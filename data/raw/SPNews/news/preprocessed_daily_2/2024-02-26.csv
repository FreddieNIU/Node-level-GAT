As a leading entity in the brokerage, wealth management, banking, and asset-management sectors, Charles Schwab Corp boasts a formidable network of branches and digital platforms, with client assets surpassing $7 trillion as of December 2022. The majority of its revenue is sourced from the U.S. market. The financial tables within the filing indicate a solid balance sheet, with significant revenue streams from both the Investor Services and Advisor Services segments. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of the company's operational strengths, potential weaknesses, growth opportunities, and external threats."", ""Market Leadership and Scale: Charles Schwab Corp's market leadership is a testament to its expansive client base and the $8.52 trillion in client assets it manages. This scale allows the company to spread operating costs and invest in new capabilities, ensuring competitive pricing and a diverse range of services. Its size also enables the firm to attract and retain talent, contributing to a robust service culture that fosters client loyalty."", ""Integrated Financial Services: The company's comprehensive suite of services, including brokerage, banking, and asset management, positions it as a one-stop financial shop for clients. This integrated approach not only deepens client relationships but also stabilizes asset retention and diversifies revenue streams, fortifying Charles Schwab Corp's financial resilience."", ""Interest Rate Sensitivity: The company's reliance on net interest revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates. As disclosed in the 10-K filing, the recent rapid increases in short-term interest rates have led to a shift in client asset allocation away from sweep cash, necessitating the use of higher-cost funding sources and impacting net income."", 'Operational Costs: Despite its scale, Charles Schwab Corp faces the challenge of managing operational costs, particularly in the wake of integrating TD Ameritrade. The 10-K filing notes increased expenses due to capital expenditures aimed at enhancing technological infrastructure, which could pressure profit margins if not managed effectively.', 'Growth in Investable Wealth: With the U.S. investable wealth market exceeding $65 trillion, Charles Schwab Corp has significant room for growth. By leveraging its trusted brand and expanding its service offerings, the company is well-positioned to capture a larger share of new and existing client assets.', 'Technological Advancements: The ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, as highlighted in the 10-K, present opportunities for Charles Schwab Corp to innovate and improve client experiences, potentially leading to increased market share and client acquisition in the digital age.', 'Regulatory Changes: The financial services industry is highly regulated, and Charles Schwab Corp is subject to changes in securities market structure and other regulatory developments. These changes could impose additional compliance costs or alter the competitive landscape, as indicated in the 10-K filing.', ""Economic and Market Risks: External economic factors, such as market volatility and geopolitical developments, can affect client asset valuations and investment behaviors. The company's performance is tied to these dynamics, which are beyond its control and could impact profitability."", 'In conclusion, Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW) stands as a titan in the financial services industry, with a strong market presence and a comprehensive range of services that cater to a diverse client base. Its scale and integrated service model are significant strengths, while its sensitivity to interest rates and operational costs pose challenges. The company is poised to capitalize on the vast opportunities in the growing wealth market and technological innovation. However, it must navigate the threats posed by regulatory changes and economic uncertainties. By continuing to focus on its ""Through Clients Eyes"" strategy and maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management, Charles Schwab Corp is well-equipped to sustain its leadership position and drive long-term shareholder value.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(NYSE:CF) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest yearly results, and the shares gained 3.5% to US$80.41. Revenues of US$6.6b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at US$7.87, missing estimates by 4.3%. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the 16 analysts covering CF Industries Holdings, is for revenues of US$6.05b in 2024. This implies an uncomfortable 8.8% reduction in CF Industries Holdings' revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to nosedive 20% to US$6.45 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.06b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.48 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", 'There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$85.31, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic CF Industries Holdings analyst has a price target of US$100.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$68.00. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await CF Industries Holdings shareholders.', ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the CF Industries Holdings' past performance and to peers in the same industry. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 8.8% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 19% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 4.4% per year. It's pretty clear that CF Industries Holdings' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$85.31, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Not only is the nearly 128-year-old index undergoing only its 52nd change with the addition of online retailer Amazon and the removal of pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, but the Dow's divisor (the figure that helps convert share price into Dow points) is changing due to Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) 3-for-1 stock split."", 'A ""stock split"" is an event which allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. The important thing to note with stock splits is that they\'re purely cosmetic and have no impact on a company\'s market cap or operating performance.', ""Forward-stock splits make a company's share price more nominally affordable for everyday investors, which can be particularly helpful for those without access to fractional-share purchases. Meanwhile, reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange."", ""Today, Monday, Feb. 26, Walmart enacted its 3-for-1 forward-stock split, which was first announced on January 30. Walmart CEO and president Doug McMillon noted the reasoning behind the split is to encourage employees to take part in Walmart's Associate Stock Purchase Plan. Said McMillon:"", 'Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates. Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.', ""Walmart has been a prime beneficiary of an above-average inflation rate over the past two years. Walmart's deep pockets and ability to buy products in large quantities gives it a cost and product breadth advantage that mom-and-pop shops simply can't match. With consumers eager for a good deal, Walmart continues to draw in shoppers."", ""Walmart joins the select group of less than a dozen high-profile companies to have conducted a forward-stock split since the midpoint of 2021. It won't, however, be the last widely owned or high-flying public company to declare a split. What follows are three outperformers that are likeliest to follow in Walmart's footsteps and become the next stock-split stocks."", ""The first logical candidate to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock after Walmart is none other than social media company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Meta hasn't split its stock since going public in 2012, and its share price neared $490 less than two weeks ago."", ""Meta's long-term success is a function of three factors. To start with, the company's social media real estate is unrivaled. It's the parent company of Facebook, the most-visited social site globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. Collectively, Meta's family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter. Having access to this many eyeballs is an advertisers' dream, which is why Meta often commands significant ad-pricing power."", ""Secondly, investors are enamored with the company's potential beyond advertising, which includes augmented and virtual reality devices, becoming an on-ramp to the metaverse, and its various artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Even though advertising makes up nearly 98% of Meta's total sales, the growth potential and addressable market for the metaverse and AI is mouthwatering."", 'The third catalyst for Meta has always been its pristine balance sheet. For example, the company closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated $71.1 billion in net cash from operating activities last year alone. It has the luxury to take chances on the innovation front that few other tech-driven companies can match.', 'A second high-flying stock that appears primed for a stock split of its own is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Since its initial public offering in early 2006 at $22 per share, Chipotle stock has rocketed to as much a $2,725 per share, as of roughly three weeks ago. Its sky-high share price is certainly a deterrent to investors without access to fractional-share purchases.', ""Chipotle's recipe for success has long revolved around the quality of its food and its innovation. The company tends to rely on locally sourced foods and vegetables, and has pledged to use only responsibly sourced meats. What Chipotle's management team has found is that consumers are willing to pay more if they're given healthier food choices. As a result, Chipotle hasn't been pinched by inflationary pressures."", 'To add to the above, the company has kept its menu reasonably small, which has two advantages. First, a smaller menu allows its employees to efficiently prepare meals and move lines quickly. Secondly, keeping the menu compact helps new product introductions pack more punch.', 'But innovation is, arguably, the real secret sauce of late. in 2018, the company introduced the ""Chipotlane,"" which is a drive-thru lane devoted to digital-order pickup. This further sped up the ordering process and improved operating efficiency, which is a key reason Chipotle\'s bottom line continues to grow by double digits each year.', ""The third highflier that looks poised to follow in Walmart's footsteps and join an exclusive club of stock-split stocks is semiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Prior to Avago acquiring Broadcom in 2016 and keeping the company's name, the original Broadcom had split its stock three times. Avago, however, never conducted a stock split. A single share of Broadcom set investors back by as much as $1,295 earlier this month."", ""Since the start of 2023, Broadcom's vast outperformance of the broader market has to do with its ties to the AI revolution. In April, the company introduced Jericho3-AI, which is designed to scale connectivity to as many as 32,000 graphics processing units in high-compute data centers. With businesses practically tripping over themselves to build out AI-accelerated data centers in order to take advantage of AI solutions, Broadcom's traditionally steady growth has turned into outsized sales growth."", 'However, Broadcom still generates a substantial portion of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories designed for next-generation smartphones. The move to 5G has encouraged a steady replacement cycle for smartphones and other wireless devices, which has proven to be a boon to its bottom line.', ""The other important factor for Broadcom is that, while tech stocks are usually cyclical, it has a presumably healthy backlog. As of July 2022, Broadcom had $31 billion in backlogged orders. Despite CEO Hock Tan not providing a recent update on the company's backlog, the flurry of order activity surrounding AI, as a whole, suggests it remains robust. A healthy backlog means dependable and predictable operating cash flow year after year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

In recent years, investors have a seen a number of high-profile tech companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla conduct stock splits. However, this is Walmart's first split in over two decades. It last completed a stock split back in 1999."", ""Let's dig into how stock splits work and what investors should understand before pouring into Walmart stock."", ""The dynamics of stock splits are quite simple: The number of shares rises by the split ratio, while the stock price drops by the same multiple. For example, following Walmart's 3-for-1 split, shareholders will have triple the amount of shares they held previously. But the price of those shares will be at one-third their original value."", ""To be clear, stock splits do not inherently change the value of a company since the number of shares increases and the share price decreases by the same ratio. However, while it's not a guarantee, share prices can rise following a split since the stock is perceived as being cheaper, thereby enticing a larger cohort of investors to buy the stock."", ""Stock-split stocks can therefore attract a lot of momentum traders. While that can be a strategy to book a quick profit, it's highly risky and can leave you holding the bag. Investors interested in Walmart stock should be thinking longer-term beyond the stock split. It's important to analyze what the company is doing to continue performing at a high level."", 'For the quarter ended Jan. 31, Walmart reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.04, a roughly 12% year-over-year decline.

To that end, it opened 159 shops in 2023, taking the year-end total to over 830 shops spread across 16 states.', 'Also, despite the intense competition, same-shop sales increased by 3% in 2023, including a 5% rise in the fourth quarter. In total, 2023 revenue rose to $966 million, a 31% yearly increase. Additionally, the company reported its first annual profit since going public, earning a net income of $10 million.', 'Such results may incentivize shareholders to overlook some of the concerns about competition that may have weighed on its stock, which fell 25% over the last year.', 'Since it is newly profitable, the P/E ratio may not accurately reflect its valuation. But its P/S ratio of less than 2 makes it a bargain compared to Starbucks, which trades at almost 3 times sales.

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. Having said that, after a brief look, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Nordstrom ."", ""There is reason to be cautious about Nordstrom, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 19% that they were earning five years ago. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Nordstrom to turn into a multi-bagger."", ""Another thing to note, Nordstrom has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 41%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower."", ""In the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock.

These devices incorporate a dsPIC33 digital signal controller (DSC), a three-phase MOSFET gate driver and optional LIN or CAN FD transceiver into one package. A significant benefit of this integration is reduction in component count of the motor control system design, smaller printed circuit board (PCB) dimensions and reduced complexity. The devices are supported by development boards, reference designs, application notes and Microchip’s field oriented control (FOC) software development suite, motorBench® Development Suite V2.45.', '“Automotive, consumer and industrial designs are evolving and require higher performance and reduced footprints. These expectations often come at a higher expense and increase in dimensional size,” said Joe Thomsen, vice president of Microchip’s digital signal controllers business unit. “By integrating multiple device functions into one chip, the dsPIC DSC-based integrated motor drivers can reduce system-level costs and board space.”', 'The integrated motor driver devices can be powered by a single power supply up to 29V (operation) and 40V (transient). An internal 3.3V low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator powers the dsPIC DSC, which eliminates the need for an external LDO to power the device. Operating between 70—100 MHz, the dsPIC DSC-based integrated motor drivers provide high CPU performance and can support efficient deployment of FOC and other advanced motor control algorithms.', 'To learn more about Microchip’s growing portfolio of integrated motor drivers visit the dsPIC DSC-Based integrated motor drivers webpage.', 'Development ToolsAn extensive ecosystem of motor control software and hardware development tools help make the design process faster and easier, reducing the customer’s time to market.', 'The dsPIC33CK Motor Control Starter Kit (MCSK)\xa0and the MCLV-48V-300W are two new dsPIC33-based integrated motor driver development boards that provide rapid prototyping solutions with flexible control options. The MCSK includes a dsPIC33CK low-voltage motor control development board, a 24V three-phase BLDC motor, an AC/DC adapter, a USB cable and other accessories. This cost-effective kit supports fast prototyping of motor control applications that operate between 12 and 48 VDC with up to 10 Amps of continuous current. The MCLV-48V-300W development board enables fast prototyping of three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors that are rated between 12 and 48 VDC and capable of delivering up to 25A RMS continuous current per phase. This inverter board introduces a new modular concept where a separate dual-in-line module (DIM) is inserted into the board to configure it for a particular dsPIC DSC or MCU.', 'The motorBench\xa0Development Suite is a free GUI-based software development tool for FOC that accurately measures critical motor parameters, automatically tunes feedback control gains and generates source code by utilizing the motor control application framework (MCAF).\xa0The latest version, v2.45, includes a powerful new feature called zero-speed/maximum torque (ZS/MT), which enables designers to eliminate Hall or magnetic sensors while maximizing the torque output from the motor, from start-up and at low speeds. This feature can be used in pumps, power tools, e-Mobility and many other applications.', 'MPLAB® Discover now contains many dsPIC DSC-based MATLAB® Simulink® models supporting various motor control algorithms and development boards. Microchip also provides free device blocks for Simulink that can be used to generate optimized code from models for dsPIC DSCs and other Microchip MCUs.', 'The growing number of dsPIC DSC-based motor control reference designs now includes an automotive cooling fan, low-voltage ceiling fan and a drone propeller controller. These reference designs shorten the time to market by providing a production-ready solution for various motor control applications. Typically, the board design files include schematics and a BOM, a board user’s guide and motor control source code that are available for download.', 'Pricing and AvailabilityFor additional information and to purchase, contact a Microchip sales representative, authorized worldwide distributor or visit Microchip’s Purchasing and Client Services website, www.microchipdirect.com.', 'ResourcesHigh-res images available through Flickr or editorial contact (feel free to publish):', 'Application image: https://www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/53077288882/sizes/o/', 'Block diagram: https://www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/53078367608/sizes/l/', 'About Microchip Technology:Microchip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

Thus, there’s no shortage of high-priced tech stocks at the moment. While it’s easy to find tech shares that are high priced, finding untapped gems becomes that much harder.', 'Tech stocks have soared over the past year as the artificial intelligence era begins. The Magnificent 7 have been the primary beneficiaries of that boom. Their success has pulled up many other tech stocks. However, there are plenty of hidden gems yet to be discovered along with some better known big name firms.', 'Let’s take a look at seven tech stocks that appear to be oversold values currently.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: testing / Shutterstock.com', 'Investors continue to be bearish about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock in early 2024. What was once one of the highest flying Chinese tech stocks is now a little more than a contrarian pick. Well, that’s the prevailing market wisdom regarding the e-commerce giant. It’s also wisdom that investors should ignore.', 'The Chinese stock market continues to be historically weak. In fact, ETfs Tracking country performance are at Lowe’s last tested in 2011. Investors aren’t particularly keen on Chinese Equity at the moment overall. That said, certain e-commerce competitors of Alibaba, namely PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), look strong primarily due to Temu.', 'That has made Alibaba and its shares look even weaker as investors wonder whether it’s time as China’s e-commerce Champion is a thing of the past. That has yet to be determined. What is known at the moment is that Alibaba’s revenues grew by 5% in the most recent quarter.', 'It remains the leading cloud firm in China. Those factors have started to sway sentiment with several big names establishing positions in Alibaba. The tide is turning in Alibaba’s favor and now is the time to get on board.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'The semiconductor sector is heating up, making Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER)\xa0one of the tech stocks primed for a breakout.', 'Bullishness pervades the sector following news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) that it expects sales to increase by 20% in 2024. Teradyne produces testing equipment vital to the industry and it should be pulled up because of the news.', 'At least, that’s what one would expect. However, Teradyne continues to face a downturn. Its most recent earnings showed revenues declined by 8%. The company continues to forecast weak demand. The reason is simple: market uncertainty. Firms simply don’t have the confidence to assume that the economy will continue to improve. Thus, they are holding back on chip testing equipment purchases for the moment.', 'What then should give investors any reason to establish a contrarian position?\xa0 One of the strongest reasons is that Teradyne may have a big opportunity in the US. The company pulled $1 billion worth of equipment out of China due to export controls in 2023. TSM strongly believes that the US chip sector will grow in 2024. Teradyne can make up those losses by pivoting into US strength.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) provides integrated circuits, more specifically, microcontrollers and microprocessors.', 'Both types of chips contain CPUs with microcontrollers also including memory and power on one integrated chip. That overly technical explanation aside, Microchip Technology is a stock worth considering.', 'The company is extremely profitable with Margins and Returns on assets and Equity that outpace roughly 95% of competitors in the semiconductor sector. Despite the company’s strong performance, it continues to trade more cheaply than 65% of its competitors based on its price-to-earnings ratio.', 'The company also released a security oriented chip in late 2023 which makes it more relevant overall. firms everywhere are increasingly concerned about security issues in the AI era. Demand for increased security and connected devices is unsurprisingly increasing because of artificial intelligence.', 'The company is looking to rebound in 2024 on weaker sales. It is attempting to do so through share buybacks and dividend payouts which is another reason to consider it.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'Investors don’t have to dig deep to find a reason STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM)\xa0stock remains undervalued.', 'One of STMicroelectronics primary revenue generators is the sale of chips to automotive manufacturers and the broader automotive industry. A big reason then for its current troubles is simply that the electric vehicle industry is going through a downturn. EVs require many more chips than do their internal combustion counterparts, thus resulting in trouble for STMicroelectronics.', 'There’s a belief that STMicroelectronics is oversold because of skepticism about the EV sector’s recovery. Sales growth is anticipated to continue to slow in 2024 as the sector attempts to move from the early adopter phase into the mass market.', 'Yet, newer chemistries will continue to drive down the costs of battery production. In turn, that could galvanize a resurgence in growth.

It will take time for those buyers to work through inventory, which will slow down sales at the company. That news sets the stage for a few positive things to happen.', 'Many companies have moved higher because of restructuring over the past year. It is entirely possible that the markets receive the news positively. Labor costs are the highest expense for firms and in that regard, Cisco Systems just improved.', 'Another reason to buy Cisco Systems now is the potential for higher dividend yields if shares keep falling. With a dividend yield of over 3%, it’s a strong income choice among tech stocks. The bargain is improving, another reason to consider Cisco Systems now.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock', 'Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) Is a fintech stock with momentum on its side.

That was a nod to headline inflation numbers which continue to confound economists.', 'Regardless, the fintech opportunity continues to be strong as the traditional finance and banking sector further digitizes in 2024 and beyond.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 14%, the S&P 500 climbed 22%, and the Nasdaq Composite soared 32%. But some Wall Street analysts still see upside in PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).', 'Brett Horn at Morningstar has set PayPal with a price target of $104 per share, implying 79% upside. Similarly, Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley has set Salesforce with a bull-case price target of $481 per share, implying 72% upside.', ""Here's what investors should know about those stocks."", 'PayPal posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 9% to $8 billion on strong growth in total payments volume. Non-GAAP net income jumped 18% to $1.6 billion due to effective expense control and share repurchases. Those numbers beat estimates, but guidance disappointed. Management said non-GAAP earnings would be flat in 2024 despite its focus on operating efficiency, including a planned 9% headcount reduction.', 'Wall Street expected non-GAAP earnings growth of 7%. But guidance fell short because payment volume on unbranded checkout products like Braintree is growing much faster than payment volume on branded checkout products. Unbranded checkout earns lower margin, and management believes that will offset any revenue growth this year.', 'On the bright side, PayPal redesigned its branded checkout experience to improve speed and reduce friction. Those changes could accelerate branded payment volume growth in the future, but guidance includes minimal contribution from new innovations because they will take time to scale. In that context, the 2024 outlook leaves room for upside if the new branded checkout scales more quickly than anticipated.', 'Ultimately, the investment thesis is unchanged and it remains compelling. PayPal dominates the online payment processing space, with nearly twice as much market share as the next closest competitor. That means revenue growth should at least match retail e-commerce sales growth in the years ahead, provided the company can maintain its market share. However, PayPal is also working to drive adoption of the Venmo debit card, which could help it gain share in physical retail.', 'With that in mind, Brett Horn at Morningstar expects PayPal to grow sales at 8% annually over the next decade. That forecast seems reasonable given that retail e-commerce sales are forecasted to grow at 8% annually through 2032. With that in mind, the current valuation of 2.2 times sales looks cheap. In fact, the stock is trading near its cheapest price-to-sales multiple in history. While I doubt shareholders will see a 79% return in the next 12 months, investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in the stock.', 'Salesforce reported better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31). Revenue increased 11% to $8.7 billion on particularly robust growth in data analytics and integration tools, followed by customer service and sales software. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income soared 48% to $2 billion as the company continued to focus on profitability. Salesforce is well positioned to maintain that momentum.', 'The investment thesis is straightforward. Salesforce is synonymous with customer relationship management (CRM) software. The company accounted for 22.1% of CRM spending through the first half of last year, which is more than the next four competitors combined. So strong is its market presence that research company G2 recognized Salesforce as the best software seller in any category in 2024.', 'Salesforce is also innovating with artificial intelligence (AI). Its CRM platform comprises productivity applications for marketing, sales, customer service, and commerce, and its Einstein Copilot brings AI capabilities to those tools. For instance, Einstein Copilot lets users generate marketing content, surface sales insights, craft personalized customer service responses, and customize online storefronts with natural language prompts.', ""Morgan Stanley's bull-case price target of $481 per share is predicated on a discounted cash flow model that assumes 16% annual sales growth through fiscal 2028 (ends Jan. 31, 2028). That is plausible given that CRM spending is forecasted to grow at 14% annually through 2030, but investors should temper their expectations."", 'Revenue increased 11% in the most recent quarter, and a similar trajectory is probable in the coming years. That estimate makes the present valuation of 8.3 times sales seems fair, despite being a slight premium to the three-year average of 7.5 times sales. Share-price appreciation to the tune of 72% is unlikely over the next 12 months, but investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in this stock today.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the ""Nifty 50"" were wildly popular. In the 1990s, ""The Four Horsemen"" grabbed investors\' attention. A few years ago, the FAANG stocks were all the rage.', 'Today, we have the ""Magnificent Seven."" With such a superlative adjective in the nickname, you\'d expect that these stocks have been huge winners -- and you\'d be right. However, winning can come at a cost. That\'s literally true with these stocks: Most of them now have premium valuations.', 'Don\'t just take my word for it. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran is widely known as the ""Dean of Valuation"" because of his expertise in valuing stocks. Damodaran recently posted on his blog, ""On every pricing metric, the Mag Seven stocks trade at a premium over the rest of the stocks in the S&P 500.""', 'But based on his own analysis, Damodaran doesn\'t think all of these seven stocks have excessive valuations. There\'s one ""Magnificent Seven"" stock that\'s not overpriced, according to the ""Dean of Valuation.""', ""It's not Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)."", 'Writing in early February, Damodaran ranked the giant chipmaker as the most expensive ""Magnificent Seven"" stock of all. At the time, he believed that Nvidia was trading nearly 56% above its fair valuation. Damodaran even posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Nvidia ""is a bridge too far for me."" He added that he planned to reduce his position in the stock by half.', 'Keep in mind that this was before Nvidia announced its blowout fourth-quarter results. The stock is now nearly 19% higher than it was when Damodaran said that it was way too expensive.', ""The NYU professor and author also wrote that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was clearly overvalued. In his blog several weeks ago, Damodaran revealed that the tech stock was trading nearly 14% above its fair valuation. Microsoft's share price has risen slightly since then."", 'Damodaran did acknowledge, though, that he might be too pessimistic about Nvidia\'s and Microsoft\'s growth prospects. He stated, ""I have built in substantial value from AI in my valuation of Nvidia, and given Microsoft significantly higher growth because of it, but it is plausible that I have not done enough.""', 'Several ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks weren\'t too far off from their fair valuations, in Damodaran\'s view. He wrote that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple, and Amazon were ""within striking distance of value.""', 'At the time he wrote those words, all three of these stocks traded at less than 9% above the fair values that Damodaran calculated. Alphabet and Apple have since fallen slightly, while Amazon has risen a little.', 'Meta Platforms looked ""close to fairly valued,"" in Damodaran\'s opinion. The stock was trading at nearly 2.5% over its fair valuation based on his analysis. However, Meta\'s share price has jumped roughly 8% since Damodaran posted his blog.', 'Damodaran determined that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock of all. He even revealed that he had bought shares of Tesla in the week before his blog was published online.', 'Ranking Tesla as the most attractively valued ""Magnificent Seven"" stock might be surprising. The electric vehicle maker\'s forward earnings multiple currently tops 63x. That doesn\'t scream inexpensive.', ""However, Damodaran factors expected growth into his valuation model. He projected that Tesla will be able to increase its revenue by a compound annual growth rate of 31.1% over the next five years. When he crunched the numbers, the stock was only 0.72% above its fair value. After rising some in recent weeks, Tesla is now a little 6% over Damodaran's calculated fair value."", 'Because of the price changes for the seven stocks, Alphabet is now closer to Damodaran\'s fair value than any other ""Magnificent Seven"" stock. Importantly, the NYU professor didn\'t assume lofty growth for Alphabet, plugging a revenue CAGR over the next five years of only 8% into his model. This relatively low growth estimate makes his calculations less susceptible to being overly optimistic.', 'In my opinion, Alphabet deserves the mantle as the cheapest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" for now. I suspect that the ""Dean of Valuation"" might agree.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The bottom-line pitch is that data is becoming a competitive edge, and Palantir helps its customers tap into their data.', ""It's still remarkably early in Palantir's growth story. The company ended 2023 with just 375 commercial accounts. There are 350,000 large corporations worldwide. Now, Palantir's top 20 customers each spend over $55 million annually on average, so this software isn't going to fit into every company's budget.

It's consistently profitable according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and analysts believe earnings could compound at 26% annually over the next three to five years. It isn't cheap, even for its expected growth, at 69 times earnings. Investors should relish a market pullback that offers up Palantir at lower prices."", ""Technology conglomerate Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has wedged itself into the AI battle, leaning on its cloud platform Azure and its strong partnership with ChatGPT and Sora creator OpenAI. Microsoft is weaving AI technology into its business, including Microsoft 365 software, Bing search, and enterprise software apps. Azure also powers AI for other companies as the world's second-leading cloud platform."", ""The great thing about Microsoft is that it's such a robust and well-rounded company that investors get some upside from AI but ultimately hold a forever stock. Microsoft generates nearly $70 billion in annual free cash flow and carries a fortress-like balance sheet with a AAA credit rating, higher than the U.S. government. In other words, Microsoft might be the world's least likely company to fail."", ""The combination of AI excitement and Microsoft's sterling reputation have priced the stock at a lofty 34 times earnings, and analysts expect earnings growth averaging 16% annually moving forward. If market weakness brings shares down from their all-time highs, investors should put Microsoft near the top of their buying list."", 'Cybersecurity is a tremendous long-term growth trend.

So Walgreens Boots Alliance, which had the lowest weight in the Dow, got the boot and lost its alliance.', 'Walgreens being booted from the Dow isn’t exactly a surprise because its share price has fallen around 60% since being added to the average in June 2018, while the Dow has risen about 60%.', 'Had Walgreens kept pace with the other 29 components, the Dow would be about 400 points higher than it is. With the Dow near 40,000, it’s easy to see what little impact even an at-pace Walgreens would have made.', 'Amazon, by contrast, has been a hot stock, one of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" that accounted for the bulk of the stock market’s gains last year.', 'Walgreens’ Dow tenure lasted less than six years — an extraordinarily short time for a market metric that doesn’t change its component stocks very often.', 'But its exit, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt insisted to me, isn’t because Walgreens has slumped and Amazon has soared.', '“We think it’s a better fit,” Silverblatt said. “We’re not saying it’s a better investment.”', 'Or, as Silverblatt put it on Yahoo Finance Live, Amazon will help the Dow stay “relevant.”', 'Now, a key question: will being added to the Dow be good for Amazon’s stock price?', 'My answer, which may surprise you, is no. Based on conversations I’ve had with market mavens over the years, I don’t think that being added to the Dow will make the slightest difference for Amazon shareholders. Just as Walgreens being kicked out won’t make any difference to Walgreens shareholders.', 'How can I say that when the Dow is such a popular market metric?', 'It’s because although the Dow has great mindshare, it has almost no financial market share compared with the hugely influential S&P 500 Index (^GSPC).', 'Let me explain.', 'The Dow is calculated based on the share prices of its 30 components. That’s why today’s three-for-one split, which reduced Walmart’s share price by two-thirds, reduced its weight in the Dow by two-thirds.', 'The S&P, on the other hand, measures companies by their total stock market value, not their nominal share price. That’s a much better way to reflect value than using share prices, which — as Walmart’s split shows — can fall substantially overnight even though nothing about the company has changed.', 'So the Dow needs to go through contortions to offset the impact of Walmart’s stock split while the S&P 500 does nothing. Walmart’s market capitalization is still around $472 billion, and that’s what counts.', 'The reason the Dow and the S&P are calculated so differently is age. The Dow was founded in 1896, when computers didn’t exist, and communication was glacial. Share prices were a quick and simple way to measure. The S&P 500, founded 61 years later, is a product of and for modern markets.', 'Read more: How to start investing in 2024: A step-by-step guide', 'This difference in calculation methodology is why a whopping $5.75 trillion of investor money is indexed to the S&P, according to Howard Silverblatt, but only $87 billion — a minuscule 1.5% as much — is indexed to the Dow.', 'Being added to the S&P has a big impact on a company’s share price because so much index money flows into it. And being dropped from the S&P hurts because all that index money flows out.', 'However, so little money (relatively speaking) is indexed to the Dow that being added to it or dropped out of it has no impact, hence why being added to the Dow won’t make any difference to Amazon’s share price.', 'One more impact of the Walgreens-Walmart-Amazon triple play: Through Friday, each dollar change in any Dow component moved the average by about 6.59 points. Monday’s number is different.', 'That’s because at Monday’s opening, the total share price of the 30 Dow components is different from the number at Friday’s close.', 'So the Dowfolk had to tweak something called the Dow Divisor, which as of Friday was a wonderfully precise 0.15172752595384 and is equally precise today. Divide one by the divisor, and you see how much each dollar change in any Dow component moves the Dow.', 'The history of how the Dow Divisor came to be and how to tweak it to create your very own Dow is a lot of fun for those of us who like numbers.', 'But that’s a subject for another day.', 'Allan Sloan is an award-winning financial journalist and contributor to Yahoo Finance.', 'Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.', 'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance']"

The company's Software Integrity segment has already experienced the effects of budget scrutiny from customers, highlighting the need for Synopsys to diversify its revenue sources and reduce dependence on any single market segment."", ""Integration Challenges: Synopsys' aggressive acquisition strategy, while a strength, also poses integration risks. The company must effectively integrate acquired businesses and technologies to realize the anticipated benefits. Challenges such as cultural differences, systems integration, and aligning business processes can impede the smooth assimilation of new entities, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs.

The convergence of semiconductor companies moving up-stack and systems companies moving down-stack presents a significant opportunity for Synopsys to expand its customer base. By continuing to innovate and offer comprehensive EDA solutions, Synopsys can attract new customers from diverse industries seeking to design in-house chips, thereby expanding its market share and revenue potential.', 'Technological Advancements: The ongoing evolution of technology, including the rise of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 5G, offers Synopsys ample opportunities to develop and market new products that cater to these trends. As companies across sectors seek to incorporate these technologies into their products, Synopsys can leverage its expertise in EDA software and semiconductor IP to meet the growing demand for advanced design capabilities. This positions the company to be at the forefront of technological innovation and to benefit from the growth of these emerging markets.', ""Geopolitical Tensions: Synopsys Inc (NASDAQ:SNPS) operates globally, making it vulnerable to geopolitical risks and conflicts that can disrupt its business operations. Tensions in regions like the Middle East and Armenia, where Synopsys has a presence, could impact its employees, customers, and strategic partners. While the company actively monitors these situations, any escalation could lead to material adverse effects on its business and financial condition. Additionally, changes in U.S. export control regulations, particularly those affecting China's access to semiconductor and advanced computing technology, could pose challenges for Synopsys' international sales and supply chain."", 'Competitive Pressures: The EDA software market is highly competitive, with several established players vying for market share.

Shares are up nearly 60% in the last 12 months, including a more than 12% increase so far in 2024.

Can Cadence continue its hot streak?', ""The Millennium M1 AI supercomputer is really a server, a large computing unit that can be installed either on a company's property (in an office, a private data center, etc.) or deployed in the cloud and accessed via an internet connection. Specifically, Cadence designed this computing platform for accelerating computational fluid dynamics, or CFD."", 'It\'s a type of analytics and simulation software used in the design of all sorts of things -- including auto engines and how cars will behave driving down the freeway, jet engines and how a plane will fly, and industrial and manufacturing processes using liquids and other materials. Really, anything that ""flows"" can be analyzed and simulated using CFD.', 'Cadence\'s Millennium Platform, powered by the Millennium M1, is the first CFD and multi-physics simulation product that uses a purpose-built supercomputer for performing such complex computations. Think of it as a turbocharged ""digital twin"" platform, enabling engineering teams to visualize how a product or project will behave in the wild, before ever manufacturing or building it.', 'Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been talking about the massive potential for digital twins for some time, especially when the metaverse was all the rage a couple of years ago. But CFD and multi-physics simulation actually has some of the most promising potential in the business world.', 'Cadence has been gearing up for this, even hinting at a big Nvidia product release event a year ago that it was working on big things in CFD.', 'For reference, these big moves in CFD -- really a type of convergence between the digital and physical worlds -- are why Cadence peer Synopsys\xa0is acquiring simulation software provider Ansys, and why hardware testing company Keysight Technologies\xa0made a simulation-software acquisition of its own last year.', 'So does Millennium give Cadence a leg up on the competition? It certainly could.', 'Cadence and Synopsys are the two dominant players in semiconductor design software (called EDA, or electronic design automation). Lots of new devices with chips embedded in them coming to market refill the sails of these two industry giants.', ""However, Synopsys' move on Ansys will mean significant debt will need to be paid off if the deal is finalized (perhaps in 2025). Meanwhile, Cadence is developing its own services that converge chip design with more mechanical processes in-house. Put another way, its clean balance sheet and best-in-class profit margins will remain intact, while Synopsys will have to digest its acquisition (again, if it happens)."", ""After a stellar 2023 that featured soaring profitability, though, Cadence stock is expensive at nearly 50 times expected earnings for 2024. With a valuation like that, even a significant 20%-plus pullback in the share price won't make Cadence cheap."", 'But innovations like its new AI supercomputer, powered by GPUs and other high-end hardware and software algorithms, make Cadence a premium stock for good reason. Be patient with this investment in 2024, and consider a dollar-cost average plan if long-term ownership of Cadence Design Systems fits your portfolio needs.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cadence Design Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cadence Design Systems, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cadence Design Systems wasn’t one of them.

LLC as financial advisor to assist in a review of strategic alternatives for its architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada.', 'PPG’s architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada, which operates within the company’s performance coatings segment, is an industry leader in residential and commercial architectural coatings through its well-known portfolio of brands, including GLIDDEN®, OLYMPIC®, LIQUID NAILS®, HOMAX®, PITTSBURGH PAINTS & STAINS®, Manor Hall®, FLOOD®, DULUX® (in Canada), and SICO®, among others. The business manufactures and sells interior and exterior paints, stains, caulks, repair products, adhesives, and sealants for homeowners and professionals. It also includes certain light-duty protective coatings products that are primarily sold through company-owned stores and manufactured through a common factory footprint.', 'In total, the distribution network includes more than 15,000 touchpoints through company-owned stores, independent dealer locations, and major home improvement centers and retailers across the U.S. and Canada. In 2023, the architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada represented approximately 10% of PPG’s total net sales.', 'PPG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Knavish, said, ""The architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada has a well-established position in a growing market, leading brands, proven innovation, established customers, and dedicated and talented employees. We have made considerable progress over the past several years in modernizing the architectural coatings business model to better position the business for continued success. This has included instituting value-added customer-facing digital tools, revamping our manufacturing and distribution footprint, transitioning towards an asset-light distribution model, and introducing innovative products that enhance customer productivity and sustainability. Our actions over the past several years have created positive momentum in the business as we have significantly increased the number of distribution points for our well-known brands. These changes have been recognized in the industry and validate the progress of the business’ transformed strategy. The business is now poised to accelerate this transformation.', '""We are exploring this strategic review now given the positive momentum in the business, with the intent of ensuring its continued growth and success while also maximizing the value for PPG and its shareholders. We will assess whether some or all of the business could be better suited to grow faster with a partner or different owner, or may be better suited to operate as a core business within another company, as a standalone entity, or in a joint venture. Our review will help to determine if any of these alternative structures will provide the business with more speed and accelerated growth capability. Throughout this process, we will continue to fully support the business, our employees, and our architectural coatings customers throughout the U.S. and Canada.', '""In January, we announced a strategic review of alternatives for our silica products business and are now also conducting a review of our architectural coatings U.S. and Canada business. These actions reflect a regular and disciplined strategic assessment process by our Board and management team, including ensuring each of our businesses delivers value for our customers and shareholders, and aligns with the growth and investment strategies for the company,"" said Knavish.', 'Despite the business delivering flat sales volumes in 2023, on a 3-year pro forma basis PPG’s overall company sales volume results would have improved cumulatively by over 200 basis points excluding the architectural coatings U.S. and Canada business. Also, the company’s Performance Coatings segment operating (EBIT) income, excluding the U.S. and Canada architectural coatings EBIT and the associated growth-related investments we have made, would have resulted in an approximately 300-basis point improvement in segment margins in 2023.', 'The timing and outcome of the strategic review is uncertain.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$518.1m', 'US$556.1m', 'US$687.0m', 'US$690.7m', 'US$698.0m', 'US$707.9m', 'US$719.9m', 'US$733.3m', 'US$748.0m', 'US$763.5m', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 0.53%', 'Est @ 1.06%', 'Est @ 1.43%', 'Est @ 1.69%', 'Est @ 1.87%', 'Est @ 1.99%', 'Est @ 2.08%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% ', 'US$479', 'US$475', 'US$542', 'US$504', 'US$470', 'US$441', 'US$414', 'US$390', 'US$367', 'US$347', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.4b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mattel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.289. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Today, its yield is 3.6%, which is basically just average for a utility, using Vanguard Utilities ETF as a proxy. However, that happens to be near the highest yield this stock has offered in a decade. This suggests that NextEra Energy is cheap today. Don't miss out on this opportunity."", 'NextEra Energy is a mixture of a slow and steady regulated utility (largely Florida Power & Light) and a fast growing renewable power business (NextEra is one of the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world). This combination has allowed NextEra Energy to grow its dividend at an annualized rate of 10% over the past decade. Half of that figure would be considered pretty good in the utility sector. In other words, this is a rare dividend growth stock in what is traditionally seen as a boring sector.', ""That can have huge benefits for dividend growth investors. Given NextEra's historically high yield, it can add diversification to a portfolio that will probably be lacking utility exposure. And another year of strong 10% dividend growth is expected in 2024 (a rate it expects to continue through 2026), with solid earnings growth (6% to 8% a year) expected through at least 2026. Simply put, the future still looks pretty bright. This is an opportunity to buy a great dividend growth utility at a very attractive price, don't let it slip by you."", ""Matt DiLallo (Clearway Energy): Clearway Energy is one of the largest renewable energy generators in the country. It also operates a portfolio of environmentally sound natural gas power plants. The company's clean energy assets generate very stable cash flow backed by fixed-rate power purchase agreements with utilities and large corporate buyers."", 'It uses its steady cash to pay an attractive dividend (currently yielding 7.1%) and invest in new renewable energy assets. Clearway currently expects to grow its high-yielding payout toward the upper end of its 5% to 8% annual target range through 2026. ', 'The main factor powering that plan is its capital recycling strategy. Clearway cashed in on its thermal assets in 2022, netting about $1.3 billion in cash proceeds. It has been steadily reinvesting that money into higher-returning renewable energy projects. Last year, it committed to invest $215 million in wind, solar, storage, and wind repowering projects that should start generating power and cash flow this year. Meanwhile, it has lined up potential deals to reinvest the remaining proceeds into high-return renewable projects. That gives it the line of sight to grow its cash available for dividends from $342 million last year to $435 million in the future. ', 'The company is starting to gain more visibility into growth beyond 2026. The rates on recent contract renewals for some of its natural gas power plants are coming in at levels that could support the low end of its dividend growth target range in 2027.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) so let's look a bit deeper."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Patterson Companies:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.16 = US$286m ÷ (US$2.9b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""Therefore, Patterson Companies has an ROCE of 16%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Patterson Companies ."", ""Patterson Companies has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 133%. The company is now earning US$0.2 per dollar of capital employed. In regards to capital employed, Patterson Companies appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 27% less capital to run its operation. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company."", ""For the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. The current liabilities has increased to 40% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase."", ""In summary, it's great to see that Patterson Companies has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 52% return over the last five years. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."", 'Patterson Companies does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those make us uncomfortable...', ""While Patterson Companies may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

(Nasdaq: OBIO, “Orchestra BioMed” or the “Company”), a biomedical company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships, today announced the presentation of new data demonstrating the long-term effect of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy (also known as BackBeat CNT™) on generating clinically-meaningful reductions in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (“aSBP”) in pacemaker-indicated patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the use of antihypertensive medications. The data were presented by Avi Fischer, M.D., Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs and Innovation of Orchestra BioMed in a scientific session at the Innovation in Cardiovascular Interventions (“ICI”) 2024 Meeting.', '“People who suffer from hypertension face a lifelong burden of blood pressure management. This is particularly relevant in the pacemaker-indicated population of older patients who have a higher risk of other co-morbidities and adverse clinical outcomes,” commented Dr. Fischer. “These new long-term follow up data demonstrate AVIM therapy’s ability to drive a substantial and sustained reduction in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure, the gold standard, and most accurate measure of hypertension. Seeing substantial sustained ambulatory blood pressure reductions in patients treated with AVIM therapy for over three and a half years on average reinforces our confidence in the potential of this novel therapy to have a clinically meaningful and long-lasting beneficial effect on hypertensive pacemaker patients.”', 'Reduction in aSBP measured at 6 months from randomization and therapy activation was the primary endpoint of the MODERATO II study, a European multi-center, double-blind, randomized pilot study involving 47 subjects. Patients randomized to AVIM therapy and antihypertension medication in that study experienced an 11.1 mmHg (p<0.001) reduction in mean aSBP at 6 months follow-up, resulting in a statistically significant difference of 8.1 mmHg compared to control patients who were managed only with antihypertensive medications (p=0.01).1', 'Long-term blood pressure results are from a follow-up study of 16 patients originally enrolled in the MODERATO II study. This group included eight patients from the MODERATO II AVIM treatment arm and eight control arm patients that crossed over to AVIM therapy at the end of the 6-month double-blind phase. Each patient’s aSBP was measured an average of 3.6 (±0.6) years following original initiation of AVIM therapy. As a group and based on individual paired data, these patients continued to experience a statistically significant, clinically meaningful mean aSBP reduction of 8.9 mmHg, identical to the 8.9 mmHg mean reduction in aSBP seen in this same group of patients at the 6-month primary aSBP measurement endpoint of the original study.', 'AVIM therapy is an investigational patented bioelectronic therapy, administered using a standard dual-chamber pacemaker, designed to immediately, substantially and persistently reduce blood pressure. Orchestra BioMed and Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) (“Medtronic”) formed a strategic collaboration for the development and commercialization of AVIM therapy for hypertensive pacemaker patients in July 2022. If AVIM therapy is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Medtronic will have exclusive global rights to commercialize AVIM-enabled pacing systems for this target population, and Orchestra BioMed will share in the revenues generated from Medtronic sales of the AVIM-enabled pacing systems.', 'Orchestra BioMed is actively enrolling patients in the BACKBEAT pivotal study, a global, multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind study investigating the efficacy and safety of AVIM therapy in patients who have recently undergone implantation of a Medtronic dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker and have uncontrolled hypertension despite the use of antihypertensive medications.

HTN accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis and leads to increased risk of major cardiac events like heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease and other end organ damage. HTN is the leading global risk factor for death, affecting an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide. In the United States, 122 million adults, or approximately 47% of all adults, are estimated to have HTN. While many patients do not notice high blood pressure, cardiovascular risk doubles for every 10-mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and the mortality rate doubles with an increase of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure.2', 'It is estimated that more than 70% of the approximately 1.1 million people globally who are implanted with cardiac pacemakers each year are also diagnosed with HTN. Based on updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, an even higher percentage (approximately 80%) of U.S. patients that are indicated for the implant of a pacemaker have HTN. Pacemaker patients tend to be elderly and are more likely to suffer from co-morbidities such as atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, and harder to treat effectively with medical therapy for many reasons including co-morbidities and a high prevalence of isolated systolic HTN.', 'About AVIM Therapy (BackBeat CNT™)', 'AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized, pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The global IDE pivotal BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation\xa0for\xa0Blood prEssure treAtmenT)\xa0study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.', 'About Orchestra BioMed ', 'Orchestra BioMed (Nasdaq: OBIO) is a biomedical innovation company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships with leading medical device companies.

A lack of international certification means the aircraft cannot operate commercially in most countries unless they recognize certifications by China’s civil aviation regulator.', ""Over the course of last week's airshow, which drew over nearly 120,000 trade and public visitors, the C919 performed fly-pasts, allowing visitors to see the jet in action. Its only previous foray outside mainland China was to Hong Kong in December."", '“It’s quite symbolic and a major milestone in that push by China to become considered, alongside Airbus and Boeing, for commercial aircrafts,” said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst based in Singapore.', 'COMAC aims to compete with companies like Boeing and Airbus in the single-aisle jet market. But first, the C919 has to be certified internationally, he said.', 'The plane is currently certified only in China, where China Eastern Airlines are operating four C919 aircrafts. A lack of international certification means the C919 cannot operate in most countries unless they recognize certifications by China’s civil aviation regulator.', 'Another aspect COMAC needs to work on before its jets can become serious contenders alongside the Airbus A320neo and Boeing’s 737 Max narrow-body airliners is building up a reliable distribution system and market support services for its aircraft.', '“Most of the orders come from Chinese airlines and the challenge moving forward is that in order to have a sustainable future, COMAC must demonstrate that they are able to go beyond Chinese shores,” said Mabel Kwan, managing director at consultancy Alton Aviation.', 'COMAC declined to make its executives available for an interview.', 'So far, the state-owned company says it has received 1,061 domestic orders for the C919, but it has yet to secure many international customers. Brunei-based GallopAir, which is backed by Chinese investors, signed a letter of intent in September to purchase 30 aircraft from COMAC, including a C919 jet, in a deal estimated to be worth $2 billion.', 'COMAC faces supply chain challenges similar to those of Boeing and Airbus, which currently have backlogs of thousands of aircraft yet to be delivered. While the C919 is designed in China, much of its technology and many of its parts are from foreign suppliers. Its engine, for example, is made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and France’s Safran Aircraft Engines.', '“It’s not like China has its own supply system, its own avionics, its own engines, so that they’re not impacted by what’s happening globally,” Sobie said, adding that COMAC might not be a high priority for suppliers also struggling to catch up with deliveries to Boeing and Airbus.', 'COMAC however does have the luxury of a wide talent pool from China, Kwan said, and in the long run this may allow the firm to develop more homegrown technology and parts for use in its aircraft.', '“Right now, COMAC is using mostly Western technology … but with enough research & development, training and education, the whole ecosystem may be able to overcome (challenges in the long term),” she said.']"

In Nike's case, I don't think anyone disagrees with the perspective that the company's brand is its greatest asset. Selling commoditized clothes and shoes has turned into a massive and profitable business because of how Nike is able to resonate with consumers across the globe."", 'Credit goes to product innovation, top-notch marketing proficiency, and a heightened focus on bolstering the digital foundation. These strategic priorities give me confidence that Nike will still be around decades from now.', 'The brand has helped lead to steady revenue and profit growth over the years. Nike is truly an international company, so it can lean on emerging markets to drive top-line gains as things mature in the U.S.', ""And driving profitability isn't an issue. In the last five years, Nike's quarterly gross and operating margins have averaged 44% and 12%, respectively. This situation has resulted in consistent free-cash-flow generation, which Nike uses to buy back shares and pay a dividend, boosting investor returns."", 'All of these favorable attributes are compelling reasons to want to own the stock.', ""It's hard to ignore the fact that Nike is dealing with a slowdown.

That looks expensive, but I think it's because Nike has been under-earning in the last few quarters, which can drive up that valuation multiple. In other words, in normal circumstances, with fewer markdowns and less promotional activity, the business should have reported higher net income, which would lower the P/E ratio to a more compelling level."", ""But regardless of your perspective on valuation, the real question comes down to whether or not this is still a great business.

And once economic conditions improve and consumer confidence rises, Nike should return to solid growth."", ""I'm not so sure that this is the case, though. What concerns me is a real possibility that Nike's struggles point to bigger issues for the brand. Just look at management's previous financial forecasts. At the end of fiscal 2021, the company predicted that sales would increase at a high-single-digit percentage (at the low end) annually, and the operating margin would be in the high teens.

(NYSE:NKE) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase NIKE's shares before the 1st of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 1st of April."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.37 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.48 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, NIKE has a trailing yield of approximately 1.4% on its current stock price of US$105.63. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether NIKE has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' See our latest analysis for NIKE ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see NIKE paying out a modest 40% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 33% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's positive to see that NIKE's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see NIKE has grown its earnings rapidly, up 24% a year for the past five years. NIKE is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, NIKE has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", ""Is NIKE an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that NIKE is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about NIKE, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", 'Ever wonder what the future holds for NIKE?

However, over the past several years a number of new services have emerged, giving incumbents a run for their money.', ""While PayPal is still a leading fintech service for both consumers and merchants, rising competition and a lack of innovation have caused investors to sour on the stock. As PayPal currently sits at a crossroads, some investors might be wondering if it's time to move on."", ""One analyst on Wall Street isn't convinced that PayPal's best days are behind it. Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities recently maintained his price target of $85 on PayPal stock, implying a rise of roughly 45% from current trading levels. Let's dig into why Katri remains bullish on PayPal, and assess whether now is a time to scoop up shares at a discount."", 'PayPal ended 2023 with 426 million active accounts on its platform. While this was modestly lower than in the previous year, management cleared the air during fourth-quarter earnings by explaining that unengaged accounts in non-core markets comprised the bulk of the churn.', ""Nevertheless, PayPal's active user base remains highly engaged. Given that PayPal derives the majority of its revenue from fees attached to these payments, it's crucial that the company not only expand its user base, but keep these accounts. Given that total payment volume (TPV) increased 13% in 2023 and eclipsed $1.5 trillion, it's clear that PayPal plays a critical role in the world of e-commerce."", ""Another positive aspect of PayPal's business is its ability to generate sustained free cash flow. The company reported $4.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023, and forecast $5 billion in 2024 during the Q4 earnings call."", ""With more than $17 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, PayPal's financial profile looks quite strong. Let's dig into the company's valuation to get a better sense of just how far the stock has fallen."", ""The chart above illustrates that PayPal's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2 is roughly two-thirds lower than its long-term average since becoming a public company."", ""It's important to keep in mind that during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, PayPal's business experienced unprecedented demand as people flocked to online shopping. However, even in a post-pandemic environment, it seems that PayPal's valuation has dropped off a cliff as opposed to simply normalizing."", ""Earlier this year, PayPal Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss showcased a number of new products and services that PayPal will be implementing. Many of these features will rely heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and are aimed at better monetizing many of PayPal's acquired properties, such as peer-to-peer payments app Venmo."", ""On the surface, these enhancements were a much-needed upgrade to PayPal's platform. However, the jury is still out on whether these new products will yield the intended return on investment. Even though PayPal clearly has demonstrated that it can acquire a critical mass of users who are engaged on the platform, it's not totally clear if the company can bolster engagement through these new products."", ""To me, PayPal has a unique business given its penetration across both merchants and customers. However, I think PayPal hasn't done the best job stitching these two sides together. In some ways, it feels as if PayPal is more of a bespoke digital payments platform as opposed to a true ecosystem -- which I think it has the potential to become."", ""It's encouraging to see management aggressively deploying capital into new areas for growth. But the precipitous decline in the stock could be a sign that many investors have doubts about PayPal's prospects. With the fintech landscape intensifying quickly, I don't think management has been granted much leeway to prove that its new AI-powered services will change things."", ""Given that many of the company's innovations are new to market, investors should expect some lag time before they catch on at scale. For now, a prudent approach could be to monitor PayPal's progress throughout the year, and use dollar-cost averaging as you see fit should PayPal's long-term outlook meet your risk criteria."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 14%, the S&P 500 climbed 22%, and the Nasdaq Composite soared 32%. But some Wall Street analysts still see upside in PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).', 'Brett Horn at Morningstar has set PayPal with a price target of $104 per share, implying 79% upside. Similarly, Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley has set Salesforce with a bull-case price target of $481 per share, implying 72% upside.', ""Here's what investors should know about those stocks."", 'PayPal posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 9% to $8 billion on strong growth in total payments volume. Non-GAAP net income jumped 18% to $1.6 billion due to effective expense control and share repurchases. Those numbers beat estimates, but guidance disappointed. Management said non-GAAP earnings would be flat in 2024 despite its focus on operating efficiency, including a planned 9% headcount reduction.', 'Wall Street expected non-GAAP earnings growth of 7%. But guidance fell short because payment volume on unbranded checkout products like Braintree is growing much faster than payment volume on branded checkout products. Unbranded checkout earns lower margin, and management believes that will offset any revenue growth this year.', 'On the bright side, PayPal redesigned its branded checkout experience to improve speed and reduce friction. Those changes could accelerate branded payment volume growth in the future, but guidance includes minimal contribution from new innovations because they will take time to scale. In that context, the 2024 outlook leaves room for upside if the new branded checkout scales more quickly than anticipated.', 'Ultimately, the investment thesis is unchanged and it remains compelling. PayPal dominates the online payment processing space, with nearly twice as much market share as the next closest competitor. That means revenue growth should at least match retail e-commerce sales growth in the years ahead, provided the company can maintain its market share. However, PayPal is also working to drive adoption of the Venmo debit card, which could help it gain share in physical retail.', 'With that in mind, Brett Horn at Morningstar expects PayPal to grow sales at 8% annually over the next decade. That forecast seems reasonable given that retail e-commerce sales are forecasted to grow at 8% annually through 2032. With that in mind, the current valuation of 2.2 times sales looks cheap. In fact, the stock is trading near its cheapest price-to-sales multiple in history. While I doubt shareholders will see a 79% return in the next 12 months, investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in the stock.', 'Salesforce reported better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31). Revenue increased 11% to $8.7 billion on particularly robust growth in data analytics and integration tools, followed by customer service and sales software. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income soared 48% to $2 billion as the company continued to focus on profitability. Salesforce is well positioned to maintain that momentum.', 'The investment thesis is straightforward. Salesforce is synonymous with customer relationship management (CRM) software. The company accounted for 22.1% of CRM spending through the first half of last year, which is more than the next four competitors combined. So strong is its market presence that research company G2 recognized Salesforce as the best software seller in any category in 2024.', 'Salesforce is also innovating with artificial intelligence (AI). Its CRM platform comprises productivity applications for marketing, sales, customer service, and commerce, and its Einstein Copilot brings AI capabilities to those tools. For instance, Einstein Copilot lets users generate marketing content, surface sales insights, craft personalized customer service responses, and customize online storefronts with natural language prompts.', ""Morgan Stanley's bull-case price target of $481 per share is predicated on a discounted cash flow model that assumes 16% annual sales growth through fiscal 2028 (ends Jan. 31, 2028). That is plausible given that CRM spending is forecasted to grow at 14% annually through 2030, but investors should temper their expectations."", 'Revenue increased 11% in the most recent quarter, and a similar trajectory is probable in the coming years. That estimate makes the present valuation of 8.3 times sales seems fair, despite being a slight premium to the three-year average of 7.5 times sales. Share-price appreciation to the tune of 72% is unlikely over the next 12 months, but investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in this stock today.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Wall Street may be in the midst of a fresh bull market, but there's still a lot of turbulence to deal with. But there's a handy shortcut available if you're looking for investments with the business-growth promise of exciting tech stocks and the long-term stability of a blue-chip business titan."", ""The trick is to look for solid dividends. Even in Silicon Valley, a generous dividend suggests robust cash profits and a relatively calm stock chart. By virtue of pure mathematics, dividend yields fall when stock prices are skyrocketing, so a strong payout leads you away from overly expensive stocks. On the flip side of the same equation, you're not looking for extremely high yields which typically spring from deep share price dives."", 'And on that note, I see a couple of top-quality tech stocks with dividends in the Goldilocks zone -- just right for starting a low-risk tech investment right now. Let me show you why International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) tick all the right boxes for dividend investors in February 2024.', ""Big Blue invariably comes to mind whenever I think about a solid commitment to dividend payouts. IBM's unbroken streak of annual dividend increases started with a 40% boost in January of 1996. The split-adjusted quarterly payouts have increased from $0.063 to $1.66 per share, which works out to a 28-year gain of 2,560%:"", 'The dividend boosts have been modest since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but those symbolic increases never stopped. Even better, the dividend checks were always directly funded by free cash flows, with the cash-based payout ratio topping out at 85% in the inflation crisis of 2022.', 'Even, even better, Big Blue is finally reaping the rewards of a strategy shift that started more than a decade ago. The IBM you see today has reshaped its business model with a laser-like focus on high-growth markets such as data security, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI).', 'Yeah, you heard me. IBM has not-so-quietly built a world-class business around its Watson AI platform. The company was a little late to the AI boom since it takes its enterprise-class clients a while to run new solutions through testing and management approvals, but the financial benefits have started to trickle in.', 'So IBM gives you generous, cash-backed dividends alongside a highly promising future of high-margin AI services. Not too shabby, right? And the only clue needed to arrive at this incredible investment today was that juicy but still affordable 3.6% dividend yield.', ""Let's shift gears without leaving the neighborhood. Intel's semiconductor fortunes have been intertwined with IBM's software and systems since the beginning of time (in terms of the fast-moving tech sector, anyway)."", ""Intel's dividend chart is less pristine, but for good reason. You see, the tech titan is pulling every available lever to expand its chip-making capacity, building and boosting manufacturing facilities around the world. This effort involved a steep dividend cut in 2023, rising debt balances, and accepting a few quarters of negative cash flows."", ""In return, Intel now runs one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing services for other chip designers. That's a sharp strategy shift, taking advantage of the Biden administration's CHIPS Act and a long-running global shortage of chip-building capacity."", ""Today, Intel's stock gives you a different kind of hardware giant whose negative cash flows should spring back from the red-ink bath over the next couple of years. Playing an infrastructure role in this AI-driven era of high demand for memory chips and number-crunching processors could be a genius move in the long run, to the point where it almost looks like Intel's management saw the AI frenzy coming from a mile away. The timing is just too perfect."", ""Oh, and Intel's dividend yield peaked just below 6% before the payout cuts. That's uncomfortably high, especially when the company needs extra cash for business-building purposes. The current yield of 1.1% is on the low side of that just-right zone but still respectable enough.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at AES (NYSE:AES) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on AES is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.068 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$43b - US$8.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, AES has an ROCE of 6.8%.

If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering AES  for free."", ""The returns on capital haven't changed much for AES in recent years. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 6.8% and the business has deployed 21% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments."", ""In conclusion, AES has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased.

From market highs during the early days of the pandemic to the market doldrums that followed, long-term investors have dealt with regular bouts of volatility. In the early days of 2024, the market has clocked numerous fresh highs, a sign that investors are feeling more optimistic than they were a year ago, even though worries about the global economy persist.', 'No matter what the market does in the coming months, consistently building stock positions that can deliver long-term portfolio growth can help you construct a basket of holdings that can weather many market storms. Here are two top growth stocks to consider adding to your portfolio right now.', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) dealt with a tough time earlier in the pandemic as changes in procedure volumes occurred in key markets, as many people put off surgeries. Throughout that time, the company continued to report steady revenue growth and consistent profitability.', 'In 2023, the company had a banner year on multiple fronts, a testament to the strength of its business and core revenue model. Intuitive Surgical manufactures and sells surgical robotics systems, and they cost a pretty penny. Its flagship da Vinci surgical system costs anywhere from $0.7 million to $2.5 million. However, the company makes even more money from recurring revenue sources.', ""Given the intricacy and cost of these surgical systems, once a hospital or other medical provider acquires one through a purchase, sales-type lease, or usage-based agreement, there's a significant incentive to maintain these systems. That's due to the intensive capital investment involved, and the time required to learn how to use them. And Intuitive Surgical provides just about every service and solution imaginable to meet the needs of its customers, from replacement tools to customer support solutions to training courses to software."", 'The single-largest source of revenue for Intuitive Surgical -- and recurring revenue at that -- is from the instruments and accessories it sells to go with these systems. Any surgical instrument or accessory has a limited usage period, which means that the company earns anywhere from $700 to $3,600 of instruments and accessories revenue for every surgery performed using one of its da Vinci systems.', 'Recurring revenue -- which is derived from sales of instruments and accessories, as well as other sources such as operating leases -- comprised 83% of total revenue in the full-year 2023. Last year, Intuitive Surgical generated overall revenue of $7.1 billion, a 14% increase from 2022. It also reported net income of $1.8 billion, a 35% growth rate.', ""Demand for robotic surgical systems is only growing, thanks to the benefits for patients across a wide range of surgical types. Given Intuitive Surgical's market leadership in this space and continued financial strength, this looks like a company that can continue contributing steady growth rates to a long-term investor's portfolio."", 'Fiverr (NYSE: FVRR) became a favorite with many investors in the earlier days of the pandemic when the work-from-home surge occurred and the gig economy witnessed explosive growth. However, this space continues to see steady gains, even as macroeconomic difficulty continues.', 'A 2023 report released by the World Bank found that an astonishing 12% of the entire global labor market could be attributable to the gig economy. Everyone from small mom-and-pop businesses to large global brands is using freelancers.', ""In turn, there's a significant opportunity for workers across a range of skill sets to earn a primary or secondary income in a flexible online setting. These are value propositions that are hard to pass up for both buyers or sellers of freelance services, and Fiverr is one of the platforms at the forefront of this explosive space."", ""The company is focusing heavily on growing its base of skilled freelancers and enterprise buyers of freelance services. It's also made steady progress in increasing its take rate of transactions, driven by rising adoption of its programs like Seller Plus and Promoted Gigs."", ""Seller Plus offers tiered subscription options for sellers that give them access to benefits like advanced analytics and faster payouts for completed gigs. Promoted Gigs is essentially a paid ad program that allows certain qualifying freelancers to heighten the visibility of their freelance services to buyers. Fiverr's take rate of 31.3% by the end of the third quarter of 2023 was a notable step up from its take rate of 27% three years ago and 26.6% four years ago."", ""The company brought in a revenue of $353 million over the trailing-12-month period. It's also proven to be a cash-flow machine, with operating cash flow in that period totaling $65 million and levered free cash flow coming in at $41 million for the trailing 12 months.

Here's what it could mean for investors in those companies."", ""Capital One provides its customers with various financial and banking services and is the ninth-largest bank in the U.S. The company's bread-and-butter business is issuing branded cards through Visa and Mastercard. It's the fourth-largest card issuer in the U.S., according to The Nilson Report."", 'This deal is turning a lot of heads, and for good reason. Capital One issues debit and credit cards through Mastercard and Visa, with its transactions running through their networks and earning them fees on every swipe. Meanwhile, Capital One holds on to this credit card debt and services these loans. The merger could make Capital One the largest credit card lender in the U.S., pushing it ahead of JPMorgan Chase, which currently holds that title.', ""In addition, it would provide Capital One with Discover's payment networks, including Discover Network, Diners Club, and Pulse debit network, which have struggled to compete with Visa and Mastercard for payment volume. If the deal goes through, Capital One could move its cards to Discover's network and create a closed-loop payment network that better competes with Visa and Mastercard."", 'This is where things get interesting with regulators. On the one hand, they have expressed concern about Capital One being the largest card issuer in the U.S. On the other hand, those same regulators want more competition from different payment networks to better contend with Visa and Mastercard, who they claim have a duopoly over payment processing.', ""According to data from The Nilson Report, Visa processed $11.6 trillion in payment volume in 2022, while Mastercard had $6.6 trillion. American Express had $1.5 trillion. In comparison, Discover's networks processed $243 billion, or only 2% of Visa's payment volume."", ""According to analysts with Morgan Stanley, Capital One's existing debit card portfolio is primarily Mastercard-branded, where it does about $100 billion in volume annually. In addition, it has about $75 billion in credit card volume between Visa and Mastercard."", ""Those analysts say that if Capital One were to move its volumes over to Discover, it would have a 0.2% effect on Visa and a 2.1% effect on Mastercard's payment volume. Any effect on Visa's or Mastercard's bottom line would likely be negligible."", 'Before the Capital One-Discover deal can go through, it must face heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and consumer groups. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that the merger ""threatens our financial stability, reduces competition, and would increase fees and credit costs for American families,"" and asked regulators to ""block it immediately.""', 'In addition, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said, ""This merger will create a new juggernaut in the credit card market, with unprecedented powers to extort American consumers. That cannot be allowed to happen."" With opposition from both sides of the aisle, the deal will likely face significant headwinds before any approval.', ""The Capital One-Discover deal would be the fifth-largest bank merger in U.S. history. If it goes through, Visa and Mastercard would certainly feel some effects, although it wouldn't put too big a dent in their earnings. However, the deal has significant hurdles to overcome and its approval could hinge on election results in November, so a decision likely won't be made until later this year or 2025."", ""Investors should continue to monitor this deal. It could create an intriguing investment opportunity in the combined Capital One-Discover company.

While the company doesn't design and manufacture its AI chips, it helps turn these items into ready-to-use computers and servers for its data center customers. "", ""But while Super Micro's business is booming, has its explosive rally put shares outside reach for value-conscious investors? Let's dig deeper to find out whether this stock is still a good long-term buy. "", 'Historically, Super Micro has been a relatively cheap company. At the start of 2023, its shares were worth just under 10 times earnings, which was a dramatic discount to the S&P 500 average of around 27. ', ""The discount probably had a lot to do with Super Micro's business model. Unlike many of the largest technology companies, it doesn't specialize in software -- which tends to attract premium valuations because of its high margin and scalability. The company also doesn't design and manufacture high-priced chips as Nvidia or AMD do. Instead, it turns these cutting-edge products into computer servers that data center customers use to run websites, AI algorithms, and other applications. "", ""Super Micro is benefiting from soaring demand for AI-related data center hardware. Fiscal second-quarter sales jumped by 103% year over year to $3.66 billion while net income increased a much more modest 68% to $296 million. But it's unclear how much steam the rally has left. "", 'Some analysts are still optimistic about Super Micro, with Rosenblatt securities giving it a 12-month price target of $1,300, a potential 81% upside, based on projected increases in AI-related demand. But there are some reasons investors might want to stay cautious. ', ""For starters, Super Micro doesn't have a particularly deep economic moat. According to the Financial Times, many of the largest data center operators, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, can build their own computer servers. That means Super Micro's products have limited pricing power and demand inelasticity. In other words, if prices for its servers get too high, consumers may seek out alternatives. "", ""And unlike Nvidia, which saw its gross margin rise from 54% to 74% year over year in the third quarter, Super Micro's explosive top-line growth isn't improving its pricing power. "", ""The server maker's gross margin fell from 18.7% to 15.4% in its most recent earnings report. And as supplies from chipmakers like Nvidia become more expensive, Super Micro may struggle to pass on all these costs to final consumers, leading to continued margin weakness. "", ""After its rocket-ship rally, Super Micro Computer now has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 62, which is a significant premium over both the S&P 500's average of 27 and Nvidia, which trades for just 34 times its forward earnings. These numbers suggest Super Micro is overvalued."", ""Nvidia's stronger economic moat and higher margins mean its bottom line will probably grow much faster than the smaller alternative. "", 'Over the next five years, Super Micro can continue to beat the market, simply based on the momentum of the fast-growing AI industry. But right now, the stock is priced for perfection. And it will need to justify its valuation or face a correction. Investors may want to take profits or hold off buying shares until more information becomes available. ', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine NVIDIA’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' See our latest analysis for NVIDIA ', ""NVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that NVIDIA’s ratio of 65.18x is above its peer average of 30.93x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing NVIDIA at this point in time. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for NVIDIA you should be aware of."", 'If you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip emigration situation and its trends globally, and how immigration has contributed substantially to the U.S. economy, you can go directly to 5 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain.', 'Youth brain drain in the world, especially the Western Balkan Six countries (WB6) poses a significant challenge, with high rates of emigration affecting their economic and democratic advancement, potentially impacting their integration into the EU. Current strategies for addressing youth emigration focus on broader policy areas like youth employment and education but may not fully address the issue.', ""Conversely, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a substantial migration from Russia to Kazakhstan has created an opportunity for economic growth and brain gain in Kazakhstan. However, cautious policymaking in Kazakhstan could hinder capitalizing on this potential influx."", ""In the global context, attracting and retaining specialized talent is paramount for economic growth. Recent immigration policy changes, such as Ireland's expanded employment permits and the EU Blue Card enhancements, demonstrate efforts to facilitate foreign national movement. The introduction of remote work visas and visa waivers by various countries further showcases a concerted effort to attract and accommodate foreign talent, underscoring the strategic measures in place to address the complex issue of brain drain on an international level."", 'U.S. has been a focal point in context of emigration. In 2022, the workforce in the United States consisted of approximately 28.4 million immigrant employees, showcasing a notable increase of nearly 7 million from the 21.5 million recorded in 2010. Comparatively, there were approximately 129.4 million native-born workers in the same year. Among the various industries, the educational and health services sector employed the highest number of immigrant workers, totalling 5.2 million individuals, which accounted for 18.2% of all foreign-born employees.', 'This was followed by professional and business services with 4.3 million workers (15.2%) and construction with 3.3 million workers (11.7%). Notably, the construction industry boasted the largest proportion of immigrant workers in 2022, with an estimated 3.33 million individuals, representing 11.7% of all immigrant employment. Comparatively, 8.05 million native-born workers were employed in construction, constituting 6.2% of the native-born workforce.', 'A significant proportion of immigrant workers, accounting for 22.8% of the workforce, were engaged in the services sector. This category spanned various occupations, including automotive repair, barber and beauty salons, and religious organizations. Additionally, immigrant workers comprised 21.3% of the professional and business services sector in 2022, encompassing occupations in legal services, accounting, and veterinary services. Within the agricultural sector, approximately 468,000 immigrants were employed, representing 1.7% of the total immigrant workforce. In contrast, native-born individuals accounted for a larger presence in agriculture, with 1.82 million workers in 2022, comprising 1.4% of the native-born employed workforce.', 'Also, immigrant entrepreneurs have been integral to America\'s economic success story, with many of the country\'s largest and most renowned companies tracing their origins back to immigrants or their descendants. These ""New American"" businesses, ranging from well-known brands like Apple and Costco to newcomers on the Fortune 500 list such as Coupang and Lululemon, have consistently fueled innovation and growth in diverse industries. Recent analyses have shown that a significant percentage of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant or immigrant-descended founders, underscoring the enduring impact and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants in shaping the business landscape of the United States. Namely, Apple Inc. (NASDAQGS:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQGS:AMZN) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are few companies consisting of immigrant-descended founders. Before we move to our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, let’s take a look at these companies one by one.', ""The existence of the American computer company Apple Inc. (NASDAQGS:AAPL) can be directly attributed to the immigration of Steve Jobs' father, Abdul Fattah Jandali, as a political migrant from Homs, Syria. By allowing this Syrian refugee into the U.S., a pivotal pathway was created for the establishment of Apple, influencing the technology landscape significantly."", 'As of now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQGS:AAPL) stands with a market capitalization of $2.82 trillion. More so, Apple unveiled its fiscal 2024 first-quarter financial outcomes concluding on December 30, 2023. The company reported a quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, reflecting a 2% increase compared to the previous year, along with quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.18, representing a 16% surge year over year. This underscores the profound impact that immigration has had on shaping the tech industry.', 'Moreover, the Cuban immigrant background of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQGS:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos further exemplifies how the origins of influential U.S. companies are intricately connected to immigrant contributions. Currently, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQGS:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.82 trillion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Amazon’s net sales surged by 14% to reach $170.0 billion, displaying notable growth from the $149.2 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was a small soap and candle company founded by the English Immigrant William Colgate in New York City in the early 19th century. Now, it has a market capitalization of $71 billion. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) manufactures and sells consumer products in the United States and internationally. In the upcoming fiscal year of 2024, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is anticipated to report earnings of $3.47 per share on revenues totaling $20.02 billion, reflecting a 7.43% variance in earnings per share and a 2.9% shift in revenue. Projections for the following fiscal year indicate an expected increase in performance, with the company projected to earn $3.75 per share on revenues of $21.02 billion, signifying year-over-year changes of 8.03% and 5%, respectively.', 'Humannet/Shutterstock.com', 'To create our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, we referred to Fragile States Index, particularly focusing on the Human Flight and Brain Drain Index, which is capped at 10, where higher the index (closer to 10), higher the rate of brain drain in a country i.e. higher the number of skilled workers leaving the country.

The country's bankruptcy in the recent past hasn't helped the situation."", 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.6', ""Fiji is currently grappling with a significant brain drain crisis, with approximately 22,000 individuals having relocated abroad, with 16,000 departing on work permits.

The outlook for 2023-2024 poses risks concerning the electoral schedule and stricter financial conditions. The increased cost of financing, especially given Mali's high financing requirements, presents a notable risk. Tighter monetary policies have led to higher yields on Treasury bills and bonds within the WAEMU region."", 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.7 ', ""Despite facing the challenge of brain drain, Grenada's economy shows resilience and growth, with expectations to exceed pre-pandemic levels by 2023. The growth is propelled by the construction sector's strong performance and a steady rise in tourist arrivals, supported by successful initiatives to enhance airlift connectivity."", 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8', 'Syria is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with more than two-thirds of the population in acute need of assistance. The combination of factors such as the global economic recession, the impact of COVID-19, sanctions, and economic challenges in neighboring Lebanon has led to over 90% of the population living below the poverty line. The erosion of purchasing power, high inflation rates, and currency depreciation have further exacerbated the economic hardships faced by Syrians. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has impacted the cost of staple foods, leading to increased food insecurity in the country.', 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8', '14th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain is Cabo Verde, which is facing a significant brain drain issue, with more of its population residing outside the country than within its borders. However, since 2019, the Cape Verdean government has initiated a new digital plan to establish the country as a prominent tech hub in the sub-region, aiming to compete with tech powerhouses like Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa. This strategic plan seeks to address the brain drain challenge and propel Cabo Verde as a key player in the tech industry through innovative initiatives and investments.', 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.1', ""13th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain is Moldova, which is facing a significant brain drain issue, as many young individuals have been compelled to seek opportunities abroad due to limited job prospects and low wages at home. Various global and regional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have exacerbated the economic challenges in the country. The departure of talented young Moldovans has resulted in a shortage of skilled workforce needed for economic reconstruction, posing risks to local industries' competitiveness and growth. Moldova has experienced a significant loss of its student population over the past 16 years, further intensifying the brain drain phenomenon."", 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.2', ""Guyana has been grappling with a significant brain drain issue, leading to an exodus of highly skilled individuals seeking better opportunities and higher pay abroad. The departure of skilled professionals has resulted in shortages in critical sectors like healthcare, education, and technology, leading to a decline in service quality and innovation. Reports indicate that a large percentage of individuals with tertiary education have left the country for more lucrative jobs. The World Bank's 2021 report highlights the need for Guyana to address the lack of opportunities and low pay for skilled professionals in order to retain talent and combat brain drain."", 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.3', ""Haiti is the 11th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, as it is experiencing ongoing emigration, fueled by historical challenges such as poverty, natural disasters, political crises, and insecurity. The country's struggles, including a massive earthquake in 2010, violent riots in 2018, and the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, have contributed to a power vacuum and increased migration. Economic instability, exacerbated by widespread poverty, has further driven Haitians to seek opportunities abroad."", 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.4', 'A significant number of young Micronesians have been leaving their country in pursuit of better economic prospects, which are limited in the Federated States of Micronesia. President David Panuelo highlighted this issue in his state of the nation address, revealing that over 2,000 citizens migrated permanently in 2020, followed by another 2,500 in 2021. The trend shows a disproportionate loss of youth, with the average age of emigrating citizens ranging between 25 and 28, posing a challenge for the nation.', 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.5', 'The Taliban have appealed to Western nations to halt the evacuation and resettlement of educated and skilled Afghans abroad, stating it is detrimental to Afghanistan. They claim improved security within the country, assuring the safety and freedom of all Afghans, including those affiliated with the previous government. Despite this, tens of thousands of educated Afghans have fled in fear of Taliban persecution in the past two years, prompting countries like the United States, Canada, and various European nations to accept Afghan refugees. This significant brain drain, including media professionals, has resulted in setbacks for free media in Afghanistan.', 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.5 ', 'Albania has been grappling with a significant brain drain issue, ranking among the top countries globally for emigration prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite being the only non-African country in this top tier, Albania has faced a resurgence in emigration over the past decade, affecting its population and educational system. This brain drain has led to a workforce crisis in various industries and sectors within the country.', 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.6', 'Somalia, 7th on our list of Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, continues to face challenges with brain drain as the number of diaspora academic returnees remains lower than desired. Despite an increase in the return of diaspora academics each year, the country still experiences a net loss of people according to World Bank migration data. The shortage of qualified and experienced academic staff in higher education institutions further exacerbates the brain drain issue in Somalia.', 'Human Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.6', ""The prolonged conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia has resulted in significant loss of life and instability in the region.

GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements.

These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.', 'We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’ operating performance. The constant currency revenue and adjusted revenue growth measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and exclude discontinued operations, while adjusted revenue growth also excludes revenue from Corporate and Other, giving investors further insight into our performance. Finally, free cash flow provides further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.', 'Constant currency revenue represents reported segment revenue excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.', 'Adjusted revenue growth reflects the percentage change in constant currency revenue for the current period as compared to the prior period.

This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K."", 'Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue.', 'Adjusted net earnings excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. These include, among others, the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization which is recurring.', 'Adjusted EPS reflects adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.', 'Free cash flow reflects net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and excluding certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow as presented in this earnings release includes cash flow from discontinued operations, which our management will not be able to freely access following the Worldpay separation.', 'Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.

CEO Marc Benioff might be a big believer in stakeholder capitalism, but 2023 proved that even he wouldn’t stand for an excessive work force.', 'Perhaps the problem was that the U.S. created too many jobs in 2022. Approximately 4.5 million were added, the second-highest in 40 years. An increase like that may have been the deciding factor forcing firms like Salesforce to dial back on operating expenses.', 'In mid-February 2024, Nike (NYSE:NKE) announced it was cutting 1,700 people from its workforce, 2% overall. “The actions that we’re taking put us in the position to right-size our organization to get after our biggest growth opportunities,” CNN Business reported Nike’s comments in a company statement.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'It appears 2024 will be no different than 2023: full of job cuts and rightsizing.

Fidelity National Information Services will retain a 45% interest. FIS plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt and buyback $3 billion of its stock in 2024.', 'The sale gave Worldpay an enterprise value of $18.5 billion, less than half the $43 billion it paid for it in 2019.

It took a $500 million hit for ending contract manufacturing.', 'My suspicion is that Moderna is waiting to see how the first half of 2024 goes before it looks to make any headcount reductions or layoffs.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase McDonald's' shares on or after the 29th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.67 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.68 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, McDonald's stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of US$297.75. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", "" See our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. McDonald's paid out 54% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 62% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's positive to see that McDonald's's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at McDonald's, with earnings per share up 9.0% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, McDonald's has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.0% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid McDonald's? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and McDonald's paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy McDonald's today."", ""If you want to look further into McDonald's, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces.

""We remain confident in the resilience of our business amid macro challenges that will persist in 2024,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors in mid-February.', ""You'll pay a premium for McDonald's over PepsiCo and some other passive-income stocks, to be sure.

Prologis (NYSE: PLD) is no different from any other REIT in this regard, though it tends to be afforded a premium valuation much of the time. So its 2.6% dividend yield might seem a bit miserly -- until you find out that the dividend has grown at an annualized clip of more than 10% over the past decade. That's very attractive. And, given the REIT's $40 billion secret weapon, more robust dividend growth is likely in the years ahead. Here's what you need to know."", 'Prologis has a market cap of around $120 billion. That is a huge figure for a REIT and makes this company one of the largest players in the broader REIT sector. However, Prologis is a very focused company. It owns around 5,500 warehouses. Looking at this from a different perspective, the REIT manages assets with over 1.2 billion square feet of rentable space.', ""That's just the start, however, because its portfolio isn't just in one country -- it is spread around the world. North America, South America, Europe, and Asia are all covered, with properties in around 20 countries. All the assets Prologis owns are in important transportation hubs, which means demand is pretty strong for its properties. Better yet, with such a broadly diversified footprint, Prologis can offer its more than 6,700 customers a single business contact for multiple, geographically diverse locations."", ""This REIT is an entrenched giant in the warehouse sector, and it would be very difficult to unseat it. But there's one more subtle factor here that investors should keep in mind, even though it often gets overlooked. Prologis has a $40 billion investment opportunity built right into its portfolio."", 'The REIT model is pretty simple. REITs own large physical assets and rent them out to customers. But how does one grow a REIT? The answer is just as simple: You increase the number of assets the REIT owns. There are really just two ways to do this.', ""The first, and most obvious, way to increase the size of a REIT's portfolio is to buy additional properties. That can happen on a one-off basis, through portfolio size transactions, or via the acquisition of a competitor. Prologis does all three."", ""The second way to grow the portfolio would be to build new assets from the ground up. This is a longer process and has to start with owning land on which the REIT can build something. That's the key here. Prologis owns or controls around 8,000 acres of land in North America, over 2,200 acres in Europe, nearly 1,800 acres in South America, and about 100 acres in Asia. Most of this property is near assets the REIT already operates, so the land is well located and will easily slide right into the operating asset base."", ""While it would take years for Prologis to build on all of that land, that's actually a net positive. It means that the REIT has years of growth already built into its portfolio. Management estimates that this is a $40 billion opportunity. But step back for a second and consider how big that really is by comparing it to the REIT's $120 billion market cap. This is a very big secret weapon and one to which investors should be paying a lot of attention."", ""Given Prologis' 2.6% dividend yield, it probably won't be of interest to investors looking to maximize the income their portfolios generate. But the rapid dividend growth, and the $40 billion opportunity to build on vacant land it already owns, suggest that growth and income investors should probably take a closer look at this industry giant."", 'In the end, if you own the stock for long enough, a fast-growing dividend can provide more income than a slow-growing dividend. Prologis is the kind of company that long-term investors could learn to love more and more every year, even if they have a penchant for larger upfront income streams.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Prologis wasn’t one of them.

One year ago, shares traded for roughly the same price they trade at today.', 'In 2024, Occidental stock could finally take off. Under the hood, the financials remain strong. A big catalyst toward the end of the year could add significant value. And with climate change a growing concern among major institutional investors, Occidental stands to take attention away from its competition for years to come.', 'Exactly how much upside could there be in 2024?', 'The biggest advantage Occidental has right now is ample free cash flow to direct toward whatever action will accrue the most long-term shareholder wealth.', ""In the third quarter alone, Occidental produced $1.7 billion in free cash flow. It used $600 million of this extra cash to repurchase common stock, with another $342 million dedicated to redeeming preferred shares. That still left more than $700 million for capital expenses and debt reduction, with the remainder padding the company's cash pile."", ""This tremendous cash flow is not an accident. For years the company has focused on relatively high margin properties. Occidental's production portfolio currently has a breakeven of under $50 per barrel, well below its peer average . On a corporate level, its wells have an average decline in production per year somewhere between 20% and 25%. That's high for oil producers in general, but roughly in-line with other shale producers."", 'Despite high free-cash-flow levels, share price weakness has left Occidental stock with an attractive free-cash-flow yield. Right now, for every $100 invested in the stock, shareholders are accruing roughly $10 in free cash flow every year. That figure has declined in recent quarters, but should get a big bump in the second half of 2024.', ""In December, Occidental agreed to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion. CrownRock owns shale assets in the Permian basin, a region Occidental knows well. CrownRock's assets already produce oil and gas, meaning it won't be long before Occidental begins to earn a return on its investment. In the first year, management believes the acquisition will add around $1 billion to its free-cash-flow generation."", ""The deal is not without risk. CrownRock's breakeven is currently between $50 and $60 per barrel. With oil prices around $80 per barrel, that's not an issue right now. Should oil prices head lower, however, Occidental could be left with unprofitable assets. More than half of Occidental's current production, for comparison, can still be profitable even with oil prices below $50 per barrel. It should also be noted that the acquisition of CrownRock would increase Occidental's average well decline rate. CrowdRock's 35% average well decline rate is relatively attractive versus other properties targeting similar areas, but it is still a steep curve compared to more conventional plays."", 'The acquisition was also recently delayed after the FTC requested additional information from Occidental. Still, management believes the purchase will close by the second half of 2024. As long as oil prices remain at or above current levels, Occidental will only add to its free-cash-flow generation. It can use that money to buy back more stock, raise the dividend, or invest in emerging growth opportunities like carbon capture.', 'Money manager BlackRock controls more than $9 trillion in assets. The market listens closely whenever its CEO, Larry Fink, offers his opinion. In 2020, Fink warned other CEOs that climate change will be ""a defining factor in companies\' long-term prospects.""', ""This wasn't a matter of philosophy for Fink, but a matter of money. Companies that ignore climate change, he believed, will face a gradual decline in investor interest, raising the cost to do business."", ""Oil companies have been in the spotlight following Fink's letter. In the past, stocks like Occidental might have traded at much higher valuations given the ample free-cash-flow generation. Today, however, investor appetite for fossil fuel producers is relatively lower. That's why Occidental is investing in another business that could propel its growth for decades to come. That business is carbon capture."", ""Whenever oil or gas is burned, the result is atmospheric carbon, the major contributor to climate change. But what if oil and gas producers like Occidental sequestered this carbon back into the ground? Instead of an oil and gas producer, the company would become a carbon management business. That's exactly what Occidental is aiming to become."", ""The transition won't be easy, nor cheap, but there are some reasons to believe it's possible. Putting carbon into the ground uses much of the same infrastructure as extracting it. Occidental already has many of the assets needed to sequester carbon, yet it still requires a way to gather the carbon for sequestration. That is why it initiated two pilot projects seeking to capture carbon onsite directly through the air, a process called direct air capture, or DAC. DAC is currently not economically viable, but proponents believe costs will continue to fall as the technology scales and improves ."", ""If successful, Occidental's DAC projects could position the company as a top choice for energy investors seeking to hedge their regulatory and social risk. While expensive, DAC sequestration has the advantage of being long lasting. Sequestering carbon in a forest only lasts for as long as the forest remains. Carbon captured in the air and sequestered deep in the ground, however, is nearly permanent. With integrated carbon sequestration capabilities that produce long lasting results, Occidental can arguably attract more investor interest in a future where markets grow worried about fossil fuel producers with unmitigated externalities."", ""Occidental's carbon capture business will take years to build out. But with high levels of current and expected free cash flow, shares should have limited downside while the carbon capture business attempts to scale."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

His Berkshire Hathaway portfolio boasts a market-beating long-term track record, after all. And he's managed to beat the market with a simple buy-and-hold approach rather than constantly swapping out existing holdings for hotter prospects."", ""Just because a stock is currently in Berkshire's portfolio, however, doesn't mean it's a great pick for you to purchase at this time."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at two Warren Buffett stocks most investors can plow into right now, and one you might want to steer clear of -- at least for the time being."", ""If you're looking for excitement, pass on Berkshire Hathaway holding Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). It doesn't offer it."", ""But if you're looking for reliable and consistent results, Bank of America is for you."", ""The company doesn't need too much of an introduction. It's the nation's second-biggest banking name, with $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its books. Like most of its peers, it provides basic banking services like checking accounts and loans, as well as a variety of investment and wealth-management services. Also like most of the country's bigger banks, Bank of America works with corporations to help them raise capital. It's not a particularly complicated business, and it's not as if one of these entities enjoys a hyper-competitive edge."", 'And yet, Bank of America is clearly something of a standout within the banking industry. It managed to add 130,000 new consumer checking accounts last quarter, and brought in 40,000 new brokerage and private-banking customers. Investment banking fee revenue improved 7% year over year despite the worldwide lull in capital markets activity. Its capital ratios and equity ratios are holding up pretty well, too, despite the wobbly economic environment.', ""Perhaps the only worry in last quarter's numbers is the uptick in loan charge-offs, but even this growth was only slight. A mere 0.45% of the bank's total loan portfolio was written off last quarter, versus 0.35% a quarter earlier and 0.26% in the same quarter a year earlier. That's more than manageable."", ""The point is, even if it is less than exciting, this is a solid company in a business that's never going to go away. The stock is currently sporting a dividend yield of 2.8%, paying shareholders for their patience."", ""Bank of America is Berkshire's second-biggest holding, by the way. Its 1.03 million shares are worth a total of $35 billion."", ""Just when you think Buffett can't possibly want to own even more of a particular organization, he buys more. Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of 19.6 million shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) in the fourth quarter of last year brings Berkshire's tally up to 243.7 million shares. The whole stake is worth $14.5 billion, or roughly one-fourth of the oil and gas company's market cap."", ""It was a somewhat curious pick when Berkshire first established the position back in 2019. While Occidental is a fine company as far as energy stocks go, it's not been a sector Buffett has seemingly been interested in for quite some time. That may have something to do with the fact that environmental concerns are slowly but surely working against traditional oil and gas companies. In this vein, the advent of renewable energy sources and the threat they pose to hydrocarbons may play a role in that relative disinterest as well."", ""However, as time marches on, it's becoming increasingly clear that oil and natural gas are going to be needed for a long, long while. The International Energy Agency believes global consumption of oil, natural gas, and even coal will actually continue growing through 2030. Once reaching that peak six years down the road, demand will gradually fall all the way to 2050."", ""Translation: There's still plenty of money to be made within this sector."", 'There are also plenty of stocks to choose from as a means of capitalizing on this persistent demand. Of all these options, Occidental is arguably one of the best. Under the leadership of Vicki Hollub, the company seems to have a confident grip on which assets are worth investing in, and which are worth letting go.', 'For instance, Occidental Petroleum is rumored to be working toward a sale of its natural gas pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners in order to pay down debt, but at the same time is acquiring CrownRock in an effort to expand its onshore operations in the Permian Basin. This kind of asset optimization ultimately sets the stage for wider profit margins.', 'At the other end of the spectrum, Buffett fans might want to hold off on any new positions in Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) until the dust settles. The dust in question, of course, is the recent announcement that Capital One is making a $35 billion bid to acquire rival credit card company Discover Financial Services.', ""On the surface it seems like a reasonably good fit. The two organizations' target markets and strategies are more similar than not. And there's little doubt that this team-up could prove a true competitive threat to credit card powerhouses Visa and Mastercard. Discover even manages its own payments network (albeit a smaller one than Visa or Mastercard) that could eventually handle Capital One cards as well."", ""There's a reason, however, that Capital One Financial shares didn't budge following Monday's announcement of the bid. Two reasons, actually."", ""One of these reasons is that while the strategic thinking behind the acquisition makes enough superficial sense, investors may not be entirely convinced the $35 billion price of the all-stock deal is worth it. Discover's 2023 net income of just under $3 billion on revenue of $16 billion is respectable to be sure. But Capital One is looking to pay a premium price for a company with a wobbly asset base and growing delinquencies and charge-offs."", ""The other reason the market didn't respond all that bullishly to the news is that the deal may not close. The U.S. Justice Department must first approve the pairing, and it's been particularly wary of mergers within the banking sector lately. Green-lighting the acquisition won't necessarily push Capital One shares higher, yet forbidding the deal could potentially upend the stock."", ""There's also the not-so-minor reality that integrating two companies, each with their own well-defined structures and custom-designed tech, often turns out to be more complicated than initially expected."", ""The simple solution for interested investors?

The move could make Capital One the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. and create greater competition for Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), whose stocks fell following the news announcement. Here's what it could mean for investors in those companies."", ""Capital One provides its customers with various financial and banking services and is the ninth-largest bank in the U.S. The company's bread-and-butter business is issuing branded cards through Visa and Mastercard. It's the fourth-largest card issuer in the U.S., according to The Nilson Report."", 'This deal is turning a lot of heads, and for good reason. Capital One issues debit and credit cards through Mastercard and Visa, with its transactions running through their networks and earning them fees on every swipe. Meanwhile, Capital One holds on to this credit card debt and services these loans. The merger could make Capital One the largest credit card lender in the U.S., pushing it ahead of JPMorgan Chase, which currently holds that title.', ""In addition, it would provide Capital One with Discover's payment networks, including Discover Network, Diners Club, and Pulse debit network, which have struggled to compete with Visa and Mastercard for payment volume. If the deal goes through, Capital One could move its cards to Discover's network and create a closed-loop payment network that better competes with Visa and Mastercard."", 'This is where things get interesting with regulators. On the one hand, they have expressed concern about Capital One being the largest card issuer in the U.S. On the other hand, those same regulators want more competition from different payment networks to better contend with Visa and Mastercard, who they claim have a duopoly over payment processing.', ""According to data from The Nilson Report, Visa processed $11.6 trillion in payment volume in 2022, while Mastercard had $6.6 trillion. American Express had $1.5 trillion. In comparison, Discover's networks processed $243 billion, or only 2% of Visa's payment volume."", ""According to analysts with Morgan Stanley, Capital One's existing debit card portfolio is primarily Mastercard-branded, where it does about $100 billion in volume annually. In addition, it has about $75 billion in credit card volume between Visa and Mastercard."", ""Those analysts say that if Capital One were to move its volumes over to Discover, it would have a 0.2% effect on Visa and a 2.1% effect on Mastercard's payment volume. Any effect on Visa's or Mastercard's bottom line would likely be negligible."", 'Before the Capital One-Discover deal can go through, it must face heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and consumer groups. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that the merger ""threatens our financial stability, reduces competition, and would increase fees and credit costs for American families,"" and asked regulators to ""block it immediately.""', 'In addition, Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said, ""This merger will create a new juggernaut in the credit card market, with unprecedented powers to extort American consumers. That cannot be allowed to happen."" With opposition from both sides of the aisle, the deal will likely face significant headwinds before any approval.', ""The Capital One-Discover deal would be the fifth-largest bank merger in U.S. history. If it goes through, Visa and Mastercard would certainly feel some effects, although it wouldn't put too big a dent in their earnings. However, the deal has significant hurdles to overcome and its approval could hinge on election results in November, so a decision likely won't be made until later this year or 2025."", ""Investors should continue to monitor this deal. It could create an intriguing investment opportunity in the combined Capital One-Discover company.

But the more I deliberated, the less comfortable I was choosing one of those stocks.', ""Don't get me wrong. I like (and own) several great AI stocks. However, I could easily name downsides to all of them. So which stock do I think is the ultimate pick to buy with $1,000 right now? After careful consideration, my answer is... Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)."", 'The song ""Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive"" became popular decades before I was born. It came to mind, though, as I mentally reviewed multiple ultimate growth stock contenders. Vertex has plenty of positives to accentuate.', 'This big biopharmaceutical company is highly profitable. Vertex generated earnings of over $3.6 billion last year on revenue of close to $9.9 billion. It also has a big cash stockpile totaling $13.7 billion.', ""Vertex doesn't just have one or two paths to growth; it has at least half a dozen. The one that's front and center right now is the company's cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise. The company's four approved CF drugs have been the source of its success so far. Vertex plans to file for approval this summer for a triple-drug combo that will likely become its most profitable CF therapy yet."", 'Meanwhile, the big biotech already has its first non-CF therapy on the market. Casgevy won regulatory approvals in recent months in treating (actually, curing) two rare blood disorders, sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy could reach peak annual sales of $3.9 billion, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.', ""Look for another regulatory filing in mid-2024, too. Vertex's pain drug VX-548 could have tremendous commercial potential. It effectively alleviates acute pain but without the nasty side effects and addictive qualities of opioid drugs. The company is also evaluating VX-548 in a pivotal clinical study targeting peripheral neuropathic pain."", 'Inaxaplin could be another huge winner. The experimental drug is advancing into late-stage testing in the first quarter of this year. Inaxaplin targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD), a disease that affects more patients worldwide than CF. If approved, inaxaplin would be the only therapy on the market that treats the underlying cause of AMKD.', 'Those are the high-probability growth drivers for Vertex. The company also has promising pipeline programs that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes and treat myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a type of muscular dystrophy.', 'There\'s also a line in that old song that it\'s good to ""e-lim-i-nate the negative.""

Further, it would be highly disruptive to our operations, our workers, and the North American supply chain to replace a majority of our well-functioning board, which we have refreshed in a thoughtful and intentional manner over the last several years in order to adopt Ancora\'s short-sighted strategy.

This includes new technology, enhanced training and additional staffing, as well as adjustments to network design and train assembly procedures. Today, the company's mainline accident rate is the lowest it has been in years and is among the best of the US Class 1 rails. These investments and operational advancements have meaningfully improved the company's safety performance and service product in both its intermodal and merchandise networks. The company has fundamentally transformed its processes to reaffirm the trust of its customers, establish confidence with communities, and regain the trust of regulators to position it for sustainability and success in 2024 and beyond."", ""Today, under Shaw's leadership, Norfolk Southern's plan is focused on three pillars: safely delivering reliable and resilient service, driving continuous efficiency improvement, and propelling smart and sustainable growth. The company's goal is to create a more resilient railroad with a compelling service product to outperform throughout market cycles. As part of that effort, the company is building a more fluid network positioned to take on additional volume and better serve customers so it can deliver on its commitments of top-tier earnings and revenue growth with industry-competitive margins and disciplined capital allocation. Through its scheduled operating model, the company will drive productivity through its network that will result in meaningful annual margin improvements and drive long-term shareholder value."", 'By executing on its strategic vision, Norfolk Southern deployed new initiatives in 2023, and as a result delivered numerous notable operational achievements, including:', 'Providing its best\xa0intermodal service in over three years in the fourth quarter of 2023 and growing intermodal volume by 5% on a year-over-year basis;', 'Achieving industry-leading safety results, notably a 42% reduction in mainline accident rate in 2023 and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999;', 'Improving terminal dwell time and manifest train speed year-over-year; and', 'Completing over $1 billion in comprehensive infrastructure improvement projects throughout its 22-state network to further enhance safety and efficiency.', ""While 2023 presented several significant challenges to service and financial performance, the company has navigated those challenges and responsibly enhanced service, safety, and growth to protect the franchise and shareholders. Now, in 2024, Norfolk Southern is positioned to advance the scheduled railroading operating principles in its merchandise network that have driven productivity improvements in its intermodal network. By doing so, Norfolk Southern expects to reduce variability, complexity, and cost. At the same time, the management team has been conducting a full portfolio review of the company's intermodal franchise to identify opportunities to further simplify and accelerate the network, ultimately contributing to improving operating margins."", ""Recklessly chasing cost reduction at the expense of safety and service is not a winning strategy for creating sustainable shareholder value. Norfolk Southern's customers, regulators and employees have made it very clear – they will not tolerate service declines and safety lapses in pursuit of extreme near-term cost reductions. As articulated by key regulators, the approach Ancora has outlined, given the track record of certain of its board and management candidates, should be a serious cause for concern among all stakeholders who support the long-term growth and sustainability of the rail industry."", 'Proven commitment to board refreshment', ""As noted in the preliminary proxy materials, the board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote on the WHITE card only for its slate of 13 directors. The Norfolk Southern Board has maintained an ongoing process of refreshment, with six directors appointed to the board in the past five years. In July 2023, Admiral Philip Davidson, U.S. Navy (Ret.) and Francesca DeBiase were added to the board as independent directors, providing significant and immediate contributions to the board's work on safety and risk oversight, as well as operations and logistics expertise.

(NYSE:KO) has been growing nicely despite moderate unit volume gains, led by price increases. However, as consumers start to show price increase fatigue, volume growth should come more into play in the future.', 'Coca-Cola owns a number of beverage brands in the soft drink, sports drink, energy drink, water, coffee, tea and juice categories. Its brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade, Dasani, Vitaminwater, Costa and Minute Maid, among others.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ABNB.', ""The company's products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. It sells its concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners, as well as finished products to wholesalers, distirbutors and retailers."", ""Coca-Cola has long been one of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s and Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) largest holdings, most recently representing about 6.80% of the insurance giant's investment portfolio. The guru originally bought the stock back in 1988 and has held on ever since."", 'So what made Coca-Cola attractive to Buffett and other investors? First and foremost, the Coke brand is one of the most recognizable brands around the globe. It is the clear leader in the soft drink category with five of the top six global soft drink brands in the world. Brands are valuable, and there are not many as big as Coca-Cola in the food and beverage space.', 'While overall global unit case volume growth has been modest, up only 2% in 2023 after 5% growth in 2022, what the company has shown is a lot of pricing power. Price and mix accounted for 10% growth in 2023 and 11% in 2022. As a result, Coca-Cola has seen strong organic revenue growth the past two years of 16% and 12%. It is looking for 6% to 7% organic growth in 2024.', 'Latin America has been an area of particular strength for the company in recent years, with unit case volumes up 6% in 2022 and 5% in 2023, and concentrate sales up 7% in 2022 and 6% in 2023. This strength continued in the fourth quarter of 2023, with unit case volumes up 4% and concentrate sales up 10%.', 'Coca-Cola will also look to boost sales through its first new permanent soft drink flavor in quite some time. Over the past several years, it has offered some limited-edition flavors, but it recently announced Coca-Cola Spiced will become a permeant addition to its soft-drink roster to help connect with younger consumers whose tastes have shifted from older generations.', 'The company is also in the process of refranchising its company-owned bottling operations. The goal is to not only get cash for the deals, but to have it boost margins as well. Soda makers seem to go through phases of vertical integration and then selling off their company-owned bottlers. Coca-Cola is in the selling off phase at the moment.', ""According to Bloomberg, the company is also eyeing its first big acquisition in years, looking to acquire healthy soda brand Poppi. The upstart beverage company recently turned heads with its first Superbowl advertisement claiming that soda will no longer be considered a dirty word. Coca-Cola has a strong track record with acquisitions, and if it acquires the company, would likely be able to accelerate the brand's growth given its huge distribution network."", 'When it comes to risks, soda has certainly lost some share over the years to other beverage categories, including energy drinks and sparkling water. Soda has become linked to health issues, even diet versions, which has changed drinking habits in places like the U.S. and other areas, especially with younger generations. This should be a continued headwind in more developed markets.', ""Meanwhile, Coca-Cola has taken a lot of price over the past few years. While it has shown pricing power, it may not be able to continue to increase prices at the same rate going forward. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for example, has said it is seeing some backlash from its customers over prices. All in all, it seems consumers are getting fed up with the rate of price increases throughout the consumer staple space."", ""Coca-Cola's stock currently trades at 17.40 times the 2024 consensus Ebitda of $15.28 billion and 16.30 times the 2025 consensus of $16.30 billion."", 'It trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21 based on the 2024 consensus of $2.81 and nearly 20 times the 2025 consensus of $3.01.', 'It is projected to grow revenue by 0.40% this year and 4.90% in 2025. Its bottler refranchising will cut into revenue in 2024, which is why its organic revenue growth is projected to be higher.', 'Coca-Cola trades at premium to its two soda peers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP), despite expected slower revenue growth.', 'Historically, over the last several years, it has traded between 17 and 22 times enterprise value/Ebitda. That would place a fair value on the stock based on 2025 Ebitda of between $62 and $81, with a midpoint of $71.50.', 'Coca-Cola has put together some solid revenue growth the past three years coming out of the pandemic. However, with consumers starting to push back on prices caused by high inflation, volume will likely start to come more into play over the new few years.', 'The company will likely continue to carry a premium valuation given its brand power, but the growth of the past few years should start to slow down in the coming years. This could lead it to trade closer to the lower end of its recent historical multiple range.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Dividend stocks are especially attractive options because you can choose to reinvest your quarterly payouts automatically rather than taking the cash. You'll accumulate more shares over time that way, amplifying your long-term returns."", ""The dividend stocks you pick should have excellent expansion opportunities and a good chance at boosting their earnings power over time. And ideally, they'll be market leaders that pay a generous -- and growing -- dividend."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) fits this description perfectly. Let's look at why the beverage giant is worth buying if you're considering putting some cash to work in a top dividend stock."", ""Coke is boosting sales at a healthy rate these days even while peers struggle with growth challenges. Organic sales were up 12% through the 2023 fiscal year on top of big gains a year earlier. Contrast those results with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), which expanded its beverage business by 7% in the same period, and there's a clear winner to favor right now."", ""Coke gets a lift from its industry leadership position, its focused portfolio centered around on-the-go beverages, and its market-trouncing efficiency. There's plenty of growth available outside of traditional sparkling sodas, too. Coke is winning in areas like energy drinks, teas, waters, and alcoholic drinks. It already accounts for a significant portion of all beverages consumed around the world, but there's room for that metric to improve in the years and decades to come."", ""The dividend is easily covered by Coke's rock-solid finances. Start with free cash flow, which improved to $9.7 billion this past year from $9.5 billion in 2022. Management is projecting a slightly heavier spending year in 2024 so that cash flow slips to around $9.2 billion. That's still well above the $8 billion it paid in dividends in the past 12 months."", ""Earnings trends are just as strong. Coke benefited from rising prices and higher sales volumes in 2023, allowing profit margin to edge up to 29.1% of sales from 28.7% of sales in 2022. That's about double PepsiCo's profitability and it means dividend investors have every reason to feel confident that their payout can keep rising over the coming years -- just as it has for roughly the last 60 years."", ""It's true that you'll have to pay a premium to own this top dividend stock. Coke shares are priced at 5.8 times sales, more than double PepsiCo's valuation. Yet that price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has been as high as 7 at several times in the past five years. Coke has become cheaper as Wall Street shifted its preference toward high-growth stocks in areas like tech."", 'Dividend investors should consider taking advantage of that short-term change in sentiment to pick up this stellar business. Sure, Coke is expecting sales growth to slow to between 6% and 7% this year, and its earnings will likely just expand by about 5%.', ""Yet, steady gains in both these metrics are what shareholders have come to expect from the sparkling beverage leader. Some years bring unusually strong growth, while others are more modest. But through it all, Coke tends to have no problem capitalizing on its massive competitive advantages.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2023 Waste Management had debt of US$15.9b, up from US$14.7b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$458.0m, its net debt is less, at about US$15.4b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Waste Management had liabilities of US$4.23b due within a year, and liabilities of US$21.7b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$458.0m in cash and US$2.87b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$22.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because Waste Management is worth a massive US$83.6b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', 'Waste Management has net debt to EBITDA of 2.6 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. On the plus side, its EBIT was 7.6 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 2.6. One way Waste Management could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 12%, as it did over the last year. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Waste Management can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.', ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, Waste Management produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 61% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""We feel that Waste Management's solid conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was really heart warming, like a mid-winter fair trade hot chocolate in a tasteful alpine chalet. But we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. All these things considered, it appears that Waste Management can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  Waste Management is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about..."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase LyondellBasell Industries' shares on or after the 1st of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.00 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that LyondellBasell Industries has a trailing yield of 5.0% on the current share price of US$99.27.

So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 76% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 47% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that LyondellBasell Industries's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're discomforted by LyondellBasell Industries's 12% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, LyondellBasell Industries has increased its dividend at approximately 0.5% a year on average."", ""Has LyondellBasell Industries got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. In summary, it's hard to get excited about LyondellBasell Industries from a dividend perspective."", ""So if you want to do more digging on LyondellBasell Industries, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces.

Out, for example, was Standard Rope & Twine, and in recently have been big technology companies.', 'Apple, Intel and Microsoft are some of the newer-economy names currently in the Dow.

That means stocks with big price tags often push and pull it the most, such as UnitedHealth Group and its $500 stock price. A 1% move for that stock, which is about $5, packs a much bigger punch than a 1% move for Verizon Communications, which is about 41 cents.', 'The S&P 500, meanwhile, gives more weight to stocks depending on their overall size. That means a 1% move for the most valuable company, Microsoft, packs more punch than a 1% move for any other stock, even though Microsoft’s price of $410 is below UnitedHealth’s and others.', 'WHY CARE ABOUT THE DOW?', 'Because it’s so old, it has a longer track record than other measures of the market.', 'For a while, a triple-digit move for the Dow also used to be an easy shorthand way to show the stock market was having a big day. Now, though, it means much less. A 100 point swing for the Dow means a move of just under 0.3%.']"

It's been almost four years since things got tough back in 2020, with all those travel restrictions and people losing interest in trips. But hey, experts are saying we can expect a full recovery by 2024! Last year, 2023, saw a big jump in international travel - like, 88% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, according to the UN folks. The World Travel and Tourism Council also reported that international arrival numbers were even higher than the previous year in all regions."", 'And the good news keeps coming - it looks like 2024 could see some regions surpassing 2019 levels by the end of the year! In 2023, international tourism brought in about $1.4 trillion, almost 93% of 2019 earnings. And the total revenues from tourism were estimated at $1.6 trillion, nearly 95% of the 2019 numbers. That’s a good sign of recovery, right?', 'Looking ahead, technology like AI, data analytics, VR, and AR is set to shake things up in the travel scene. We might soon be able to explore destinations virtually before booking our actual trips - how cool is that? A global survey showed that travellers in many countries are balancing budgets with luxuries. In 2024, some are even thinking about taking their kids out of school for holiday trips or borrowing fancy clothes instead of buying new ones. It seems there\'s a shift towards shorter, more luxurious vacations in Europe, with a focus on quality over quantity. And ""micro-cations"" are becoming a thing, emphasizing making the most of short stays. And hey, there’s this sneaky money-saving trick called Skiplagging, where you book hidden flights to save cash. It seems like travelers are getting more creative with their plans these days.', 'Now before we delve into our list of 25 Cheapest Countries to Fly to From the USA in 2024, let us also first analyze what’s happening around the key stakeholders of the travel industry.

They brought in a whopping $14.2 billion in operating revenue and bagged an operating income of $1.3 billion, giving them a solid operating margin of 9.3%.

Plus, their operating cash flow hit $545 million, and they put $361 million towards debt and finance lease obligations."", 'There’s some news on American Airlines involving pilot Bryan Spence, who is suing the company over ESG investment choices. Judge Reed O\'Connor allowed the lawsuit to proceed, saying the airline\'s process seemed ""sketchy"". Spence claims the airline didn\'t properly manage retirement assets with political agendas in mind. American Airlines wanted the case dismissed, but O\'Connor is letting it move forward.', ""American Airlines Group Inc. had a killer year, pulling in a record revenue of about $53 billion for the year ended 31 December 2023. In the fourth quarter alone, they raked in $19 million in GAAP net income, and for the whole year, they banked a cool $822 million. And check out those earnings per share: $0.03 for the quarter and $1.21 for the whole year. Looks like they're flying high financially!"", ""Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE: ALK) shareholders must have been stoked to see the share price go up by 12% in the past month. But hey, let's not overlook the fact that the returns haven't been all that awesome over the last three years. The share price actually took a dip by 42% during this time, falling way below the market return. Things started looking a bit brighter for shareholders last week, but they're still in the red when you look back over the past three years."", ""In the fourth quarter ending 31 December 2023, and the whole year of 2023, they reported net income of $38 million and $583 million, respectively. This translates to $0.30 and $4.53 per diluted share. Now, that's compared to the numbers from 2022, where net income hit $118 million and $556 million, or $0.92 and $4.35 per diluted share.

After that, we checked out the Travel and Tourism Development Index by the World Economic Forum.

We looked at flights from South Dakota to the capitals of those countries, with the trip lasting a month starting on March 1, 2024; the rationale behind choosing South Dakota as the departure point being the fact that it’s the closest state to the center point of USA.', ""And that's how we came up with our list of the 25 Cheapest Countries to Fly to From the USA in 2024."", 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Our Top 3 Guesses,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-secret-stock-pick-190330538.html,1708369410,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'AFL']","['Warren Buffett stock picks continue to include a secret stock. Speculation was high that Buffett’s mystery holding would be revealed when his company, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK.A/NYSE:BRK.B) latest 13F regulatory filing was made public. But no such luck. The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, has continued to ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for confidential treatment of one of his stocks. Buffett has done this before. In late 2020, he kept secret the positions he was building in oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and telecommunications firm Verizon (NYSE:VZ). So, what is the latest mystery stock?', 'While the internet is awash with guesses, Barron’s notes that the new stock is likely a financial company. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in its recent filings that its cost basis in financials had gone up by $1.2 billion, while its cost basis in other groups of stocks declined. Also, Berkshire hasn’t added to its existing holdings of financial stocks in recent quarters, meaning that it invested in an entirely new company. Eventually, Warren Buffett’s secret stock pick will be revealed. In the meantime, here are our top three guesses.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Three things might make Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) attractive to Buffett right now. First, the investment bank’s main business is wealth management, making it less susceptible to economic cycles and deal-making than most other Wall Street firms. Second, Morgan Stanley is under new management with a new CEO at the start of this year, Ted Pick, a longtime insider at the bank. Pick succeeded former longtime CEO James Gorman, who retired on Jan. 1.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Lastly, MS stock looks undervalued, and Buffett remains, at heart, a value investor. Year-to-date, Morgan Stanley’s stock has declined 8%, bringing its 12-month decline to 11%. Currently, the stock is trading at the same level it was three years ago and is going for 16 times future earnings estimates, which is below the average among stocks listed in the S&P 500 index. Plus, Morgan Stanley pays a hefty dividend of $0.85 a share per quarter, giving it a yield of 3.93%. And Buffett continues to prize dividends.', 'It might be that Buffett is buying MS stock in hopes that it will rebound once interest rates move lower, as is widely expected later this year.', 'Federal Agricultural Mortgage (NYSE:AGM), also known as Farmer Mac, checks many boxes for Warren Buffett. Essentially, the company is a bank for farmers and rural communities across America that has the backing of the federal government. The president appoints five of the 15 board members at Farmer Mac. Buffett would, no doubt, like that Farmer Mac has the backing and oversight of the government at the highest levels.', 'At the same time, the federal and state governments protect much of the farm sector. Owing to its close government relationships, Farmer Mac has lower interest-rate risk than most commercial and investment banks. And, manyanalysts say we’re now entering a commodities super cycle, with agriculture prices set to rise. AGM stock also looks comparatively cheap right now, trading at 11 times 2024 earnings estimates. Buffett tends to buy stocks for 15 times earnings or less.', 'Farmer Mac also pays a decent dividend of $1.10 per share each quarter for a yield of 2.38%. This year, AGM stock is down 1%. But it has gained 35% in the last 12 months and is up nearly 130% over five years.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Buffett is a big fan of insurance companies. Berkshire Hathaway already owns several insurers, including GEICO and General Re. Barron’s suggests that Buffett might be targeting another insurance company in Chubb (NYSE:CB). While that’s a good guess, so is Aflac (NYSE:AFL). Buffett is well-known for liking the premiums insurers collect that can be re-invested, known as “the float.” Aflac would be a nice complement to Berkshire’s other insurance holdings because it provides supplemental insurance coverage.', 'Additionally, Aflac is trading at a comparatively cheap valuation at just 10 times future earnings estimates. AFL stock pays a healthy dividend of $0.50 a share per quarter for a yield of 2.52%. Aflac’s valuation is lower and its dividend is higher than Chubb’s. Plus, the company generates about 70% of its income in Japan, where work and government insurance coverages are less generous. Buffett is keen on Japan right now, having placed big bets in recent years on the country’s trading houses.', 'On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:UHS). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Universal Health Services’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' View our latest analysis for Universal Health Services ', ""Good news, investors! Universal Health Services is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that Universal Health Services’s ratio of 16.6x is below its peer average of 24.02x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. However, given that Universal Health Services’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Universal Health Services' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since UHS is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UHS for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UHS.

Dividend stocks are especially attractive options because you can choose to reinvest your quarterly payouts automatically rather than taking the cash. You'll accumulate more shares over time that way, amplifying your long-term returns."", ""The dividend stocks you pick should have excellent expansion opportunities and a good chance at boosting their earnings power over time. And ideally, they'll be market leaders that pay a generous -- and growing -- dividend."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) fits this description perfectly. Let's look at why the beverage giant is worth buying if you're considering putting some cash to work in a top dividend stock."", ""Coke is boosting sales at a healthy rate these days even while peers struggle with growth challenges. Organic sales were up 12% through the 2023 fiscal year on top of big gains a year earlier. Contrast those results with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), which expanded its beverage business by 7% in the same period, and there's a clear winner to favor right now."", ""Coke gets a lift from its industry leadership position, its focused portfolio centered around on-the-go beverages, and its market-trouncing efficiency. There's plenty of growth available outside of traditional sparkling sodas, too. Coke is winning in areas like energy drinks, teas, waters, and alcoholic drinks. It already accounts for a significant portion of all beverages consumed around the world, but there's room for that metric to improve in the years and decades to come."", ""The dividend is easily covered by Coke's rock-solid finances. Start with free cash flow, which improved to $9.7 billion this past year from $9.5 billion in 2022. Management is projecting a slightly heavier spending year in 2024 so that cash flow slips to around $9.2 billion. That's still well above the $8 billion it paid in dividends in the past 12 months."", ""Earnings trends are just as strong. Coke benefited from rising prices and higher sales volumes in 2023, allowing profit margin to edge up to 29.1% of sales from 28.7% of sales in 2022. That's about double PepsiCo's profitability and it means dividend investors have every reason to feel confident that their payout can keep rising over the coming years -- just as it has for roughly the last 60 years."", ""It's true that you'll have to pay a premium to own this top dividend stock. Coke shares are priced at 5.8 times sales, more than double PepsiCo's valuation. Yet that price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has been as high as 7 at several times in the past five years. Coke has become cheaper as Wall Street shifted its preference toward high-growth stocks in areas like tech."", 'Dividend investors should consider taking advantage of that short-term change in sentiment to pick up this stellar business. Sure, Coke is expecting sales growth to slow to between 6% and 7% this year, and its earnings will likely just expand by about 5%.', ""Yet, steady gains in both these metrics are what shareholders have come to expect from the sparkling beverage leader. Some years bring unusually strong growth, while others are more modest. But through it all, Coke tends to have no problem capitalizing on its massive competitive advantages. That's a big reason why you'll likely be happy to have this dividend stock in your portfolio over the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

But what does a Japanese recession mean for U.S. companies? Two decades ago, a receding Japanese economy would have spelled disaster for many American brands and consumers. However, much global manufacturing has shifted from Japan to China and Southeast Asia.', 'Nowadays, American companies more commonly utilize the highly developed Japanese economy as a market for reciprocating culture with Japan. This approach has led many American brands to flourish in Japan. The investing and consumer sectors have seen successful growth as the Japanese people favor US goods and services.', 'Unfortunately, in times of recession, foreign and imported goods struggle to compete with domestic as local economies shrink. As such, three U.S. stocks may struggle due to a Japanese recession.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'The world’s largest bank by market capitalization, JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), holds deep financial connections with the global economy. JPM’s relationship with Japan dates back to 1924, when JPM underwrote 150 million dollars in recovery bonds after the Great Kanto Earthquake. Then, after World War Two, Chase National Bank became one of the first foreign banks to open in Tokyo, Japan.', 'This dedication to the Japanese economy has made JPM the premiere foreign investment option for the country. Thus, this close banking relationship could suffer as the Japanese recession intensifies due to a decreasing population and lower productivity. Therefore, the bank’s profitability seems unlikely to survive the wave of defaults that come with a localized recession.', 'For US investors owning JPM stock, this means keeping an eye on the intensity and severity of the Japanese recession. For now, the gradual economic contractions in Japan are likely to be offset by JPM’s success in other global markets.', 'Source: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.com', 'In recent years, the American clothing giant, Gap (NYSE:GPS) has seen significant expansion in the Japanese consumer market. Much of this success comes from Gap’s dedication to affordable minimalist clothing, which resonates well with Japanese culture. Furthermore, Gap has mastered its digital marketing angle, leading to over 100 Gap-owned stores opening nationwide.', 'Unfortunately, the foremost industry that a recession impacts most is retail, of which all of Gap’s revenues in Japan fall under. This is because recessions result in a significant decrease in consumer spending, resulting in excess stock.', 'For retailers like Gap, this means an inability to clear stock, forcing it to sell at a lower price. In turn, profitability in the region decreases, and storefronts close due to operating costs. For Gap investors, the Japanese recession may significantly impact the brand’s international value and decrease stock price.', 'Source: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.com', 'Maker of America’s most famous blue jeans, Levi (NYSE:LEVI), has been a fashion staple in Japan for decades. Moreover, the explosion of denim’s popularity in post-WWII Japan led to a phenomenon where Japanese-made denim became a luxury item. Today, denim lovers abroad laud Japanese selvage denim for its lightweight qualities and softness compared to traditional denim.', 'Levi’s successfully tapped into the manufacturing prowess of Japanese denim mills in the 1950s and has prospered since. Today’s Levi’s markets its Japanese-made jeans as the best the company offers in terms of quality and style. As the Japanese economic output decreases, operating costs and staffing issues will likely increase the price of these premium jeans.', 'For consumers in Japan and abroad, these denim products will become less accessible, cutting into Levi’s luxury product profit base. Fashion-forward investors may want to pay close attention to Japanese operating costs when considering LEVI.', 'On the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Viktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.
