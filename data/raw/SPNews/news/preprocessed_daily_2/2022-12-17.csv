If you want to see more best technology stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined.As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 7.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite or simply Nasdaq, has retreated 29.44% in 2022.Of the three major indexes, the Nasdaq has decreased the most because it includes many growth stocks whose valuations have been negatively affected by the rising interest rates. Furthermore, the Nasdaq gives more weight to some big tech companies whose valuations have declined substantially this year as capital has moved from the tech sector into Treasuries given the higher yields.Federal Reserve's Interest Rate PolicyWhile October and November core inflation were lower than expected, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates next year.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, ""The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.""As for whether the increasing rates will cause a recession, Powell added, ""I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not. And if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not — it’s just not knowable.""If there is a moderate to severe recession next year, tech companies listed on the Nasdaq could face more headwinds.Tech StocksWhile many tech stocks have declined given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, some tech stocks have managed to do better than the Nasdaq for various reasons. Some tech stocks have done well this year because they have increased their earnings significantly more than expected. Other tech stocks have done well because their stocks have simply declined less than the Nasdaq given the strength of their businesses.Story continuesNevertheless, given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.booths, trade show, smau 2011, show tech, tech, people fair, milano editorial, people trade show, fair, hi tech show, exhibition, persons trade show, stands, smau, visitinAdriano Castelli / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 tech stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the Nasdaq's 29.44% decline as of December 14.

While its shares might be lower this year, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has substantial long term earnings power given how difficult it is to compete with the company in terms of making essential semiconductor production equipment.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.Like ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are technology stocks that have outperformed the NASDAQ this year.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Suggested articles:15 Countries with Lowest Interest Rates25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldTop 15 Most Advanced Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $27.5 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nucor shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nucor is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Steel - Producers industry that ranks in the Bottom 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.57 per share to $4.22 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nucor right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The steel giant expects fourth-quarter earnings to be between $4.25 and $4.35 per share. This suggests a decline from $6.50 per share in third-quarter 2022 and $7.97 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company also noted that its full-year 2022 earnings remain on track to exceed the record earnings of $23.16 per share it set last year.The company sees earnings to decline significantly in the steel mills segment on a sequential comparison basis in the fourth quarter. The expected decline is due to lower average selling prices, margin contraction and lower shipment volumes.The biggest decline in profitability has been forecast at its sheet mills. The company expects shipments for its bar mills to be lower in the fourth quarter due to seasonal factors with customers lowering inventories as year-end approaches.Nucor expects its steel products segment to deliver strong earnings in the fourth quarter. However, the segment’s earnings are projected to decline modestly on a sequential comparison basis on reduced selling prices and volumes. The company also noted that economic uncertainties and recession concerns could impact future demand.Earnings for the raw materials unit are forecast to decline significantly in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to lower profitability of the company’s DRI facilities and reduced selling prices for raw materials. Planned outages impacted the DRI facilities during the fourth quarter.Nucor bought back roughly 3.1 million shares at an average price of $130.30 per share during the fourth quarter.

Total steel mills shipments fell 10% year over year in the third quarter. Earnings of the company’s steel mills unit declined on a sequential comparison basis in the quarter, hurt by metal margin contraction and lower shipping volumes, especially at its sheet and plate mills.The U.S. steel industry has lost momentum since April this year as steel prices have witnessed a significant downward correction after a massive spike in March 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.U.S. steel prices have tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand.Demand in the automotive market weakened due to the semiconductor crunch, hurting automotive production.

Since Covid-19 is believed to be originated in Wuhan city of China, it was the first country to undergo a complete lockdown prohibiting any further manufacturing of these components, which was a huge blow to the lighting sector. In 2019, the global lighting market size was estimated at $118.33 billion and is expected to reach $163.72 billion by 2027.The rise in the adoption of solar power technology is expected to greatly boost the lighting market. According to a published report by the program initiated by World Bank ""Lighting Global"", the global off-grid market size of the solar sector is $1.75 billion. The solar power sector is important to the lighting industry because it will enable electricity access to people in remote areas where electricity is currently not available, creating demand for lighting products. With the world going towards sustainability, the lighting market of GCC (Gulf Co-operation Council) is also expected to emerge as a major market due to itEven if we analyze the global lighting market region-wise, developing regions seem to be the most promising ground for the growth of the lighting sector, especially the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Africa. The market in the Middle East can expect robust growth mainly due to the rising population, which drives huge investments in infrastructure and mega-events, ultimately increasing the demand for lighting systems. With the world moving towards sustainability, the countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are expected to be a major market in the near future for sustainable lighting products, with the council showing strong intent to reduce the carbon footprint.Story continuesPhoto by Omar Tursić on UnsplashThe lighting market is divided into several segments. These include LEDs, LFLs (LED flat lamps), CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps), HIDs (High-Intensity Discharge), incandescent, and halogens. The LED segment is expected to be the highest-growing segment due to several reasons, including its increasing applications and low maintenance cost. LEDs are much more efficient and environmentally friendly compared to other segments with far fewer carbon footprints. This environmentally driven edge has compelled several big manufacturers to shift to LEDs over the past decade. In 2020, the value of the global LED market stood at $76 billion. The market value is expected to grow to $160 billion by 2026, with a CAGR of over 13% in the coming years. A report by Statsita presented a breakdown of the global LED market based on its applications. In 2021, general lighting applications accounted for 33% of the worldwide revenue of the LED market, while the automotive sections accounted for 18%.Our MethodologyWe have picked the 14 biggest lighting companies in the world and have ranked them in order of their annual revenue.14.

(NYSE:AYI) contributed to portfolio performance as the Company continued to generate strong revenue growth while protecting margins in the face of a particularly difficult inflationary environment. The Company's fiscal fourth quarter results (released in early October) reflected +12% revenue growth with over +15% adjusted operating margins that are near all-time highs from a year ago. Acuity is managing inflationary pressure by constantly re-engineering their lighting and control products while also enacting more than a half-dozen price increases over the past 2 years. The Company's backlog continues to build as commercial office, education and industrial facilities owners invest in much needed renovations. The secular move toward more energy-efficient commercial lighting solutions is a long-term driver for Acuity products.

12,8ecf0141-b079-3b1a-8e42-3bcdd8814174,ARE,2022-12-17,3 REITs With Recent Dividend Hikes to Help Survive Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-recent-dividend-hikes-132101468.html,1671196861,STORY,"['O', 'ARE', 'MAA-PI']","[Are you are planning to pour your hard-earned money into the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, or have already invested in it? Then you must be worried about the recent 50 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate this week by the Federal Reserve and the indication that the rates might be kept higher for an extended period of time.However, rather than worrying, a focus on the unique feature of this distinct asset class can fetch you a steady income and help to survive market volatility.In fact, with the roller coaster ride in the stock market this year — thanks to high inflation and a quick rise in interest rates that is weighing on asset prices — the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors.Income-seeking investors still have a large appetite for REIT stocks, as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Ushering in good news for investors, particularly income-seeking ones, recently, a number of REITs declared their dividend hikes. Among them are Realty Income Corporation O, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA.What’s more to drive you to invest in REITs?What’s more encouraging is REITs’ characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth.This hybrid asset class not only provides protection against inflation but also benefits from the improving fundamentals of the underlying asset categories as well as the location of properties. In fact, with the waning of the pandemic-related concerns, REITs, which invest in all types of properties, from residential, industrial, offices and malls to hospitals, hotels, data centers and several others, are experiencing an improvement in a number of these asset categories.Also, according to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs’ operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations and net operating income, respectively.Story continuesAs REITs continue to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now, if REITs’ historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Let’s discuss these REIT stocks in detail:Headquartered in San Diego, CA, Realty Income is engaged in the acquisition and management of freestanding commercial properties that reap rental revenues under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $40.54 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This week, Realty Income announced its 118th common stock monthly dividend hike since the company’s NYSE listing in 1994. Delighting its shareholders, the company will now pay out 24.85 cents per share in dividend compared with the 24.80 cents paid earlier.The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13 to shareholders on record as of Jan 3, 2023. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.982 per share compared with the prior rate of $2.976.O currently pays investors $2.98 per share, or 4.60%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 24 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 2.98% over the same time period. Check Realty Income’s dividend history here.Realty Income Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)Realty Income Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)Realty Income Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Realty Income Corporation QuoteThe latest hike reflects Realty Income’s ability to generate decent cash flow through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. It derives more than 90% of its annualized retail contractual rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and a low-price-point component to their business.Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing and provide more reliable streams of income. Realty Income maintains high occupancy levels consistently, and its diversified tenant base, accretive buyouts and robust balance sheet bode well for its growth.Pasadena, CA-based Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is an office REIT, focusing particularly on collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $24.68 billion.On Dec 5, Alexandria Real Estate announced a 2.5% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 cash dividend payout. Alexandria will now pay out a dividend of $1.21 per share, up from the $1.18 paid out in the third quarter. The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13, 2023 to shareholders on record as of Dec 30, 2022.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $4.84 per share. For the year ending Dec 31, 2022, the common stock dividend marks an increase of 24 cents or 5% year over year.ARE currently pays investors $4.72 per share, or 3.14%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 11 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 6.11% over the same time period. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Moreover, Alexandria’s current payout ratio is 57%.

Dividend Yield (TTM)Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteThe high demand for ARE’s Class A properties in AAA locations is boosting the level of occupancy and driving growth in rents. The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life science markets.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Looking at the company’s solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.Mid-America Apartment Communities, also known as MAA and based in Germantown, TN, is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $19.13 billion.On Dec 13, MAA’s board of directors approved an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend payment. The company will now pay out $1.40 per share, which reflects a hike of 12% from the prior dividend of $1.25.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.60 per share, denoting an increase of 60 cents per share from the prior dividend level. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 13, 2023. MAA has delivered 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.MAA currently pays investors $5.00 per share, or 3.10%, on an annual basis. The company increased its dividend 7 times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 4.95% over the same time period. MAA's payout ratio currently sits at 62% of earnings.

Dividend Yield (TTM)MidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | MidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteMAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio of suburban-focused communities was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and population inflow into the company’s markets as renters sought more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities.Amid these, MAA is poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared with expensive coastal markets. MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Looking at its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), it seems that its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cintas acknowledges the importance of transitioning its fleet as it continues along its Path to Net Zero.""Our ability to remove vehicles powered by fossil fuels from our fleet and introduce vehicles that run on renewable or alternative fuels will be an important factor in our ability to achieve our Net Zero ambition and reduce our carbon emissions intensity,"" said Christy Nageleisen, Cintas Vice President of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) and Chief Compliance Officer.""When we meet with employee-partners in the field, the EV pilot program is always near the top of their interests. There's a lot of excitement and anticipation throughout the organization about our EV program, and we're eager to see how these pilot vehicles perform while out in service and running our routes,"" Nageleisen added.Hitting the RoadCintas' EV pilot program officially launched in early 2022 when the first vehicle was deployed in the Los Angeles area.To date, 17 different vehicles from five different manufacturers are or have been included in the pilot program with additional units in Cincinnati, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Minneapolis, Minnesota; San Francisco, California; San Jose, California; and Seattle, Washington.Evaluating EVs in ActionThe pilot program will help Cintas evaluate the performance, durability and reliability of various EVs in a variety of business, weather and road conditions. Using the vehicles in real-world conditions is intended to help the company better understand the expectations, benefits and potential challenges of EVs in its unique route-based business.Story continues""When we originally decided to pilot the (electric) vehicles, we wanted to test markets that were cold, hot, that had snow - that had all the different weather conditions - so that we ensured we got the right vehicle for the right industry."" said Mark Bolen, Cintas Vice President of Quality and Engineering, whose group oversees the company's fleet. ""Up until this point, the technology wasn't out there to start a program like this. Over the last two or three years, they've really come along to where the technology's there.""Cintas' Fleet Department works closely with various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to identify additional opportunities, new technologies and future use cases that can maximize the effectiveness and performance of the EVs in the pilot program.""We are constantly talking to our vendors, meeting weekly on conference calls, sharing information, then our team - the fleet team - actually has phone calls with our operations to understand exactly what's transpiring throughout the week,"" Bolen said. ""We're making sure the vehicle is performing where we want it to, and then we're constantly making that range go out a little bit further, and a little bit further, a little bit further.""What's AheadAs 2023 approaches, Cintas plans to procure and deploy additional EVs around its business footprint.""We have a unique business and our fleet has unique use cases, and we expect our fleet will continue to include different vehicle models, including various light-, medium-, and heavy-duty units to meet the needs of our business."" Bolen said. ""As more options and technologies are developed, and more OEMs enter the commercial EV and alt-fuel markets, we expect to grow the pilot program in both quantity and scope.""Additional grant funding has already been secured through different government initiatives and the company has plans to expand the current roster of EVs with as many as 50 additional units in the next calendar year. Cintas also plans to pursue additional opportunities to test and deploy new technologies from different manufacturers as they become available.Cintas leaders are also monitoring innovations and developments in other types of alternate-fuel vehicles. Along with its ambition to achieve Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050, the commercial vehicle industry will also continue to evolve with new technologies and capabilities.Bolen notes that Cintas remains open-minded about the types of vehicles the company will choose for its fleet over the long term, and that the company is anxious to evaluate new renewable and alternate-fuel vehicles when they're available: ""Who knows what the new technology will be in the next 5, 10, 15 years?""Learn MoreImages of Cintas EVs, and video files, are available for media use at Dropbox (link below).

Out-of-work circus performers Doc and Amelia Farmer went around to Cincinnati-area businesses and collected their dirty, discarded shop rags from their trash bins, and brought the dirty rags home to launder them. When the rags were clean, Doc and Amelia then sold them back to area businesses, thereby extending their useful lives and reducing companies' ongoing need to replace their discarded rags with brand-new rags.Since then, the company has grown and expanded business operations to include uniform and apparel rental programs, facility services, first aid and safety products and services, and fire protection services.Cintas' cultural focus on its Principal Objective, Corporate Character and Management Systems - defined by Founder Dick Farmer in his book, ""Spirit is the Difference"" - has resulted in ESG-centric business practices embedded holistically into Cintas' operations from its start.Cintas' 2022 ESG Report will be published in January.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $40.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off.

Currently, Edwards Lifesciences is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Medical - Instruments industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

15,9bcc43bc-fc47-3d58-9efd-3f2f12bc367d,WMT,2022-12-17,Walmart Is Attracting More High-Income Earners — Here’s Why,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-high-income-earners-buying-140047565.html,1671206410,STORY,['WMT'],"[buzbuzzer / Getty ImagesWith stubborn inflation reflected in prices rising everywhere — even though it decreased to 7.7% in October — even high-income shoppers are looking for bargains and trying to stretch their dollars. With the consumer price index (CPI) food index rising 0.6% in October — a whopping 10.9% annually — it’s no wonder that even those with more money are turning to big-box retailers such as Walmart to buy groceries.Good To Know: 9 Costco Brand Items That Aren’t Worth the MoneySee: 3 Easy Tips To Turn Your Credit Woes Into WowsInflation Affects Everyone“Retail sales were up 1.3% in October, so the good news is that Americans are spending,” said Kate Cheesman, vice president of customer success, DailyPay. “Of course, high-income earners feel the pinch of inflation like everyone else. More and more people are committing to shopping smarter and more efficiently, especially around the holidays. Walmart, Target, and Dollar Tree are great examples of retailers who provide a wide selection of products at competitive prices. Those at all income levels relish the opportunity to secure a great deal.”To put this in context, 90% of Americans say they are concerned about food prices, according to a Harris Poll survey, while a survey from Numerator shows that inflation is indeed changing shoppers’ habits.In turn, Walmart — which reported annual U.S. sales growth of 8.2% for the third quarter — has been attracting higher income shoppers for the past few months, as explained by its executives during the company’s’ most recent earning calls.“Customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often, including higher-income customers,” said CEO Doug McMillon on the call, according to the transcript of the Nov. 15 call.And CFO John David Rainey added that while the chain is seeing continued gains in the grocery market share from households across income demographics, “nearly three-quarters of the share gain [is] coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income.”Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?Why Is Walmart Such a Draw?So what makes Walmart different and attractive?According to Food Industry, Walmart — while not technically a supermarket — dominates the U.S. grocery market as it is the largest food retailer in the country and the No. 1 grocery chain. It was the leader in grocery sales — accounting for more than one-quarter of all grocery revenues in the U.S., Food Industry added. And its footprint is also impressive, as the chain operates 10,586 stores and clubs under 46 banners in 24 countries.In turn, Walmart’s dominance means it can offer lower grocery prices as it has more leverage when dealing with vendors. “Walmart can demand the lowest price from vendors and manufacturers and get the lowest price from them because they have so many stores,” John Karolefski, grocery store analyst and editor of Grocery Stories, told CNBC.“No one wants to pay more when they can pay less and this extends to high income families. Everyone wants a deal,” said Bobbi Rebell, author of “Launching Financial Grownups” and personal finance expert at Tally. “We also are in a time when even high-income earners are concerned about the economy and are looking to boost their savings and create as much financial security as possible. That means being smart when it comes to spending. Just because you can pay more, doesn’t mean you should.”More From GOBankingRatesZelle Scams on Facebook Marketplace: How To Recognize and Avoid ThemTake a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewThe 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Walmart Is Attracting More High-Income Earners — Here’s Why]"

If you want to see more cheap stocks to buy that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.A cheap stock is a stock of a company that's trading for below its intrinsic value.Given that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined in 2022 and many cheap stocks have become even cheaper this year as their valuations have decreased.In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 7.16%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 29.44% in 2022 as of December 14.As a result of the market decline, there are many stocks that trade for relatively low forward P/E ratios. If there is a recession next year, some of the stocks with the low forward P/E ratios might not look as cheap because many companies might not earn as much as analyst estimates. If companies miss earnings substantially and lower their outlooks, analyst earnings for the future could come down and their forward P/E ratios could go higher.Given forward P/E ratios are not very dependable if companies miss their estimates, some investors use analyst price targets in addition to identifying stocks with competitive advantages to decide whether a stock is cheap or not.2022While the market has declined this year, some cheap stocks have outperformed the broader market for various reasons. Some cheap stocks have experienced strong growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. Other cheap stocks have declined less given the strength and stability of their businesses.As for the future, it remains to be seen whether there will be an economic slowdown in 2023. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022, we picked stocks with substantial competitive advantages that either trade below the average analyst price target or trade for below their intrinsic values.We then filtered the stocks to ensure that they outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date as of December 14.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 202212. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 20.03%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35While the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7%, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) has surged 20.03% in 2022 given strong earnings. For Q3, the global aerospace and defense company earned $3.26 per share on sales of $10 billion versus the consensus of $3.15 per share on revenue of $9.92 billion. Analysts see more upside in the future given the average target price of $271.25 per share.Alongside Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a cheap stock that has outperformed the market in 2022.11. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 3.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37In terms of 2022 when all three major indexes have declined, Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has done relatively well with a rally of 3.78%. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) is considered a defensive stock given its retail stores sell low cost products.Given the high inflation this year, demand for Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has increased. In Q3 2022, the company's consolidated net sales rose 8.1% year over year to $6.94 billion and its diluted earnings per share increased 25% year over year to $1.20.Considering the quality of its business, analysts like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) as they have an average price target of $165.36 per share. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 37 owned shares of Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) at the end of September, ranking the stock #11 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 10.16%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best performing tech stocks of the year given its 10.16% rally in 2022 as of December 14. Although the stock actually trades slightly higher than the average analyst price target of $141.66 per share, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has substantial long term intrinsic value given its earnings power. If it can succeed in quantum computing, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) would be even more attractive as well.40 hedge funds in our database owned shares of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #10 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.9. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 9.27%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) has rallied 9.27% this year while the broader market has declined given the railroad company's strong earnings results. For Q3, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 and total sales rose 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Analysts have an average price target of $81.86 per share.Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an August investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -1.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Although its stock hasn't done well in the last five years, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) nevertheless outperformed the market in 2022 given its decline of 1.51% versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% year to date. One reason could be AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)'s valuation with its forward P/E ratio of 7.18 as of December 15, which is pretty attractive if the telecom can earn what analysts expect.In terms of expectations, analysts estimate AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) will earn $2.60 per share in 2022, $2.54 per share in 2023, and $2.60 per share in 2024.7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -6.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67The average analyst thinks there's upside in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) despite the stock of the enterprise software company declining 6.92% year to date. In terms of average estimates, analysts have a price target of $87.25 per share and they estimate Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will earn $4.88 per share in 2023, $5.55 per share in 2024, and $6.33 per share in 2025.67 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #7 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 1.40%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares have rallied 1.4% this year, easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% in the same period. Although inflation has been a headwind for a lot of companies this year, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been able to arguably benefit from it by gaining more customers with its low retail prices.Analysts like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) as they have an average price target of $160.50 per share.Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc.

17,2ed5ed60-bf1a-38e4-985e-234e34050f1b,WMT,2022-12-17,Walmart Inc. (WMT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-wmt-attracting-investor-140002536.html,1671199202,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has lost 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.08 points to a change of -5.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 indicates a change of +8.2% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Walmart, the consensus sales estimate of $158.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.9%. The $605.64 billion and $624.17 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.7% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $1.50 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

19,a0bf3ad2-2aac-3fa7-9c44-cfe0cdc2a754,MGM,2022-12-17,7 Stocks on the Cusp of a Breakout,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-cusp-breakout-190927850.html,1670958567,STORY,"['BAC', 'IBM', 'SHLS', 'XPEV', 'INMD', 'MGM', 'EL', 'RACE']","[It’s time to look for strong, potential breakout stocks. All as the outlook for the U.S. economy and the overall stock market start to improve. For one, there are multiple signs that the economy is not headed for a significant downturn.  In fact, in an interview with CNBC, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan said the yield-curve inversion is not a sign of an imminent recession, but rather due to the attractiveness of the U.S. and of the American dollar.Meanwhile, despite all the hand-wringing about higher consumer debt, America’s household debt to GDP ratio actually fell sharply to 75.6% in July 2022 from 80% in Jan. 2021 and is little changed from 74.9% in July 2019.  Finally, with inflation expectations dropping and most experts agreeing that inflation will continue to fall, inflation and the Fed seem less worrisome. Given all of these points, medium-term and long-term investors should look for breakout stocks to buy at this point.For this article, I looked for stocks that were trading above their key, 50-day, and 100-day moving averages. I also tried to find names with solid volume, underlying fundamentals, and high relative strength scores. Each of the stocks on this list will only have some of, not all of, these attributes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRACEFerrari$224.27INMDInmode$37.49ELEstee Lauder$247.31XPEVXpeng$10.34SHLSShoals Technologies$25.58IBMInternational Business Machines$150.45MGMMGM Resorts$37.04Breakout Stocks: Ferarri (RACE)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksFerarri (NYSE:RACE) closed on Dec. 12 at $222.53, well above its 50-day moving average of $202.69 and its 200-day moving average of $200.96. Additionally, the relative strength score of RACE stock is a strong 88, showing that it belongs on this list of breakout stocks.Better, higher-end consumers are still splurging, which is great news for Ferrari. In fact, the CEO of Saks Fifth Avenue’s e-commerce unit noted, “We’re still getting the big growth online that we want. Compared to the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019, Saks’ [gross merchandise value] sales increased 115 percent,” as reported by Yahoo Finance.Story continuesSo high-end consumers are still splurging. I think the Street is starting to internalize that message, and, consequently, RACE stock is starting to rev up.Breakout Stocks: InMode (INMD)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comInMode (NASDAQ:INMD), which develops minimally invasive technologies used to enhance patients’ appearance, closed at $36.78 on Dec. 12. According to Yahoo Finance, InMode’s 50-day moving average on that day was $34.32, while its 200-day moving average was $31.38.From Oct. 26, the day before InMode reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, until Dec. 12,  its shares have climbed 7%. From Sept. 28 to Dec. 12, INMD stock soared 27%.  The shares are not far from $38.39, the level at which they closed on Nov. 30. That was their highest close since March 30. According to Investor’s Business Daily, InMode’s Relative Strength rating is 87 out of 100.As I’ve noted in previous columns, I believe that the company is benefiting from consumers’ increased spending on their appearances as they travel to see friends and family and resume working in offices and attending social events. Additionally, the shares’ price-earnings multiple should rise as fears about the economy and sky-high interest rates recede.Breakout Stocks: Estee Lauder (EL)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockEstee Lauder (NYSE: EL) closed on Dec. 12 at $244.44, well above its 50-day moving average of $217.39. It’s also closing in on its 200-day moving average of $248.23.  The Dec. 12 close represented the name’s highest closing level since Sept. 14.On Nov. 2, the cosmetics maker reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.37, versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.29. The company’s top line climbed 2% year-over-year and was in line with the mean estimate. Going forward, the company, which has a sizeable business in China, is poised to benefit a great deal from the reopening of that country.On Nov. 2, in reaction to the Q3 results, 7.67 million of EL’s shares changed hands, versus the stock’s current three-month average volume of 2 million.  On Nov. 2,  the stock dropped to $189.38 from $206.13 the previous day. However, on Nov. 4, it climbed to $209.89 on high volume of 6.16 million. On Nov. 30, EL stock jumped to $235.79 from $214.94 on Nov. 29. The volume on Nov. 30 was a strong 3.4 million.Breakout Stocks: Xpeng (XPEV)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) is well-positioned to get a big boost from the reopening of China.  The shares closed on Dec. 12 at $10.47, significantly above their 50-day moving average of $8.75. And while, after struggling for many months, the stock is still well below its 200-day moving average of $20.52, the shares soared an electrifying 51.5% (3.56/6.91) between Nov. 26 and Dec. 12.Meanwhile, financial-news pundits are starting to notice that the company is becoming a leader in the autonomous-driving race. In a column published last week, for example, I wrote that Xpev “looks poised to become a self-driving pioneer in China.” And on Dec. 10, Seeking Alpha columnist Juxtaposed Ideas stated that “XPEV may potentially outperform at a price target of $62.75…significantly boosted by its promising autonomous progress.”It appears that the combination of the reopening of China, combined with Xpeng’s strides in self-driving vehicles, is causing institutional investors to start buying XPEV stock. In recent weeks, the shares have rallied on larger than normal volume. For example, on Dec. 2, XPEV stock soared to $11.45 from $9.97 on the previous day. Nearly 95 million shares of XPEV x changed hands on Dec. 2. And on Nov. 30, 173.5 million shares of XPEV were traded, with the shares bouncing to $10.81 from $7,34 on the previous day. XPEV reported its third-quarter results on Nov. 30.Shoals Technologies (SHLS)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA maker of components for solar-energy projects, Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) has also gotten a boost recently from events involving China.  More specifically, two actions taken by the Biden Administration towards Chinese solar producers should help ensure that there are enough solar panels to meet the demand for them in the U.S. As a result, Shoals should be able to sell more of its products and turn more of its large backlog into revenue.On Dec. 2, U.S. Customs agreed to allow ” a significant shipment of solar panels” made by China’s JinkoSolar to be released into the market. The agency had held the panels because it was suspected that they had been made by slaves in violation of American law. Also on Dec. 2, the Commerce Department determined that several Chinese panel makers, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), had not been avoiding U.S. tariffs by manufacturing their panels in Southeast Asian countries.Shoals closed on Dec. 12 at $24.05, above its 50-day moving average of $23.84 and its 200-day moving average of $19.85. The shares advanced about 20% between Sept. 26 and Dec. 12. On Dec. 2, the name closed at $24.79, up from $23.30 on the previous day, as 17.3 million shares of SHLS changed hands. Over the last three months, the stock’s average trading volume is 2.46 million.IBM (IBM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock closed on Dec. 12 at $149.21, well above its 50-day moving average of $136.76 and its 200-day moving average of $133.28.  The shares closed very close to their 52-week high of $150.46. IBM’s shares have a very strong relative strength rating of 92 and an A+ Accumulation/Distribution rating, which indicates that institutional investors have been buying many shares of the stock over the last 13 weeks.On Oct. 19, IBM reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, as its top line climbed 6.4% year-over-year and it generated $800 million of free cash flow. For all of 2022, the tech giant, whose cloud business has been rapidly growing, predicted that its free cash flow would be roughly $10 billion. On Oct. 20, the day after IBM reported its Q3 results, its shares climbed to $126.79, versus their prior day close of $121.07.

The demand for semiconductors will keep rising as long as advancements and innovations are made in technology. In 2021, global semiconductors sales stood at $555.89 billion, up 26.2% YoY. Some of the leading semiconductor companies include Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).The semiconductor industry has also been affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. The shift to work from home generated demand for more tech devices, and the semiconductor industry struggled to keep up with the demand for chips worldwide. However, as the central banks have started monetary tightening, causing a slowdown in the global economy, the demand for discretionary tech products has reduced, causing a decline in sales for semiconductor companies. In 2023, the total sales of the global semiconductor industry are forecasted to be at $596 billion, a 3.6% decline YoY.In the coming years, the applications expected to drive the global semiconductor industry include electric vehicles and smartphones. In 2020, the smartphone semiconductor market size stood at $116 billion and is forecasted to reach $162 billion by 2030. The global market size for battery electric vehicles in 2020 stood at $47 billion and is forecasted to reach $212 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.1% during the period.Photo by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe picked some of the notable semiconductor stocks that have a low PE ratio and high popularity among hedge funds.

I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen.Today's newsletter features my conversation with Citi's Ed Morse, one of the top energy economists and oil-market forecasters in the business.In a wide-ranging conversation, he breaks down Russia and the US, crude prices, and more.Then, I've got a full slate of weekend reads just for you, from across Insider's Pulitzer prize-winning newsroom.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here.Ed MorseCitigroupEd Morse is the global head of commodity research at Citi Group. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Phil Rosen: What will energy markets look like in 2023, and what's your oil price forecast? Ed Morse: We have an average price for Brent at the end of the year at $76 a barrel. We have WTI ending the year under $70 a barrel. Overall, there will be more market weakness.It'll be another volatile year, but not quite as volatile as 2022. There will be major uncertainty around what we call the ""fragile five"" producers: Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela. And, Russian supply is less certain than in the past.We have an underlying view that we will see an imbalance between supply and demand across 2023, with significantly more supply coming into the market than demand, leading to inventory builds, which should weigh on prices so that we see prices ending the year on average lower than the beginning.How has Russia's role in energy markets changed since it invaded Ukraine? EM: There's been a critical build up in anti-Russian sentiment in Europe, and a rethinking of that relationship, that Europe is overly dependent on Russian supplies. So we had companies — even before governments got involved — saying they were not going to import Russian oil and gas.The surge in Brent from around $85 to $125 a barrel earlier this year was not a function of supply versus demand, but a function of large distortions in the market in which the readily available supply from a close source was being shunned.Story continuesHow has the US's role changed in global energy markets this year?EM: There was a stunning impact on American oil. The US started the year as a 7-million-barrel-a-day exporter of crude products. As the year is ending, our exports have been averaging closer to 10 million barrels a day, and at times close to 11 million. The US supply system has played a really significant role in filling the gaps.And Wednesday data showed the US was exporting 1.483 million barrels a day of diesel — in other words, there's been a 91.8% increase in US exports in diesel. So US refineries are running all out, we're exporting a hell of a lot.What impact have the West's sanctions had on Russia and markets? EM: The impact of December 5 sanctions was not nearly as great as the impact of the shunning of Russian oil at the beginning of the year.But there's clear evidence that sanctions are having a punitive impact on Russia's natural gas. The argument had been that the actions had not punished Russia, and that the price of oil had gone up, and Russia was receiving more revenue than it otherwise would have. But it turned out that the drop in revenue from natural gas exports being lost to Europe had no replacement whatsoever because there was no other place to sell the gas to, so revenue from gas exports plummeted.By August, Russians felt the impact of less revenue on the natural-gas side. That's as quasi-permanent as anything can be for Russian revenue, and their plans had been to expand Russia's position in the natural gas market, not to contract it. They will never be able to replace the lost supply going to Europe. Russia simply doesn't have the technology or the ability to penetrate markets, given the reputational risk.And on the oil side, the lower prices go, as long as there's a discount on Russian crude, they get punished for it, all else equal.Should energy markets be concerned about the February sanctions on refined Russian fuels? EM: Energy markets have been very concerned about it, but their concern is slowing. The diesel market's been exceptionally tight, and the big gap in Europe's supply has been in diesel, where they have turned to Russia for most supply.But now it's the case that diesel has become more abundant.China is exporting diesel again, and may be exporting a record amount of it by the time we get to the first quarter of 2023. Supply has been building in Europe, with refineries making more diesel on their own. There's more refining capacity available in the world, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia increasing refining capacity.But the major, astonishing element really is the US, as I said earlier.Read the full feature on Ed Morse.What did you think of Morse's oil price forecast for 2023? Tweet me @philrosenn, or email me prosen@insider.com.Here's what else to read this weekend:photo of Sergey Brin and Larry Page on a neutral background with triangles in the Google colorsGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have both donated millions to charity through their foundations, but in distinctly different ways.AP; Marianne Ayala/Insider1.

""They will never be able to replace the lost supply going to Europe. Russia simply doesn't have the technology or the ability to penetrate markets, given the reputational risk.""America's growing role in fuel exportsWith sanctions biting into Russia's role as a major energy exporter in recent months, the US has undergone a dramatic shift.The commodities chief explained that, at the start of 2022, US exported about seven million barrels a day of crude products. With 2023 around the corner, that figure has hovered near 10 million barrels a day.

27,a007dd0b-2dbc-397b-b5e9-a9cc00016d56,O,2022-12-17,National Retail Properties vs Realty Income: Which REIT Is a Better Buy?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/national-retail-properties-vs-realty-222259147.html,1671229379,STORY,"['NNN', 'O']","[Every so often an investor comes across two stocks that are both high-quality performers and also pay solid dividends. Then the most difficult part is figuring out which one is the better buy.This is especially true with real estate investment trusts (REITs) within the same subsector. Two REITs may have many similarities, and it really takes some due diligence to decide which is the superior stock.Take a look at two retail REITs, both of which have excellent track records. But one fares slightly better in an extremely close competition.National Retail Properties Inc. (NYSE: NNN) is a net-lease REIT that owns a diversified group of stand-alone retail outlets across the U.S. National Retail Properties has a very stable tenant base with names like 7-Eleven, Sunoco, Best Buy, Camping World, BJ's Wholesale Club and Chuck E. Cheese.Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O), which bills itself as The Monthly Dividend Company, also owns and operates retail properties under long-term net-lease contracts. Its tenants are large, well-known companies like Walgreens, 7-Eleven, CVS, Lowe’s, Dollar General, FedEx and Walmart.Size and Diversity:National Retail Properties has a total portfolio consisting of 3,349 properties across 48 states. Its properties are 99.4% occupied with an average lease term of 10.4 years.Realty Income owns over 11,700 commercial properties across 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Spain. Its most recent tenant occupancy rate was 98.9%.The advantage goes to Realty Income, which has a much larger portfolio in more states and a diversity of international properties as well.Performance Over TimeIn long-term performance since 1995, National Retail Properties has a total return, including nonreinvested dividends, of 612.12% or 7.43% annually, while Realty Income’s total return is 1,271.56%, or 9.82% annually. Over the last five years, Realty Income also holds a 7.07% to 5.46% edge in total return.But over the past 52 weeks, National Retail Properties has had a total return of 5.85%, while Realty Income’s total return was 0.61%. Shorter time frames of one and four months also slightly favor National Retail Properties. This category is a draw, with Realty Income the superior performer over longer time periods, and National Retail Properties outperforming more recently.Story continuesDividend YieldNational Retail Properties pays an annual dividend of $2.20, for a present yield of 4.77%. Realty Income pays an annual dividend of $2.982 for a present yield of 4.62%. The edge goes to National Retail Properties, although the yields are close.Dividend Growth and StabilityNational Retail Properties has raised its dividends for over 33 consecutive years. Over the past five years, National Retail Properties has grown its quarterly dividend from $0.475 to $0.55, with the annual dividend increasing from $1.90 to $2.20. This is an increase of 15.7%.During that same time frame, Realty Income has grown its monthly paid dividend from $0.2063 to $0.2482, with the annual dividend increasing from $2.475 to $2.982, an increase of 20.4%. Neither company has suspended or cut its dividend over the past five years.Realty Income is one of only 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats because it has declared 630 consecutive monthly dividends and increased its dividend 118 times since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994. In addition, it pays its dividend on a monthly basis, which is advantageous for income investors. The difference in growth is significant. A clear edge for Realty Income.Dividend Coverage by FFONational Retail Properties has forward funds from operations (FFO) of $3.12 and an annual dividend of $2.20, for a payout ratio of 70.5%. Realty Income has a forward FFO of $4.01 and pays $2.982 in annual dividends, for a payout ratio of 74%. The lower payout ratio gives a slight edge to National Retail Properties.FFO Multiple (Price/FFO)National Retail Properties has an FFO multiple (P/FFO) of 14.77, while Realty Income has an FFO multiple (P/FFO) of 16.13. The lower multiple gives the edge in this category to National Retail Properties.Debt RatioNational Retail Properties has total debt of $5.55 billion, and its debt-to-equity ratio is 73.93. Realty Income’s total debt is $16.89 billion but its debt-to-equity ratio is 62.88. Owning far more properties gives Realty Income higher debt, but the significantly lower debt ratio means Realty Income wins this category.Most Recent Operating ResultsBoth companies achieved solid third-quarter operating results.National Retail Properties’ third-quarter FFO was $0.79 per share, up 11.2% from $0.71 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue of $193.47 million was up 7.2% from $180.36 million in the third quarter of 2021.Realty Income had a third-quarter FFO of $0.98, up 15.2% from $0.85 in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue of $837.3 million was up 73.1% from $462.33 million in the third quarter of 2021. The better year-over-year results give a clear edge to Realty Income.SummaryNational Retail Properties holds the advantage in the categories of dividend yield, dividend coverage by FFO and FFO multiple.Realty Income has the edge in size and diversity, dividend growth and stability, debt ratio and most recent operating results. Performance over time was basically a draw, with National Retail Properties doing better in the shorter time frames and Realty Income outperforming over the long term.National Retail Properties holds an advantage in three categories, while Realty Income was superior in four categories, and there was one tie.These two retail REITs are both high quality, and the competition was fairly close, but the slightly better stock overall is Realty Income.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.Morgan Stanley hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Morgan Stanley will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Morgan Stanley's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 12%. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 50% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 8.5% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.3% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it odd that Morgan Stanley is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently some shareholders are doubtful of the forecasts and have been accepting lower selling prices.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Morgan Stanley's P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.We've established that Morgan Stanley currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the outlook. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with Morgan Stanley.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NYSE:FE) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.39 per share on the 1st of March. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.8%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for FirstEnergy FirstEnergy's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. At the time of the last dividend payment, FirstEnergy was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 1,129% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 29.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 56% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.20 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.56. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.4% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. FirstEnergy has impressed us by growing EPS at 56% per year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which FirstEnergy hasn't been doing.Our Thoughts On FirstEnergy's DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about FirstEnergy's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While FirstEnergy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, FirstEnergy has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about. Is FirstEnergy not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Gold prices saw their biggest weekly loss in four weeks after the Federal Reserve indicated it was not done hiking rates.The Fed was one of a slew of central banks that jacked up interest rates and signalled that the fight to tame inflation this week.Euro zone bond yields jumped a day after the European Central Bank pledged further monetary tightening to fight inflation.U.S. yields also rose, catching up with the global bond sell-off.Wall Street extended Thursday's rout, in which stocks suffered their biggest daily percentage drop in weeks, after data showed U.S. business activity contracted further in December, but softening demand helped to significantly cool inflation.The data ""confirmed Wall Street's fears that the economy is quickly headed towards a recession,"" said Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.29%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.38% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.17% by 2:13 p.m. EST (1913 GMT).European shares posted their largest weekly loss since September.

Both opted for a smaller increase this time, but flagged there were more increases to come.Its hawkish message prompted a second day of heavy selling across European bond markets where yields on benchmark German 10-year bonds jumped .The yield on Germany's rate-sensitive two-year bond rose as high as 2.503% on Friday,, its highest since 2008.""We now expect the ECB to go to 3.25% (including 50 bps in March) and the Fed to 5.25% which argues for persistent pressure on yields and spreads,"" said Christoph Rieger, head of rates and credit research at Commerzbank.GROWTH WORRIESIn China, where markets are churning around an uncertain reopening, relief at the apparent resolution of a long-running accounting access dispute with the United States was not enough to bolster sentiment.Meanwhile, Japan's manufacturing activity shrank at the fastest pace in more than two years in December, while U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in November.The prospect of further monetary tightening globally kept investors nervous about longer-run growth.In commodities, the spot gold prices rose 0.8%, but were poised to end the week lower. Gold futures settled up 0.7% at $1,800.20 per ounce but ended the week with their biggest weekly loss in four weeks.Interest rate hikes increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.Oil prices dropped, with Brent crude futures down 2.59% and U.S. crude down 2.3%.(Additional reporting by Naomi Rovnick in London and Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Cynthia Osterman)]"

For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Most Coal. The global coal market is worth billions of dollars according to a research report from The Business Research Company. The research firm estimates that the market was worth $595 billion last year, and it will sit at $618 billion by the end of this year after growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9%. It shares that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has stimulated coal prices, as the global commodities market has been upended because of the war. The Business Research Company adds that from 2022 to 2026, the industry will grow at 3.7% to be worth $715 billion by the end of the forecast period.Since one of the biggest uses of coal is in power generation, it's also worthwhile to take a look at this particular market subsegment. Fortunately, a report from Mordor Intelligence analyzes the global coal fired power generation market. It states that the industry generated 10,100 terawatt hours of electricity in 2018, growing from 9,806 terawatt hours in 2017.

The yellow metal is likely to gain next year on improving demand, fears of a recession and geopolitical tensions.With gold prices anticipated to gain further on demand-supply imbalance, companies like Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV, Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, AngloGold Ashanti AU and Galiano Gold Inc. GAU are well-poised for growth, backed by their strong balance sheets, efforts to lower costs and growth initiatives.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Gold industry mainly comprises companies engaged in extracting gold from mines. The mines may be either underground or open pits. Mining is a long and complex process, and requires significant financial resources. It involves exploration to evaluate the deposit's size, followed by assessing ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, and, finally, develop the mine before the actual mining process. It normally takes 10-20 years for a gold mine to produce material that can finally be refined. The players in the industry nowadays use a range of sophisticated techniques to extract gold and convert it into dore bars, an alloy of gold and silver, alongside other impurities. These are then sent for purification, following which gold is purchased in the forms of bars or coins or used in jewelry or for other purposes.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Gold IndustryGold Prices Regain Ground: The yellow metal started this year on a strong note, hitting a high of $2,078.70 an ounce in the first week of March. However, it soon lost steam as the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018 to tame the mounting inflation. Since then, for a major part of 2022, gold prices remained under pressure (even dropped to as low as $1,618 an ounce) due to monetary tightening by central banks around the world. Gold prices have, however, regained ground lately. It crossed the $1,700 an ounce mark in November as the Fed meeting that month signaled a likelihood of a slowdown of rate hikes. Gold rose 7% in November, breaking the seven-month decline stint. So far in December, gold has gained 2% and peaked at $1,836.90 an ounce on Dec 13, following the release of the lower-than-expected U.S. annual inflation figures. Gold has since steadied, closing at $1,787.80 an ounce on Dec 15, as the Fed offered a more hawkish outlook on its policy than markets anticipated. At its last meeting, the Fed delivered a smaller half percentage point rate hike but projected a terminal rate of 5.1% next year, higher than previously stated. While rate hikes pose challenges to gold, continued geopolitical risks and fears of recession will likely drive the demand for gold as a hedge.Story continuesLabor Issues, High Costs Persist: The industry continues to face a shortage of skilled workforce, causing a spike in wages. The industry players are persistently grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control gold prices, it focuses on improving sales volume and operating cash flow, and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources, such as solar or wind farms, to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.India and China to Support Demand: India and China together account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. A pick-up in demand in China is expected next year, aided by fewer COVID disruptions, a cautious economic rebound and a gradual pick-up in consumer confidence. Retail demand in India is expected to improve on improved consumer confidence and pent-up demand. The demand for physical gold is seasonally higher in the later part of the year, aided by the festival and wedding season in India.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance to Support Prices: Depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines remain inherent threats to the industry. Due to the scarcity of discoveries and exhaustive existing resources, miners prefer building up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging new ones that are inherently risky and capital-intensive. On the demand side, the use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology is rising. The yellow metal has long been considered a safe-haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty. So, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices. This bodes well for the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Mining - Gold Industry, which is a 39-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it at the top 39% of 248 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Mining-Gold Industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the Basic Material sector, in a year. The stocks in the industry have collectively gained 5.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector’s decline of 2.0% and 15.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA, a commonly used multiple for valuing gold-mining companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 6.86X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 10.57X and the Basic Material sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 6.17X. This is shown in the charts below.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M RatioEnterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M RatioOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.24X and as low as 4.63X, with the median being 6.30X.4 Mining-Gold Stocks to Keep an Eye onAngloGold Ashanti: The company recently completed the acquisition of Coeur Mining’s (CDE) C-Horst, SNA, Secret Pass and Daisy ore bodies, as well as the decommissioned Sterling Mine in the Beatty district of southern Nevada. The addition of the properties consolidates AU’s ownership position in one of North America’s most promising new gold districts. Gold production for the third quarter of 2022 was up 20% year over year to 738,000 ounces, courtesy of solid performances across the portfolio, bringing the year-to-date total to 1.8 Moz (million ounces). This puts the company on track to meet its production guidance of 2.55-2.80Moz in 2022. The majority of production growth is expected to come from Obuasi, with improvements expected at other assets. The company continues to mitigate the impacts of inflation on its costs through the continued integration of its new operating model (which is aimed at improving operating efficiencies), the operational excellence program already in place, and the Full Asset Potential (FP) program. The FP program aims to achieve a step-change in AngloGold Ashanti’s competitiveness by 2024 and includes a three-month assessment that covers all aspects of the company’s mine sites. The company's shares have gained 43% in the past three months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s, headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2022 earnings has moved up 13% over the past 60 days. AU has a long-term earnings estimate growth rate of 4%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: AUGaliano Gold: The company reported gold production of 43,899 ounces in the third quarter of 2022. Higher production for the quarter was driven by improved metallurgical recoveries and stockpile material performing better than expected. The significant work undertaken in the second quarter of 2022 to optimize the Asanko Gold Mine’s plant performance assisted in the higher recoveries achieved during the period. Backed by the performance, GAU revised its gold production guidance upward to 160,000-170,000 ounces for 2022. Backed by these developments, the company's shares have gained 10.4% in the past three months. GAU concluded the metallurgical test work program at Esaase, which provides greater clarity on the deposit’s metallurgical recoveries. These results, in conjunction with the strong exploration success achieved during the quarter, pave the way to reinstate Mineral Reserves for the Asanko Gold Mine, which will be provided in the upcoming Feasibility Study Technical Report.Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Galiano Gold has an expected earnings growth of 133% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2022 earnings has moved up 133% over the past 60 days. GAU currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Price &amp; Consensus: GAUFranco-Nevada Corporation: FNV appears on a promising long-term trajectory, backed by a healthy portfolio of streaming and royalty agreements on several properties mined by some of the most reputable mining companies in the world. FNV is debt-free and uses its free cash flow to expand the portfolio and pay out dividends. Given its focus on cost management, FNV continues to generate high margins. Franco-Nevada has been enhancing its portfolio without adding significant overhead. The company will gain from mine expansions and the construction of new mines in the years to come. FNV’s shares have appreciated 14.2% in the past three months.This Toronto, Canada-based gold-focused royalty and stream company has a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2022 indicates growth of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate has moved up 3.7% over the past 60 days. FNV has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.3%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Price &amp; Consensus: FNVAgnico Eagle Mines: The company increased its exploration budget. It is reinvesting in its assets to expand output. Agnico Eagle Mines’s sufficient cash flow is enabling it to maintain a strong exploration budget, primarily focused on Kittila, Canadian Malartic, LaRonde, Kirkland Lake, Hope Bay and Santa Gertrudis. Notably, the company’s Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe. It also hosts the company's largest mineral reserve. With the expected completion of the shaft sinking expansion at Kittila in 2022, the annual gold production is expected to increase in 2022 and beyond. The company continues to expand the exploration drilling of Roura Main, Sisar and Rimpi Zones to make use of better grades. AEM has identified LaRonde, Canadian Malartic and Nunavut as the major drivers for cash flow generation over the next several years.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Salesforce.com (CRM).Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.53, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 32 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.53 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 32 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.9% and 3.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in CRM?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 7.8% over the past month to $4.92.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -12.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has lost 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. This estimate has changed +7.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.65 indicates a change of +14.9% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $7.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9%. The $30.93 billion and $34.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.7% and +10.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%.

The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NET) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We continued to build our position in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter as the shares declined with the overall software space and the long-term risk/ reward balance became more compelling. The company reported a strong second quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 54%, as well as better gross and operating margins. Third quarter guidance was also ahead of Wall Street expectations. Given Cloudflare’s proprietary network and massive global scale, its software products have a disruptive price-performance advantage over competitors. As the company introduces new products as well as disruptive packaging/pricing, its unit level economics should continue to improve over time, with the company already well ahead of its long-term gross margin target of 74%, reporting 78.9% for the second quarter. This drives strong cross/upselling activity with customers, reflected in strong net-dollar expansion rates in excess of 125%. Indeed, in the most recent quarters, customers purchasing five or more products reached 81% of the base, six or more products reached 70% of the base, and seven or more products reached 58% of the base. Enterprise penetration continues to be a key long-term driver, with 1,749 customers now spending over $100,000 annually with the company, growing 61% and now accounting for over 60% of total revenue. With approximately 152,000 paying customers at the end of last quarter, large enterprise customers still represent just 1% of total paid customers and thus a material growth opportunity in the coming years. We continue to have high confidence in the company’s ability to innovate at a rapid pace (announced 20 new products or enhancements in September alone), package and bundle with disruptive pricing, and take material share in its large and growing addressable markets.”Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is well-positioned to benefit from the secular tailwinds in the enterprise software and edge computing space. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential12 Dividend stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50010 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2022Disclosure: None. 10 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Central Ave. and 3241 Figueroa St.Veronica Gonzalez, who works at the Figueroa Street location in Cypress Park, joined the picket line Friday with about 10 other workers, standing in the driveway of the coffee shop with signs that said ""Strike!"" and ""No contract, no coffee!""Every few minutes, drivers honked their horns or waved in support of the striking baristas.“Starbucks is doubling down in the union busting, so we’re going to double down,” said Gonzalez, a barista who has worked at the store for three years. “They want to shut down stores, we’re going to show them we can shut down stores too.""Striking Starbucks workers appeal to passing motorists at a Starbucks store in Long Beach on Friday. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times)The stores are among 270 Starbucks locations across the nation that have unionized in the last year — part of a wave of labor movements that has swept the nation, including a strike by University of California academic workers and organizing by Amazon warehouse employees. The Workers United guild, which represents Starbucks employees, said about 100 stores across the U.S. were on strike beginning Friday.Story continues""Every step we take is inspiring more workers to take power back to themselves and to create change in the workplace,"" Keeling said. ""We don't have to sit down and accept these horrible working conditions; we can make a change.""Starbucks, citing safety concerns, recently announced the permanent closure of the first Seattle location to unionize; union leaders noted the closure fell near the first anniversary of the first Starbucks winning a union election. Workers United called it part of an ""anti-union campaign"" by the company.The chain closed a number of Starbucks stores this summer, also citing safety reasons, including six in L.A. None of the locations in Los Angeles were union shops, but union leaders at the time viewed the move as a ""response to the growing union movement spreading across the country.”The relationship between Starbucks — which opposes unionization — and its unionized employees has become increasingly contentious over the last year, with Workers United leaders asking a federal court to intervene four times in matters of alleged unfair labor practices, such as the firing of union leaders and the withholding of pay hikes. Starbucks has also alleged unfair labor practices by the union.The company has asked the national labor board to temporarily halt all U.S. union elections, citing allegations that regional labor officials in Kansas improperly coordinated with unionizing workers.""We remain focused on working together ... to make Starbucks a company that works for everyone,"" the statement from the company said. Starbucks touted its attendance at bargaining sessions; officials planned to appear at more than 75 sessions through the end of the year. But L.A.-area union leaders said none of the sessions had led to meaningful discussions.“We were literally reading our proposals to them and they walked out while we were still speaking,"" said Josie Serrano, a barista at the East 7th Street store in Long Beach. Other union leaders said their stores' bargaining sessions lasted just minutes before Starbucks' representatives left.“We want them to negotiate in good faith,” said Araseli Romero, a 22-year-old shift supervisor at the Central Avenue location. She said the latest bargaining session lasted seven minutes before management and lawyers walked out.Workers at all four locations maintained that there were problems with faulty equipment, that they were short-staffed despite employees being available to work, and that they were given too few hours to qualify for benefits.At the Figueroa Street location, protesters cheered as cars honked and waved, and they talked about the issues with passersby. One driver in Long Beach stuck a thumbs-up out the window, yelling, ""Let's go!"" A Metro bus driver held down his horn as he passed the coffee shop's picketers.But some weren't supportive of the strike, as they tried to get coffee at the closed shops. Darren Burtenshaw walks every day to the Central Avenue shop with his dog Eros and said he was disappointed to see workers taking a stand against a company that he saw as better than most — offering more than minimum wage and programs to help pay for college.“They should be targeting other places and big corporations,” the 57-year-old said. Starbucks ""is actually doing very well by their employees.”But Gonzalez said that was exactly why she joined the union and was on the picket line: to help people understand the conditions workers actually faced.""They claim to be people over profit, but they’re really not,"" she said. “We don’t see things getting better, and if we’re not going to stand up for ourselves, who is?”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Most Corn.Corn, or maize, is one of the most popular crops in the world. It is also one of the oldest known cultivated crops, which traces its history back to what is now Mexico in 8,000 BC, some 3,000 odd years after agriculture cultivation began in the Middle East and allowed humanity to settle down in populations at riverbanks and start to reproduce and grow.The corn industry is at the forefront of employing technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). For instance, sensors from CropX Technologies allow farmers to study the amount of moisture in the soil, which then enables the formulation of better agriculture systems. Apart from this, sensors are also used to study light, wind, rain, and other farming conditions, with researchers also evaluating the role of drones in aggregating this data for better use. The Italian firm New Holland Agriculture is supplying self driving tractors to farmers, which help them reduce labor costs. Additionally, GPS has been a long part of tractors manufactured by the American firm Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), enabling farmers to work in tricky environments and keep track of their equipment. Other renowned players in the agricultural technology and corn industries are Ingredion Inc (NYSE:INGR), Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG), Bayer (OTCMKTS::BAYR.Y), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva Agriscience (NYSE:CTVA).The global corn market itself produced 1,177 million metric tons of the crop in 2021, and is expected to grow at a compounded growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% between 2022 and 2027 to sit at an estimated production tonnage of 1,604 million metric tons by the end of the forecast period according to research from Procurement Resource. The research firm believes that this growth will be driven by the industrial use of corn in areas such as pharmaceuticals, personal care, paper, and sweeteners. Additionally, corn is also thought to be a major contributor to the green revolution, as it can replace petroleum based plastic bags that are among the largest sources of pollution globally.Story continues15 Countries That Produce the Most CornMarcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We used data (FAO.Crops and livestock products. License: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO. Extracted from: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL. Date of access: 13/12/2022) from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to compile this list. The data lists down corn production from countries as of 2020.Countries That Produce the Most Corn15. Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 10 millionThe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, or Ethiopia, is a landlocked African country that is also one of the most populous regions on the continent. The country's economy is worth $345 billion with a low GDP per capita of $3,407. Agriculture is the dominant sector, employing more than half of the population and a 35.5% share of the economy in 2020. Ethiopia produces coffee, potatoes, sugarcane, and oil seeds. Its corn production is 10 million tons as of 2020.14. Romania Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 10.9 million Romania is a central European country with a $731 billion economy and a GDP per capita of $38,097. The country holds more than 14 million hectares of agricultural land out of which 10 million can be used to grow crops. It produces a wide variety of agricultural products such as corn, wheat, potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, watermelon, and barley. As of 2020, Romania had produced 10.9 million tons of corn, and the country was forced to stop producing genetically modified crops in 2017 after it entered the European Union, where major players like Ingredion Inc (NYSE:INGR), Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG), Bayer (OTCMKTS::BAYR.Y), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva Agriscience (NYSE:CTVA) are competing.13. Federal Republic of Nigeria Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 12 millionThe Federal Republic of Nigeria is an African country that is one of the most prosperous countries on the continent. However, it consistently ranks low on human development, transportation, and infrastructure. Its economy is the largest in Africa, and was worth $1.3 trillion in 2022, with a GDP per capita of $5,853. Like other developing countries, Nigeria's economy derives a large portion of its value from agriculture. The country is the world's largest producer of cassava, yarn, taro, and cowpea. It also produces other products such as tomatoes, peanuts, ginger, and palm oil. Nigeria's corn production stood at 12 million tons in 2020.12. French Republic Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 13.4 millionThe French Republic, or France, is one of the most powerful nations in the world and one that has been playing a central role in global politics for more than a century. The French economy is worth $3.6 trillion making it the tenth largest in the world. It is known for agricultural products such as wheat, poultry, beef, and pork. Additionally, as of 2021, France was also the world's sixth largest exporter of agricultural products. As of 2020, the country had produced 13.4 million tons of corn, and half of its land mass is farmland.11. Canada Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 13.6 millionCanada is a North American country that shares its only border with the United States. It is one of the world's largest countries in terms of land mass, and the 15th largest GDP in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Canada's GDP per capita is $57,827, and the U.S. is its largest trading partner accounting for more than half of Canadian exports. It has a vibrant agricultural sector, consisting of grains, livestock, dairy, poultry, and eggs. Some products include dry pea, lentils, soy, oats, beans, rye, onion, and cabbage. Canada produced 13.6 million tons of corn in 2020.10. Russian Federation Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 13.9 millionThe Russian Federation is the world's largest country in terms of landmass and also one of the largest fossil fuel and arms exporters. The Russian economy is worth $4.6 trillion with a $31,967 GDP per capita. Its agriculture industry contributed 5% to the world's GDP in 2021, and owning to its mass, Russia is also the world's third largest cultivated area of land. The country was the world's largest wheat exporter in 2020, and it is home to a large fishing industry as well due to access to 12 seas and a coastline with three oceans. Russia produced 13.9 million tons of corn in 2020. Russian's invasion of Ukraine is causing the world to prepare for a potential food shortage and major companies like Ingredion Inc (NYSE:INGR), Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG), Bayer (OTCMKTS::BAYR.Y), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva Agriscience (NYSE:CTVA) are set to face the reverberations of the effects of this war.9. Republic of South Africa (RSA) Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 15.3 millionThe Republic of South Africa (RSA), or South Africa, is the third largest economy in Africa with a GDP of $435 billion and a GDP per capita of $20,573. It is one of the most developed economies in Africa and the only African member of G20. Additionally, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the largest exchange on the African continent. While agriculture accounts for a small portion of the South African economy, the country nevertheless produces several products such as grape fruits, cereals, sisal, soybeans, and sun flower seeds. South Africa is also one of the world's largest producers of sugar cane, but ranks higher in the list of corn producing countries, through an output of 15.3 million tons in 2020.8. Republic of Indonesia Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 22.2 millionThe Republic of Indonesia is a South East Asian country that is home to one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the world. The Indonesian economy was worth $4 trillion in 2022, making it the seventh largest in the world. The strength of the Indonesian economy can be gauged through the fact that the country underwent its first recession in 2019 since 1997 - and that too because of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly as tourism was one of the hardest hit sectors. The pandemic also affected major companies like Ingredion Inc (NYSE:INGR), Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG), Bayer (OTCMKTS::BAYR.Y), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva Agriscience (NYSE:CTVA).The Republic of Indonesia produces rice, fruits, vegetables, and palm oil. The Republic of Indonesia's corn production stood at 22.2 million tons in 2020.7. United Mexican States Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 27.4 millionThe United Mexican States is a North American country that enjoys a long border with the United States of America. Mexico is thought to be the cradle of modern day agriculture, with the Mesoamericans having started the cultivation of plants such as cotton, avocado, and corn. 15% of Mexican land is dedicated to agriculture, and the country produces sugarcane, tomatoes, wheat, peppers, and coffee. Livestock also forms a large chunk of the Mexican agricultural sector, through products such as beef and milk. As of 2020, Mexico's corn production stood at 27.4 million tons.6. Republic of India Tons of Corn Produced in 2020: 30 millionThe Republic of India is the second most populous nation in the world and has the third largest GDP with a value of $11 trillion in terms of purchasing power parity. It produces products such as rice, milk, wheat, cotton, maize, tomatoes, okra, and onions. Agriculture is one of the largest sectors of the Indian economy and has also seen painful controversies such as mass farmer suicides spanning generations due to high debt alongside a poor road infrastructure that makes shipping agricultural products difficult. India produced 30 million tons of corn in 2020.As major corn and agriculture companies like Ingredion Inc (NYSE:INGR), Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG), Bayer (OTCMKTS::BAYR.Y), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Corteva Agriscience (NYSE:CTVA) come up with new technologies, Indian corn producers are also trying to catch up with new advancements in the industry.Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Most Corn.

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition. The role of software is constantly evolving. With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Synopsys SNPS, Commvault Systems CVLT and DecisionPoint Systems DPSI.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (mostly for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform. Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design and manufacturing and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry’s prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS open up significant opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also much shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Cloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents is driving demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps in delivering a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Hybrid Work to Drive Demand But Macro Headwinds a Concern: The mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions, among others. However, global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability in Europe due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and global supply chain troubles remain concerns. Increasing inflation could affect spending across small- and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector.

High Inflation may reduce overall retail spending and consumption, but alcohol and tobacco products often remain on consumers’ lists of must-haves.Let’s see if big tobacco giants Altria Group MO, British American Tobacco BTI, and Philip Morris International PM can be beneficial investments going into 2023.DividendsWhen it comes to big tobacco stocks, their strong dividends are usually the first attribute that sticks out to investors. In this regard, Altria Group leads the way. Altria offers an impressive 8.01% dividend yield at $3.76 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBritish American Tobacco’s annual dividend yield is second at 6.17%, with Philip Morris at 5.02%. Still, all the big tobacco stocks’ annual dividend yields are above the industry average of 4.98% and the S&amp;P 500 ‘s 1.6% average.Of course, dividends alone are not a reason to buy stocks. Evaluating performance and other fundamental metrics, along with growth is still necessary.Recent Performance The Zacks Tobacco Industry’s total return is +8% in 2022, to impressively outperform broader markets. With such high dividends, the total return does have a direct effect on the overall price movement in big tobacco stocks over a smaller time frame.Year to date, BTI’s total return performance leads the way at +14% Vs. PM’s +9% and MO’s +3%. All three have outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -18%, with only Altria lagging the Tobacco Market’s +8.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last decade, MO’s +149% total return tops PM’s +93% and BTI’s +36%. Only BTI’’s stock is behind the Tobacco Market’s +74%. However, all three big tobacco stocks have lagged the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation Pivoting to valuation, Altria and British American Tobacco stand out. Both stocks trade under $50 a share and just above 9.7X forward earnings. This is on par with the industry average P/E of 9.6X.Story continuesAltria’s stock trades well below its decade-high of 23.5X and at a 33% discount to the median of 14.5X. Similarly, BTI trades nicely below its decade-high of 19.7X and 30% beneath its median of 14.2X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn comparison, Philip Morris trades at $100 per share and 17.4X forward earnings, which is much higher than the industry average. While not appearing to offer a significant discount like its peers, PM stock is still below its decade-high of 24.9X but slightly above the median of 16.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; Outlook Altria sticks out here too, sales are forecasted to decline just over -1% in 2022 but rebound and rise 1% in fiscal 2023 at $21.01 billion. Even better, as shown in the nearby chart, earnings are expected to rise 5% this year and jump another 4% in FY23 at $5.06 per share. Earnings estimates revisions have slightly gone down over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor British American Tobacco, earnings are expected to drop -6% this year but climb 11% in FY23 at $4.74 a share. Earnings estimates are slightly down for BTI over the last quarter. On the top line, sales are anticipated to decline -1% in 2022 but rise 5% in FY23 to $34.49 billion.Looking at Philip Morris, earnings are projected to drop -4% this year and decline -1% in FY23 at $5.71 per share. Earnings estimate revisions are also down for PM stock over the last 90 days. Sales are expected to be down -2% in 2022 and decline another -2% in FY23 at $29.95 billion.Bottom Line These three big tobacco stocks all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. With their total returns being impressively better than the broader market this year, investors might want to consider these equities for 2023 as well.The monstrous dividends have certainly helped these stocks’ overall performance this year and they appear to be fairly valued at current levels. This combination could continue to help investors as most areas of the economy are expected to see slower growth next year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.11%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.85%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.15%.Heading into today, shares of the seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands had gained 6.42% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 3.25% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.19% in that time.Philip Morris will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.30, down 3.7% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.45 billion, down 8.06% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.80 per share and revenue of $30.6 billion, which would represent changes of -4.61% and -2.56%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Philip Morris should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.7% higher. Philip Morris is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Philip Morris has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.47 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 9.66, so we one might conclude that Philip Morris is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that PM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.49. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Tobacco stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.96 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Tobacco industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

72,26d736cc-3cf3-3dca-a997-762db0336293,PM,2022-12-17,Surviving Market Volatility: 3 Low Beta Stocks to Consider,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surviving-market-volatility-3-low-191107343.html,1671217867,STORY,"['CAT', 'DE', 'PM']","[Wall Street’s history is littered with boom-and-bust stories of investors who got overly aggressive and went on to blow up their accounts later. Legendary commodities trader Ed Seykota once famously warned “There are old traders and there are bold traders, but there are no old, bold traders.” The quote is a simple but valuable reminder that investing is a game of longevity, not a game of boom and bust.What makes investing so tricky is trying to balance greed (wanting to make money) with fear (preserving money). Like the weather, the market environment is constantly changing. There are uptrends, down trends, and sideways, choppy markets. For most investors with experience, uptrends and downtrends become evident after a while. Investors may use moving averages or trendlines to identify them and get on board and follow the direction of the trend. However, the most difficult to identify is a rangebound market. Rangebound markets, like the one we’re in currently, have a way of sucking investors into trades and causing stop outs (death by a thousand cuts). These markets are the most dangerous of them all.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: A 6 month chart of the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) shows how choppy the market has been.Below are 3 tips for surviving these problematic markets:·      Patience: In fast markets, it’s best to slow down. In other words, sometimes, the name of the game is capital preservation rather than appreciation. Ted Williams became one of the most prolific batters in baseball history by patiently waiting for his pitch. Lions will quietly stalk their prey for hours before pouncing. As an investor, you always have the option of waiting or trading less until you get a more favorable environment. Wait for the fat pitch.·      Size Matters: The only true risk management parameter in the stock market is position size. If you are oversized in a position and the market or position you are in gaps down overnight, you are in for a bad day. During times of volatility, it is best to decrease position size. By reducing position size, you can better withstand the increase in volatility. Remember, you can always add to a stock later if the market’s volatility decreases.Story continues·      Slow and Steady Win the Race: If you decide to invest in a volatile market, it is best to stick with steady, low-beta names. Beta measures a stock’s volatility relative to the overall market. A beta of 1 signals that the stock moves in tandem with the market. A beta above one means that the stock tends to move more than the market, while a beta below 1 means it moves less than the market. For example, if a stock has a beta of 1.4, it means that the stock moves 40% more than the market. All else being equal, low-beta stocks are less risky than high-beta stocks.Here are 3 stocks to help fight the current market volatility:Caterpillar CAT is a nearly $120 billion global construction and mining equipment manufacturer known for its iconic yellow machines. Caterpillar is attractive in this environment because it has a 1.14 beta, a healthy 2.08% dividend, and holds a high Zack’s Ranking of 2. CAT has the benefit of being in a strong industry group. The Manufacturing – Construction and Mining Group is ranked 15 out of the 248 groups tracked by Zacks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: CAT's set up to have a strong 2023.Deere &amp; Co DE is the world’s largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment. Like CAT, DE has a large market capitalization ($128 billion), a low beta (1.09), and Zack’s Ranking of 2. Since the pandemic crash, agricultural equipment has been in high demand, and Deere’s stock and fundamentals have benefitted as a result. The fact and the matter is that agriculture is a staple in the global economy and as a result, this veteran company will continue to benefit. Last quarter, DE grew EPS by 81% on revenue growth of 37% - an impressive feat for a company of its size. Investors would be hard-pressed to find a more dominant company in its space.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: DE's return on equity is more than double that of its peers.Few businesses are as steady as Philip Morris International PM. Philip Morris manufactures cigarettes and recently has entered the smoke-free, reduced-risk products category. While PM holds a mediocre Zack’s Rank of 3, the stock is the quintessential steady mover. The stock has a beta of just 0.70, which means it tends to swing less than the general market. Furthermore, PM pays a generous dividend of 5.02%. Though it won’t ever likely produce multi-bag gains in a year any time soon, the stock is an excellent place to park capital until the storm passes over.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Despite PM's low beta, the stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in recent months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Novartis AG (NVS) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Amazon.com shares have been big laggards this year, on account primarily of two distinct factors. First, Amazon's growth outlook has gotten cloudier as a result of the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop resulting from the Fed's extraordinary tightening policy that has raised recessionary risks for the U.S. economy. Second, Amazon's near-term growth outlook is weighed down by the pulled-forward growth during Covid. The company heavily invested in human and physical capacity during Covid that has produced somewhat of a mismatch between 'capacity' and demand growth that they are currently in the process of rationalizing through lay-offs and facility shutdowns. The stock is down -47.9% this year vs. the -17.2% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index and the Zacks Retail sector's -26.5% pullback. Amazon's main Retail sector rival Walmart is up +4.8% this year.   Nevertheless, Amazon’s third quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well.Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings were tailwinds.Amazon’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, Amazon Care, Kuiper and Zoox are other positives. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expects 2022 revenue to be up 8.3% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Novartis’ shares have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +15.1%. The company’s performance in the third quarter was pretty ho-hum, as earnings beat by a penny but revenues lagged due to generic competition.With the planned spin off of Sandoz, Novartis is looking to become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Novartis has a strong and diverse portfolio. Solid momentum in key brands like psoriasis drug Cosentyx, cardiovascular drug Entresto, gene therapy Zolgensma, the oncology portfolio and the launch of Kesimpta continue to boost performance.The launch of additional drugs like Pluvicto, Piqray, Leqvio and Mayzent and the label expansion of key drugs should also boost performance further. Management’s focus on cost savings should boost the bottom line as well. However, generic competition for key drugs and pipeline setbacks are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Novartis here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Philip Morris' shares have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+8.4% vs. +3.7%). The company has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Also, focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS has been working well for the company, which is witnessing continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. However, Philip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds. In third-quarter 2022, the proforma adjusted operating income margin fell 1 point on an organic basis.Management lowered its proforma adjusted operating margin organic growth view for 2022, wherein it expects gross margin contraction due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes, the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

Other than the tech companies, which is a story unto itself, generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it's been very, very hard to hire.DAVE BRIGGS: Heard a lot about that concept of hoarding employees in this environment. That, of course, Fed Chair Jerome Powell after announcing a 50-point hike this week. While Powell singled out the tech industry as the one undergoing layoffs this year, news today that the banking sector might not be far behind. Semaphore reporting that Goldman Sachs is preparing to lay off as many as 4,000 employees, around 8% of its workforce. Liz Hoffman broke that story. She joins us now. Liz, nice to see you. Why now is Goldman Sachs laying off 4,000 employees?LIZ HOFFMAN: Goldman is a couple of years into this incredibly high stakes transformation, trying to make itself less reliant on trading and investment banking and dealmaking and into a little bit more of a stable, safer institution. It's not going that well. The short answer is that they massively overhired and overspent on trying to build this consumer bank, this Main Street bank that they are largely now retreating from.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I got to ask you here what the fallout is here for the CEO David ""DJ"" Solomon, D-Sol-- what is it, DJ D-Sol? Is that his name? OK, DJ D-Sol Solomon. All right, here's where I'm going with this. I remember Goldman Sachs back in the day. I'm going back to 2007-08. This was a company that was reportedly calculating their firmwide risk to three decimal points. They were able to pivot on a dime under their previous CEO, Lloyd Blankfein. I'm just wondering, are there comparisons now, fair or otherwise, to D-Sol and the way he's running the business? Are there criticisms of what he's doing here?Story continuesLIZ HOFFMAN: I think the comparison is a little bit unfair. Wall Street was a very different place when Lloyd Blankfein was running it back in the day. David has clearly, I think, misjudged how hard it was going to be to build this consumer banking business and how long it would take for those investments to pay off. This is going to be Goldman's second best year by revenue. They're going to make somewhere $45 to $50 billion of revenue. And yet, there seemingly isn't enough to go around.And the short answer is that they spent it. And it's easy to-- I think CEOs should be investing. They should be strategic and trying to look around the corner and figure out the next big thing. But at some point, an investment with nothing to show for it is just a loss. And they are eating those now, and it's cutting into their ability to pay people.DAVE BRIGGS: Very interesting to hear in your piece you refer to Goldman Sachs as ""acting like a tech company."" If you could give us a little bit more on that analogy. And what is the next iteration of Goldman begin to act like?LIZ HOFFMAN: Yeah, the analogy is interesting, right, because Goldman had never-- you know, after the crisis, it just was-- its stock was trailing peers that were, by all accounts, kind of less interesting and profitable, places like Bank of America and JPMorgan that have these big consumer businesses, but not these huge Wall Street profits. And the upshot was that shareholders didn't want that risky investment bank anymore that was sometimes making a ton of money, but sometimes losing a ton of money. And it was very risky and hard to value and a headache to have in your portfolio.And so Goldman tried to become more like a universal bank. And the whitespace for them-- they obviously have a large investment bank, best on the Street, a very large asset management firm. And then whitespace was Main Street banking. And so they tried to fill out their portfolio and build that and become a little more balanced because shareholders wanted them to.So the comparison to tech is an interesting one because for a long time, venture capitalists, technology shareholders, wanted their companies to grow, grow, grow. To-- don't worry about making money, just get bigger. And the incentives weren't exactly the same. The path was a little bit different. But the truth is that there's a lot of pressure to go where your shareholders want you to go and where you're going to get rewarded for it in the stock price.JARED BLIKRE: Well, Liz, let me ask you here, is Goldman thinking about getting out of the consumer business altogether? Because there are a couple of different facets to that. It's not just loans. It's also deposit, deposit they would take on as liabilities from customers. And of course, that helps their balance sheet. To what degree are they thinking of just saying, all right, we tried it with the consumer, and we don't necessarily want to do this anymore?LIZ HOFFMAN: You have to remember where this started. Coming out of the financial crisis, Goldman's main problem was that its funding was bad. It was funding itself overnight and investing in long-term stuff, securities and real estate. And the best funding out there, no matter who you are, is consumer deposits. They're incredibly sticky. You can pay up a little bit to get them, and they were massively cheaper than the overnight securities-backed funding that Goldman had been relying on.So they went out in 2015 and they bought General Electric's old sort of an online deposit-taking platform. And they started raking in deposits because they were paying pretty high interest rates at a time when your checking account at Bank of America was yielding two basis points. But then the problem became, well, how do you wed those customers to the firm? Because if you're just out looking for the highest rate, you'll go to wherever the highest rate is. You don't really think of yourself as a customer of Goldman Sachs.So then they built this lending platform on the side of it that would do two things. It would try to make people feel like they actually were clients of the firm and would stick around. And then two, it was a place that you could deploy those deposits they were taking into these loans and be a nice income business. Investors would love it. And then they just got more ambitious from there, frankly.They got the Apple credit card, which, again, by all accounts, is a pretty good product. Will eventually start making money for Goldman. But again, most people who have that don't think they're customers of Goldman Sachs. They think they're customers of Apple because that's the logo on the front of the card. So they tried to, I think, really kind of duct tape together a bunch of products that might be considered like a primary banking suite, and they didn't really. And they are massively walking back from that. They'll keep the deposits. They will probably run the loan book off or lower over time.But then they carved out that what started as that Apple Card business, and they now have the General Motors card and some other point of sale financing, which they're calling platform solutions. Which is-- I mean, the way to think about it is that they tried to go directly to the consumer to have a virtual branch. It didn't work. But the one thing Goldman really does have is incredibly good relationships with corporates. So they're going to sell those through their corporate clients.DAVE BRIGGS: Interesting. Liz, we haven't talked about Elon in, like, 15 or 20 minutes. So I got to bring it back up. Apparently, a scoop from Semaphore that you are quoted on. Elon's team looking for new investors and other news. What's the latest on the Twitter dumpster fire?LIZ HOFFMAN: Yeah, so my colleague Reed Albergotti and I just put out a story right before I hopped on the air that they are looking for new equity investors into Twitter, offering them the same terms that Elon bought the company on in October. So this would be, you can come in, we'll sell you equity at 54.20 a share. They're trying to close by the end of the year. Look, my read on this is that Twitter has a lot of debt, and it's very unclear that they're going to be able to make the payments.So they're trying to get more equity into it, which will lower the debt burden. Elon himself sold about 3 and 1/2 billion dollars' worth of Tesla stock this week. Presumably, some of that will go to help stabilize Twitter. But this is a very precarious position for Twitter. They're in a ton of debt. Advertisers are fleeing the platform. They're starting to-- the product is starting to get a little problematic. So yeah, this is a whole new chapter.JARED BLIKRE: A whole new chapter, and really glad we could get in-- get that in there. So thank you for stopping by, Liz Hoffman.]"

The reductions are expected to affect 8% of the firm’s global workforce, according to Semafor; unnamed sources told the Financial Times the cuts would happen in January.In a typical year, somewhere from 2% to 5% of Goldman employees are laid off or given no bonus, as a way of culling low performers.

That’s a big number even by Wall Street’s boom-and-bust standards.Goldman competitors also increased headcount in that timeframe, but at a slower pace. JPMorgan’s workforce grew 13%, while Citigroup’s grew 17%. Perhaps that’s why layoffs at other big banks have been far less severe—CNBC reported in November that Citigroup was laying off some 50 employees, while Barclays said 200 people will be cut.datawrapper-chart-wy1zsWhy did Goldman Sach’s grow its headcount so aggressively?Goldman’s sharp headcount growth in recent years is due in part to a hiring spree in engineering talent for Marcus, its consuming-facing digital bank, as well as from various acquisitions like fintech lender GreenSky. Talent has gotten costlier, too; during the pandemic, big banks had to bump up pay to retain junior employees.Despite market volatility and a dramatic slowdown in the kinds of deals that proliferated in the pandemic, staff increases at Goldman, and at investment banks broadly, continued into the third quarter of 2022.Now though, Goldman plans on pulling back its consumer banking ambitions to reach profitability targets. Its bet on Marcus, which has been viewed skeptically by Wall Street and has yet to turn a profit, is set to cost the company billions. Goldman’s shares are down 1.4% today and have lost nearly 13% since the start of the year.Story continuesMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Schlumberger's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:17% = US$3.0b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.17 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 17% ROEAt first glance, Schlumberger seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. However, for some reason, the higher returns aren't reflected in Schlumberger's meagre five year net income growth average of 4.5%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the growth figure reported by Schlumberger compares quite favourably to the industry average, which shows a decline of 5.0% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SLB worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SLB is currently mispriced by the market.Is Schlumberger Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Schlumberger has a decent LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 28% (or a retention ratio of 72%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Schlumberger has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 27%. Regardless, the future ROE for Schlumberger is predicted to rise to 22% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Schlumberger's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

However, the positive Long-Term ICR outlook recognizes that the group’s operating performance has demonstrated a steady improving trend in more recent years, attributable to numerous underwriting and risk management initiatives, as well as continued positive pricing momentum in most key business lines.Story continuesAM Best factored into the rating decision the announcement on Dec. 14, 2022, whereby the wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, AIG Financial Products Corp., filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy.The ratings of AIG L&amp;R reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as adequate, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate ERM. AIG L&amp;R’s risk-adjusted capital position marginally improved in 2021 to the strong level, as measured by BCAR. This risk-adjusted capital position benefits from the large modified coinsurance agreement with Fortitude Reinsurance Company Ltd., which reduces much of the risk from the longer-term structured settlements book of business. The new holding company, Corebridge Financial, Inc., provides projections for leverage and coverage ratios that are within AM Best’s methodology guidelines and AIG’s statutory entities are expected to remain well-capitalized. However, AM Best notes that as the separation continues there will still be execution risk, and current projections may not materialize as planned. Additionally, longer-term reallocation of AIG L&amp;R’s investment portfolio may have an adverse impact on future risk-adjusted capital.AM Best continues to assess AIG L&amp;R segment’s operating performance as strong. While AM Best acknowledges the headwinds of strong competition within the segment, AIG L&amp;R maintains a diversified product portfolio, along with spread and fee income that is consistent with strong operating peers. AIG L&amp;R’s individual and group retirement segments continue to produce consistent returns. While its life segment reported a loss in 2020, the institutional products segment, consisting of pension risk transfer, stable value wrap, guarantee investment contracts and bank-owned/corporate-owned life insurance, has been a growing portion of the business and is likely to see continued growth.The FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of ""a"" (Excellent) have been affirmed, with the outlook for the Long-Term ICRs revised to positive from stable and the FSR outlook maintained at stable for the following P/C subsidiaries of AIG, which are collectively referred to as the AIG PC:National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PAAmerican Home Assurance CompanyLexington Insurance CompanyCommerce and Industry Insurance CompanyAIG Property Casualty CompanyThe Insurance Company of the State of PennsylvaniaNew Hampshire Insurance CompanyIllinois National Insurance CompanyAIG Specialty Insurance CompanyAIU Insurance CompanyAIG Assurance CompanyAIG Insurance Company – Puerto RicoAIG Insurance Company of CanadaAIG Insurance Hong Kong LimitedGranite State Insurance CompanyTudor Insurance CompanyStratford Insurance CompanyWestern World Insurance CompanyBlackboard Specialty Insurance CompanyBlackboard Insurance CompanyAmerican International Group UK LimitedAmerican International Reinsurance Company, Ltd.AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte.

App stores can be like that.""Story continuesPaddle, a payments processor for software companies, has built its own rival to the App Store, which it hopes to launch in Europe once the DMA comes into effect.""A 30% fee is actually fairly egregious when we look at it in comparison to how much it actually costs to process payments, and what Apple is actually offering,"" CEO Christian Owens said.Owens said Paddle's in-app payments system would charge developers between 5% and 10% on transactions.""The biggest hurdle they are going to need to overcome is the consumer,"" Wood at CCS Insight said.

""Now, after 22 years of experience in this industry, I finally feel that I have the skill set and experience to guide a Warhammer Cinematic Universe into life.""Confirmation of his involvement in the series came as it was announced on Friday that Amazon had signed a deal for the rights to Warhammer, which is owned by British company Games Workshop.Under the deal, Games Workshop will work with Amazon to develop movies and television productions, with preliminary projects focusing on expanding the “Warhammer 40,000” universe.Cavill said on Friday that his Warhammer project had ""found the perfect home at Amazon.""The series is still in the very early stages of development, with no director, writers or showrunners signed on to the project so far — but it has been confirmed that Vertigo Entertainment is attached to executive produce. Vertigo’s previous projects have included blockbusters The Departed, The Lego Movie and Don’t Worry Darling, as well as the hit TV series Lucifer.Cavill has a long professional history with beloved sci-fi and fantasy franchises, starring in several DC movies as Superman and playing the protagonist in Netflix’s epic series The Witcher.Back in October, Cavill announced his resignation from the Netflix hit within days of announcing he would be returning to play Superman. However, both Cavill and James Gunn—a filmmaker recently hired to head up DC’s movie content at Warner Bros.—said this week that executives had decided not to recast him as the iconic superhero. Despite fans hoping Cavill would return to The Witcher after being let go from the DC cinematic universe, it was confirmed this week that Netflix’s recasting of The Hunger Games star Liam Hemsworth as Geralt would still go ahead.Story continuesAmazon’s content strategyCavill’s Warhammer series will see Amazon continue its pivot toward investing heavily in streaming services.In 2021, the ecommerce behemoth spent $13 billion on film, TV and music content. This year, it bought MGM—the historic Hollywood studio behind Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz and the James Bond franchise—for $8.5 billion. Moving forward, the tech giant reportedly plans to spend more than $1 billion every year on producing movies for release in theaters.Alongside its investments in third party content, the tech giant has made an aggressive push toward producing its own original content, as it vies to compete with major players in the increasingly saturated streaming space. Those efforts have included a massive $500 million spend on the Lord of The Rings prequel series The Rings of Power.Its strategy appears to be paying off—in its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2021, the company revealed more than 200 million global Prime members had streamed TV shows and movies on its platform. In comparison, Netflix had 221.8 million subscribers worldwide by the end of last year.What is Warhammer 40,000?Securing the rights to Warhammer 40,000, also known by fans as Warhammer 40K, would allow Amazon to continue its foray into the world of major fantasy franchises.The tabletop fantasy game, which centers around a narrative set in a futuristic dystopia ravaged by war, is the most popular miniature wargame in the world. It has spawned a vast range of collectibles, novels, and videogames.Shares of London-listed Games Workshop were up almost 15% on Friday on the back of its deal with Amazon.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: People who skipped their COVID vaccine are at higher risk of traffic incidentsElon Musk says getting booed by Dave Chapelle fans 'was a first for me in real life' suggesting he's aware of building backlashGen Z and young millennials have found a new way to afford luxury handbags and watches—living with mom and dadMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Oil Refinery Stocks To Buy. Oil refining refers to the treatment of crude oil after extraction to obtain high-quality oil components that are free of any impurities. Global refined oil product markets are likely to remain constrained until mid-decade, and the global downstream sector is facing meaningful near, intermediate, and long-term challenges, as per a new report published by S&amp;P Global and the International Energy Forum. According to an Oil Refining Industry Insights report, in 2020, the global oil refining capacity declined for the first time in 20 years and this trend continued in 2021, given the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, high refinery closures, and transformations to biofuels or distribution terminals. The global oil refining market was worth $1,345 billion in 2020, and it is expected to be valued at $3,751.5 billion by 2030, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2030. The global demand for oil refining is driven by the increase in world population and consequent urbanization, expansion and upgradation of refineries to meet higher demand for oil and oil derivative products, increased aviation and transportation, and the development of emerging economies. Some of the major African countries, such as Nigeria and Algeria, are attempting to become some of the largest regional hubs for refineries in the near future. Asia-Pacific is forecasted to remain a primary player in the oil refining market, and the region accounted for about 26.3% of the total global refining output as of 2021. It is expected to remain a major region given the planned refinery projects in China and India. Some of the best oil refinery stocks to buy include Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Our Methodology We selected the following oil refinery stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.

Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to serious illness and even death.How can I prevent carbon monoxide poisoning?The most important thing you can do is properly maintain heaters, boilers, fireplaces, stoves and other gas or fuel-powered equipment.Carbon monoxide detectors are an important second line of defense.If a monitor goes off, get out of your house and call 911 immediately. Then, call the PSE&amp;G Emergency Service line at 1-800-880-7734 (PSEG).The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends placing a carbon monoxide alarm in every area of your home. If just one alarm is installed, it should be placed near the sleeping rooms of the house.Be sure to check the batteries of your carbon monoxide detector at least every six months.Other ways to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning include:Never use a gas oven or range to heat a room. This can deplete oxygen from the air and cause asphyxiation or severe carbon monoxide poisoning.Ensure that any natural-gas-burning appliances are installed, maintained and used safely and according to manufacturer instructions. Gas appliances should be checked by a qualified technician periodically to ensure that they are working properly.Do not allow vehicles, lawnmowers, snow blowers, or any gasoline-powered engine to idle in a garage attached to a house. Carbon monoxide can drift into the living space and create a hazardous situation.Never use a generator or other fuel-powered machines inside. Hazardous carbon monoxide fumes are odorless and can quickly overwhelm you if a generator is used indoors.

(NYSE:M)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-macys-inc-131418329.html,1671282858,STORY,['M'],"[Does the December share price for Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Macy's The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$562.5mUS$1.07bUS$697.5mUS$548.7mUS$470.0mUS$425.6mUS$400.0mUS$385.5mUS$378.0mUS$375.1mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -21.34%Est @ -14.34%Est @ -9.45%Est @ -6.02%Est @ -3.62%Est @ -1.94%Est @ -0.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$520US$920US$553US$402US$319US$267US$232US$207US$188US$173(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.8bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$375m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$6.3bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.3b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$2.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$6.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$20.4, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Macy's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.093. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Macy'sStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Multiline Retail market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen.Today's newsletter features my conversation with Citi's Ed Morse, one of the top energy economists and oil-market forecasters in the business.In a wide-ranging conversation, he breaks down Russia and the US, crude prices, and more.Then, I've got a full slate of weekend reads just for you, from across Insider's Pulitzer prize-winning newsroom.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here.Ed MorseCitigroupEd Morse is the global head of commodity research at Citi Group. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Phil Rosen: What will energy markets look like in 2023, and what's your oil price forecast? Ed Morse: We have an average price for Brent at the end of the year at $76 a barrel. We have WTI ending the year under $70 a barrel. Overall, there will be more market weakness.It'll be another volatile year, but not quite as volatile as 2022. There will be major uncertainty around what we call the ""fragile five"" producers: Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela. And, Russian supply is less certain than in the past.We have an underlying view that we will see an imbalance between supply and demand across 2023, with significantly more supply coming into the market than demand, leading to inventory builds, which should weigh on prices so that we see prices ending the year on average lower than the beginning.How has Russia's role in energy markets changed since it invaded Ukraine? EM: There's been a critical build up in anti-Russian sentiment in Europe, and a rethinking of that relationship, that Europe is overly dependent on Russian supplies. So we had companies — even before governments got involved — saying they were not going to import Russian oil and gas.The surge in Brent from around $85 to $125 a barrel earlier this year was not a function of supply versus demand, but a function of large distortions in the market in which the readily available supply from a close source was being shunned.Story continuesHow has the US's role changed in global energy markets this year?EM: There was a stunning impact on American oil. The US started the year as a 7-million-barrel-a-day exporter of crude products. As the year is ending, our exports have been averaging closer to 10 million barrels a day, and at times close to 11 million. The US supply system has played a really significant role in filling the gaps.And Wednesday data showed the US was exporting 1.483 million barrels a day of diesel — in other words, there's been a 91.8% increase in US exports in diesel. So US refineries are running all out, we're exporting a hell of a lot.What impact have the West's sanctions had on Russia and markets? EM: The impact of December 5 sanctions was not nearly as great as the impact of the shunning of Russian oil at the beginning of the year.But there's clear evidence that sanctions are having a punitive impact on Russia's natural gas. The argument had been that the actions had not punished Russia, and that the price of oil had gone up, and Russia was receiving more revenue than it otherwise would have. But it turned out that the drop in revenue from natural gas exports being lost to Europe had no replacement whatsoever because there was no other place to sell the gas to, so revenue from gas exports plummeted.By August, Russians felt the impact of less revenue on the natural-gas side. That's as quasi-permanent as anything can be for Russian revenue, and their plans had been to expand Russia's position in the natural gas market, not to contract it. They will never be able to replace the lost supply going to Europe. Russia simply doesn't have the technology or the ability to penetrate markets, given the reputational risk.And on the oil side, the lower prices go, as long as there's a discount on Russian crude, they get punished for it, all else equal.Should energy markets be concerned about the February sanctions on refined Russian fuels? EM: Energy markets have been very concerned about it, but their concern is slowing. The diesel market's been exceptionally tight, and the big gap in Europe's supply has been in diesel, where they have turned to Russia for most supply.But now it's the case that diesel has become more abundant.China is exporting diesel again, and may be exporting a record amount of it by the time we get to the first quarter of 2023. Supply has been building in Europe, with refineries making more diesel on their own. There's more refining capacity available in the world, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia increasing refining capacity.But the major, astonishing element really is the US, as I said earlier.Read the full feature on Ed Morse.What did you think of Morse's oil price forecast for 2023? Tweet me @philrosenn, or email me prosen@insider.com.Here's what else to read this weekend:photo of Sergey Brin and Larry Page on a neutral background with triangles in the Google colorsGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have both donated millions to charity through their foundations, but in distinctly different ways.AP; Marianne Ayala/Insider1.

Its launch of Macy’s Marketplace includes a wide range of product categories, such as pets, home, kids, baby and maternity, beauty and health, as well as toys and electronics. Management plans to expand Toys “R” Us to every Macy’s location. The company is repositioning its physical store footprint to better serve customers and support omnichannel market sales growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, Macy’s introduced 11 locations, bringing the total to 28. The company has also introduced its second Bloomie's in the Chicago land area.Macy's three-year Polaris strategy is believed to adapt better to the evolving retail ecosystem. This includes strengthening customer relationships, expansion of assortments, accelerating digital growth, optimizing store portfolio and reducing costs. Moreover, the company’s expanded Star Rewards Loyalty program, which was initiated in 2018, has been aiding better customer engagement. This was evident in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Star Rewards program members made up roughly 70% of the total Macy's brand-owned-plus-licensed sales on a trailing twelve-month basis, up approximately 5 percentage points versus the prior year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn a trailing 12-month basis, 43.6 million active customers shopped for the Macy’s brand, up 2% year over year. Roughly 4.1 million active customers shopped for the Bloomingdale’s brand, reflecting an increase of 9% from the year-ago period. About 650,000 active customers shopped for the Bluemercury brand, representing a year-over-year increase of 15%. Macy's is also aiming for around five off-mall locations in fiscal 2022, a mix of Market by Macy’s, Freestanding Backstage, Bloomie’s and Bloomingdale’s the Outlet.We note that Macy’s collaboration with the Swedish buy now, pay later group Klarna, is enabling the company to offer shoppers financial ease and payment flexibility with their online purchases. Here, shoppers can choose to pay in four equal and interest-free installments at the online checkout. The company’s tie-up with DoorDash for expedited delivery service is also encouraging. Markedly, redesigned mobile app, live shopping functionality, and addition of payment options such as Apple Pay, Klarna Express Checkout, PayPal and Venmo have been making shopping easier for customers.Macy’s has also launched a digital marketplace, featuring a collection of new brands, products and categories from third-party sellers. Also, Market by Macy's initiative plays an important role in the company’s omnichannel market ecosystem. Currently, the company operates eight Market by Macy's. To power the platform, Macy’s has partnered with Mirakl — a leading enterprise marketplace technology company. Selected third-party merchants will sell products on macys.com and bloomingdales.com.Macy’s expanded omnichannel offerings such as curbside, store pickup and same-day delivery bode well.

If you want to see more best technology stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined.As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 7.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite or simply Nasdaq, has retreated 29.44% in 2022.Of the three major indexes, the Nasdaq has decreased the most because it includes many growth stocks whose valuations have been negatively affected by the rising interest rates. Furthermore, the Nasdaq gives more weight to some big tech companies whose valuations have declined substantially this year as capital has moved from the tech sector into Treasuries given the higher yields.Federal Reserve's Interest Rate PolicyWhile October and November core inflation were lower than expected, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates next year.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, ""The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.""As for whether the increasing rates will cause a recession, Powell added, ""I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not. And if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not — it’s just not knowable.""If there is a moderate to severe recession next year, tech companies listed on the Nasdaq could face more headwinds.Tech StocksWhile many tech stocks have declined given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, some tech stocks have managed to do better than the Nasdaq for various reasons. Some tech stocks have done well this year because they have increased their earnings significantly more than expected. Other tech stocks have done well because their stocks have simply declined less than the Nasdaq given the strength of their businesses.Story continuesNevertheless, given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.booths, trade show, smau 2011, show tech, tech, people fair, milano editorial, people trade show, fair, hi tech show, exhibition, persons trade show, stands, smau, visitinAdriano Castelli / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 tech stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the Nasdaq's 29.44% decline as of December 14.

While its shares might be lower this year, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has substantial long term earnings power given how difficult it is to compete with the company in terms of making essential semiconductor production equipment.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.Like ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are technology stocks that have outperformed the NASDAQ this year.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Suggested articles:15 Countries with Lowest Interest Rates25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldTop 15 Most Advanced Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
110,1bd0b4d4-e271-3580-888b-4331f41c2e5b,GD,2022-12-17,The 7 Hottest Defense Stocks to Own for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hottest-defense-stocks-own-201223124.html,1670962343,STORY,"['BWXT', 'LMT', 'RTX', 'GD', 'AVAV', 'CAE', 'NOC']","[A year ago, the outlook was unclear for some of the hottest defense stocks. The U.S. had just pulled its troops out of Afghanistan, and analysts were pointing to a potential period of isolationism. It appeared major powers such as the U.S. might turn their focus inward for a while and withdraw from the global stage.However, Russia’s surprise invasion of Ukraine flipped everything on its head. That move made it impossible for the U.S. and its European allies to ignore their military budgets. Major powers such as Germany and Japan were forced to step up their defense spending to deter Russia and also head off potential future threats such as a possible geopolitical conflict in Taiwan. All this is to say that the situation has changed for defense stocks. Now, the industry can anticipate at least a few years of rising orders and increasing backlog as major countries rebuild and modernize their military power in the wake of the new geopolitical threats which have emerged to start the 2020s.As if that weren’t enough, there’s one more element to watch closely. The U.S. created its Space Force in 2019 to oversee defense efforts in space including maintaining GPS, communications satellites, spaceplanes, and the country’s early missile warning defense system among other functions. The expansion of space-based operations adds more upside for defense stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLMTLockheed Martin$480.50RTXRaytheon$100.41GDGeneral Dynamics$248.95BWXTBWX Technologies$59.79CAECAE Inc.$20.77NOCNorthrop Grumman$525.00AVAVAeroVironment$86.46Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comWhen investing in defense stocks, it makes sense to start with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). The company is one of the largest defense contractors in the world. It is known for its fighter jets. However, the company is also a leader in hypersonics, electronic warfare, and space and satellite systems in addition to its jets.Story continuesLMT stock is a one-stop shop for the defense industry since it has a footprint in so many different areas of the industry. Regardless of what sorts of wars or weapons systems prevail in the future, Lockheed Martin is likely to be a big part of the picture.Lockheed Martin shares are up 40% over the past year. That might lead investors to think that shares must be expensive after such a run-up. Remarkably enough, however, LMT stock is still only selling for 20 times forward earnings. That’s hardly a high price, particularly given the improving outlook for fighter jet sales given the geopolitical developments that we’ve seen this year. The company is also a solid dividend growth story. Shares yield 2.5% today and Lockheed Martin regularly gives its shareholders sizable dividend increases.Raytheon (RTX)Raytheon informational displaySource: Jordan Tan / Shutterstock.comRaytheon (NYSE:RTX), like Lockheed Martin, is another broadly diversified large defense contractor. It has operations spanning aerospace, jet engines, cybersecurity solutions, and a variety of other fields.However, the company’s missile program has arguably gotten the most attention in 2022. The company has secured a number of new and expanded orders for its National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) this year. The U.S. has transferred many of these systems to Ukraine to defend its airspace against Russian aggression.Usage has been so heavy that the U.S. has depleted much of its supply of missiles. That has led to reorders, and Raytheon is gearing up for additional production. Raytheon just secured a new $1.2 billion surface-to-air missile order earlier this month to help with operations in Ukraine.General Dynamics (GD)image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocksSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is another large defense contractor that oversees a wide range of defense products and solutions. The company’s calling card is its Columbia-class submarines. These allow the United States to project power around the world while protecting key allies. The submarine program has become increasingly important now that tensions are rising between China and Taiwan. If things escalate there, the U.S. Navy will play a key role in any potential conflicts in that sphere.The company is also a leader in information technology for governments and militaries. For one example, look at NATO. General Dynamics won the contract to upgrade the defense organization’s formerly antiquated information technology systems. Those improved capabilities came into use in 2022 as NATO played a more active role in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.General Dynamics is not a pureplay defense stock. That’s because the company generates around a quarter of its profits from its Gulfstream business jet division. That adds some uncertainty to the outlook, particularly as the economy may be heading toward a recession. However, General Dynamics has a strong overall market position, and shares are reasonably priced heading into 2023.BWX Technologies (BWXT)Source: ShutterstockFollowing up on General Dynamics, there is BWX Technologies (NYSE:BWXT). The company is a one-stop shop for all things nuclear. It makes commercial nuclear fuel, products for nuclear-based medical solutions, and various parts and components for nuclear submarines.BWX helped design and manufacture components for the USS Nautilus, which was the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine. Decades later, BWX remains a leader in the nuclear submarine field. Its reactors help power various U.S. submarines and aircraft carriers.Nuclear-powered ships are a vital asset given the current geopolitical landscape. Nuclear gives the Navy the ability to have ships run for months without having to return to port to refuel. This allows the United States more flexibility as it meets potential emerging challenges near Russia, China, and the Middle East.There’s more to BWX than just the naval business as well. Nuclear power appears to be back on the upswing. The nuclear power industry has gotten several wins, such as being included in a relief package to help plants with financial issues. With Russia’s invasion this year, energy security has become a more pressing concern. Nuclear power could serve as an ideal “bridge” solution between fossil fuels and full-on wind and solar deployments. In any case, BWXT stock has rallied this year despite the bear market. Even with shares near 52-week highs, however, they still go for a reasonable 19 times forward earnings.CAE Inc. (CAE)the cockpit of a plane with two pilots sitting in itSource: ShutterstockFor another angle at the defense industry, consider CAE (NYSE:CAE). The company produces software and simulation systems to help train airplane pilots, along with similar software for the healthcare industry to help doctors and surgeons practice various medical procedures.The aviation side has multiple tailwinds going forward. On the commercial side, there is a historic pilot shortage. This comes as many pilots retired early during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, demand for commercial travel has come roaring back, leaving the airlines facing a big shortfall in capable pilots. CAE can help fill the gap with its pilot training programs. And there’s the defense side. Look for the air forces of both the U.S. and various allies to turn to CAE to help bolster their qualified pilot pools given the rise in global unrest this year. CAE has won contracts with the likes of the German Air Force and Australian Navy this year to help train pilots and sailors.Northrop Grumman (NOC)United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.Source: viper-zero / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is a large, diversified defense contractor. The company is well-positioned with multiple programs which should benefit from the current increase in defense spending.The company’s ground-based deterrence system is part of the nuclear triad, helping to ensure that other nations do not launch nuclear strikes. It helps replace the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, which had been in service for more than 50 years. That goes to show the sort of long duration of revenues that companies can earn on their military platforms once they go live.And there’s more to Northrop Grumman. The company is developing a next-generation bomber plane that should have a similarly long life.Perhaps most excitingly, Northrop Grumman is a leader in the emerging space industry. It serves almost all facets of the industry. It helps power NASA missions, works with communications satellites, and is involved in space security efforts as well. To that point, Northrop was part of the team that powered the NASA Orion vehicle, which had just recently completed a successful lunar mission.AeroVironment (AVAV)The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comTo round out the list, there’s the company with arguably the most direct catalyst as it pertains to the war in Ukraine. That would be AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV).AeroVironment is a specialist in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The company has two primary offerings. It makes UAS vehicles that allow an army to get superior knowledge of what’s going on in an enemy battlefield or region. AeroVironment’s vehicles provide the user with tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance of an area without putting human lives at risk.The company also makes its Switchblade tactical missile system. These drones allow the United States and its allies to operate their missile units more efficiently than ever before. AeroVironment is proud of its efforts to help the Ukrainian resistance, stating that: “Our loitering missiles and UAS give Ukraine an unfair advantage.” When historians look back at why the war went so much better for Ukraine than initially expected, AeroVironment may play a key role in that recounting.The outlook for AeroVironment is strong. The company’s unmanned vehicles have been particularly useful in the Ukraine theater as the west tries to avoid putting any direct boots on the ground. AeroVironment’s solutions have helped Ukraine fight without provoking Russia to further escalation. On top of that, look for more orders from the U.S. and its allies going forward as countries build their deterrent forces to try to dissuade bad actors from making invasions in the future.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BWXT, RTX, and LMT stock.

The Fed categorically mentioned that market pundits shouldn’t expect the central bank to halt interest rate increases anytime soon since more work needs to be done to curb inflation, which is running close to a 40-year high.The Fed acknowledged that the pace of increase in U.S. consumer prices may have slowed down in November, but it’s still way more than the central bank’s target range. In fact, the central bank, this week, hiked interest rate by 0.50 percentage points following a slew of four successive three-quarter point rate increases this year in an attempt to slow inflation.However, such monetary tightening measures increased auto loans, variable-rate loans, and the cost of credit cards, something that doesn’t bode well for the economy.What’s more, the Fed is only keen to alter its monetary policy stance if inflation declines in a sustainable fashion, which looks like a distant dream as of now. That means consumers’ propensity to spend will decline over the course of time, eventually tipping the economy into a recession.Consumers, in reality, have already started to spend less. Last month, sales at U.S. retailers declined 0.6% compared to the prior month, its biggest decline in 2022, per the Commerce Department. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that manufacturing activity in its region contracted more than anticipated.Thus, with budget-conscious shoppers curtailing holiday-related purchases and manufacturing activity weakening, the economy has started to show signs of slowing down and stocks have begun to plummet. The Dow finished its worst day in the last three months on Dec 15, while the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-laden Nasdaq too stretched their December losses.Investors, however, shouldn’t freak out! Despite a broader market selloff, there are stocks that tend to do well during economic downturns. Notable among them are defensive stocks. Their business performances aren’t correlated with happenings in the larger market, or in other words, they are non-cyclical in nature.Story continuesProminent among them are utilities and consumer staple companies. The demand for their products and services remains unperturbed by market volatility. And why not? Utilities include gas, water, and electricity, which are undoubtedly essentials. Staples, on the other hand, mostly includes food companies whose demand continues to remain unaltered under any circumstances.We have, thus, selected three stocks from the aforesaid areas whose defensive nature makes them recession-proof. These stocks presently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.NextEra Energy NEE is a public utility holding company engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. The premier U.S. utility service provider’s strong investment plan and adequate liquidity will boost its performance in the near future.NextEra Energy, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.4% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.7%. It’s projected earnings growth rate for the next year is 8.3%.Alliant Energy LNT is a holding company with subsidiaries engaged in regulated electric and natural gas services.

(NASDAQ:PDCO) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.26 per share on the 3rd of February. This means the annual payment is 3.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies Patterson Companies' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Patterson Companies' earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 13.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 45% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendPatterson Companies Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.56 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.04. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.4% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Patterson Companies May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, Patterson Companies has only grown its earnings per share at 3.7% per annum over the past five years. Growth of 3.7% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either.In SummaryIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Patterson Companies' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think Patterson Companies is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

The company recorded currency-adjusted revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. The trend is expected to continue. However, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has dropped 5.1% compared with a 12.7% fall of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 17.5% decline.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.8 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to continue their strong growth for the next five years at an annual rate of 6.9%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 7.88%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are expected to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Per a report by Verified Market Research, the dental equipment market was valued at $7.41 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $10.25 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of approximately 4.8%. Sales in this segment were up 1.1% year over year during second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Story continuesSolid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: Patterson Companies' growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management at Patterson Companies expects solid margin improvement in the Animal Health unit through stronger partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The company’s companion animal and production animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. The company is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well-poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered internal sales growth of 0.7%, owing to sustained strength in the production animal business. The Animal Health segment delivered gross margin and operating margin improvement in the quarter under review on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software and a team focused on expense discipline.DownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition from other national and full-service firms and at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level besides hundreds of small local distributors. PDCO needs to introduce products to withstand competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings in fiscal 2023 gained from $2.27 to $2.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.62 billion, suggesting a 1.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Patterson Companies, Inc.

I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen.Today's newsletter features my conversation with Citi's Ed Morse, one of the top energy economists and oil-market forecasters in the business.In a wide-ranging conversation, he breaks down Russia and the US, crude prices, and more.Then, I've got a full slate of weekend reads just for you, from across Insider's Pulitzer prize-winning newsroom.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here.Ed MorseCitigroupEd Morse is the global head of commodity research at Citi Group. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Phil Rosen: What will energy markets look like in 2023, and what's your oil price forecast? Ed Morse: We have an average price for Brent at the end of the year at $76 a barrel. We have WTI ending the year under $70 a barrel. Overall, there will be more market weakness.It'll be another volatile year, but not quite as volatile as 2022. There will be major uncertainty around what we call the ""fragile five"" producers: Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela. And, Russian supply is less certain than in the past.We have an underlying view that we will see an imbalance between supply and demand across 2023, with significantly more supply coming into the market than demand, leading to inventory builds, which should weigh on prices so that we see prices ending the year on average lower than the beginning.How has Russia's role in energy markets changed since it invaded Ukraine? EM: There's been a critical build up in anti-Russian sentiment in Europe, and a rethinking of that relationship, that Europe is overly dependent on Russian supplies. So we had companies — even before governments got involved — saying they were not going to import Russian oil and gas.The surge in Brent from around $85 to $125 a barrel earlier this year was not a function of supply versus demand, but a function of large distortions in the market in which the readily available supply from a close source was being shunned.Story continuesHow has the US's role changed in global energy markets this year?EM: There was a stunning impact on American oil. The US started the year as a 7-million-barrel-a-day exporter of crude products. As the year is ending, our exports have been averaging closer to 10 million barrels a day, and at times close to 11 million. The US supply system has played a really significant role in filling the gaps.And Wednesday data showed the US was exporting 1.483 million barrels a day of diesel — in other words, there's been a 91.8% increase in US exports in diesel. So US refineries are running all out, we're exporting a hell of a lot.What impact have the West's sanctions had on Russia and markets? EM: The impact of December 5 sanctions was not nearly as great as the impact of the shunning of Russian oil at the beginning of the year.But there's clear evidence that sanctions are having a punitive impact on Russia's natural gas. The argument had been that the actions had not punished Russia, and that the price of oil had gone up, and Russia was receiving more revenue than it otherwise would have. But it turned out that the drop in revenue from natural gas exports being lost to Europe had no replacement whatsoever because there was no other place to sell the gas to, so revenue from gas exports plummeted.By August, Russians felt the impact of less revenue on the natural-gas side. That's as quasi-permanent as anything can be for Russian revenue, and their plans had been to expand Russia's position in the natural gas market, not to contract it. They will never be able to replace the lost supply going to Europe. Russia simply doesn't have the technology or the ability to penetrate markets, given the reputational risk.And on the oil side, the lower prices go, as long as there's a discount on Russian crude, they get punished for it, all else equal.Should energy markets be concerned about the February sanctions on refined Russian fuels? EM: Energy markets have been very concerned about it, but their concern is slowing. The diesel market's been exceptionally tight, and the big gap in Europe's supply has been in diesel, where they have turned to Russia for most supply.But now it's the case that diesel has become more abundant.China is exporting diesel again, and may be exporting a record amount of it by the time we get to the first quarter of 2023. Supply has been building in Europe, with refineries making more diesel on their own. There's more refining capacity available in the world, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia increasing refining capacity.But the major, astonishing element really is the US, as I said earlier.Read the full feature on Ed Morse.What did you think of Morse's oil price forecast for 2023? Tweet me @philrosenn, or email me prosen@insider.com.Here's what else to read this weekend:photo of Sergey Brin and Larry Page on a neutral background with triangles in the Google colorsGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have both donated millions to charity through their foundations, but in distinctly different ways.AP; Marianne Ayala/Insider1.

AAPL - Apple Pay in Kuwait. The benefits of the launch can be reaped by MA’s cardholders across the country.With an easy set-up process and the consequent addition of Mastercard credit or debit cards on iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac, Apple Pay will equip cardholders to engage in seamless and secure digital payments. All they need to do is place their Apple devices within close proximity of a payment terminal that accepts Mastercard contactless payments.Mastercard is offering the opportunity to its Kuwait cardholders to use Apple Pay while purchasing a wide variety of commodities at diversified places including grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants, coffee shops, online stores and parking to name a few.Apple Pay ensures each of the transactions is carried out safely by alloting and storing a unique Device Account Number in the Secure Element. The Secure Element, an industry-standard, certified chip, was devised for the safe storage of payment information on a device. This facility of not storing card information directly on the device or on Apple servers eliminates the chances of compromising the consumers’ confidential data.Apart from benefiting consumers, payment services like Apple Pay seem to be of great use to merchants as well. The security feature injected within Apple Pay might save merchants from incurring huge losses in case of fraudulent transactions, which often occur due to the widespread adoption of digital payments.The recent decision to launch Apple Wallet in Kuwait reflects Mastercard’s efforts to offer expanded digital payment options to simplify the daily payments of the country’s consumers and gradually move toward a cashless society. The move also indicates MA’s target to occupy a significant share of the rapidly-growing digital payments market in the country. It is also likely to generate higher revenues for Mastercard as usage of Apple Pay, which ensures secure transactions, will attract more customers to engage in the increased usage of Mastercard-branded cards during transactions.Story continuesThe broader motive of Mastercard in establishing a strong presence across any of the Middle East countries can be clearly reflected through the latest move. The Middle East continues to witness a booming digital economy driven by factors such as increased Internet penetration and higher usage of smartphones.

125,7cd74b4b-1d57-3514-abc8-a456e04b77cd,MA,2022-12-17,4 Gold Stocks to Watch in a Promising Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-gold-stocks-watch-promising-143502080.html,1671201302,STORY,"['SI=F', 'GC=F', 'FNV', 'AU', '^GSPC', 'AEM']","[The prospects for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry look bright at the moment on the back of improving gold prices. The yellow metal is likely to gain next year on improving demand, fears of a recession and geopolitical tensions.With gold prices anticipated to gain further on demand-supply imbalance, companies like Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV, Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, AngloGold Ashanti AU and Galiano Gold Inc. GAU are well-poised for growth, backed by their strong balance sheets, efforts to lower costs and growth initiatives.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Gold industry mainly comprises companies engaged in extracting gold from mines. The mines may be either underground or open pits. Mining is a long and complex process, and requires significant financial resources. It involves exploration to evaluate the deposit's size, followed by assessing ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, and, finally, develop the mine before the actual mining process. It normally takes 10-20 years for a gold mine to produce material that can finally be refined. The players in the industry nowadays use a range of sophisticated techniques to extract gold and convert it into dore bars, an alloy of gold and silver, alongside other impurities. These are then sent for purification, following which gold is purchased in the forms of bars or coins or used in jewelry or for other purposes.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Gold IndustryGold Prices Regain Ground: The yellow metal started this year on a strong note, hitting a high of $2,078.70 an ounce in the first week of March. However, it soon lost steam as the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018 to tame the mounting inflation. Since then, for a major part of 2022, gold prices remained under pressure (even dropped to as low as $1,618 an ounce) due to monetary tightening by central banks around the world. Gold prices have, however, regained ground lately. It crossed the $1,700 an ounce mark in November as the Fed meeting that month signaled a likelihood of a slowdown of rate hikes. Gold rose 7% in November, breaking the seven-month decline stint. So far in December, gold has gained 2% and peaked at $1,836.90 an ounce on Dec 13, following the release of the lower-than-expected U.S. annual inflation figures. Gold has since steadied, closing at $1,787.80 an ounce on Dec 15, as the Fed offered a more hawkish outlook on its policy than markets anticipated. At its last meeting, the Fed delivered a smaller half percentage point rate hike but projected a terminal rate of 5.1% next year, higher than previously stated. While rate hikes pose challenges to gold, continued geopolitical risks and fears of recession will likely drive the demand for gold as a hedge.Story continuesLabor Issues, High Costs Persist: The industry continues to face a shortage of skilled workforce, causing a spike in wages. The industry players are persistently grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control gold prices, it focuses on improving sales volume and operating cash flow, and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources, such as solar or wind farms, to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.India and China to Support Demand: India and China together account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. A pick-up in demand in China is expected next year, aided by fewer COVID disruptions, a cautious economic rebound and a gradual pick-up in consumer confidence. Retail demand in India is expected to improve on improved consumer confidence and pent-up demand. The demand for physical gold is seasonally higher in the later part of the year, aided by the festival and wedding season in India.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance to Support Prices: Depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines remain inherent threats to the industry. Due to the scarcity of discoveries and exhaustive existing resources, miners prefer building up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging new ones that are inherently risky and capital-intensive. On the demand side, the use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology is rising. The yellow metal has long been considered a safe-haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty. So, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices. This bodes well for the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Mining - Gold Industry, which is a 39-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it at the top 39% of 248 Zacks industries.

Smee2022 has been an exciting year for mobile communications. Not only was the third 5G standard - 3GPP Release 17 - successfully completed bringing many 5G innovations, but the work on 5G Advanced has also officially begun. Through the rest of this decade, 5G Advanced will continue to improve end-to-end system performance, bring new efficiencies, and proliferate 5G into more devices and use cases. More importantly, 5G Advanced is establishing the technical foundation for 6G - the next-generation mobile platform coming in 2030 and beyond.Today, the early vision for 6G is starting to emerge as mobile and the broader vertical ecosystems embark on foundational technology research preparing for the next decade of innovations. While we are still quite a few years away from commercial launches of the 6G platform, we are certain of one thing: 6G will bring technology leaps, new experiences, and use cases that we can barely imagine today.6G motivations, capabilities, and applicationsSo, why will we need 6G? At a high level, there are three main driving forces: harnessing core technology advancements (in wireless and adjacent areas like semiconductors and materials science), meeting societal sustainability needs (economic growth, digital access, and green initiatives), and addressing new requirements for next-level experiences that cannot be met with 5G.To efficiently meet these objectives, 6G will be a smarter platform that brings more than just a new radio design, it is envisioned to encompass a broader range of technologies to further drive the expansion of the connected intelligent edge at scale. 6G will fully unleash the combined potential of communications, artificial intelligence (AI), integrated sensing, system resiliency, and greener networks.For use cases, 6G will evolve fixed and mobile broadband to support expanded capacity and higher speed. Pervasive access can provide ubiquitous connectivity, and real-time control will further enhance ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication. 6G will also deliver new classes of services, serving as a unified platform that can take human immersion to the next level. Advanced sensing will enable spatial perception services to further improve communication and enable new applications. Building on that technology progress, the 6G platform is expected to realize a broad set of industrial and societal benefits, further expanding the digital economy and delivering on improved sustainability.Story continuesEssential technology vectors on the path to 6GToday at Qualcomm Technologies, we are driving longer-term research across a wide range of technical disciplines to lead the 5G Advanced evolution and establish the technical foundation for 6G. Let me summarize our key technology vectors.Merging of the worlds: Future innovations can unlock more immersive experiences. We are rapidly pushing technology boundaries to take human augmentation to the next-level and more seamlessly merge the physical, digital, and virtual worlds. On the path to 6G, we will further enhance boundless XR, and tactile Internet, as well as enable low-power joint communications and sensing, and more.AI-native end-to-end communications and sensing: A data-driven design will distribute AI throughout all protocols and layers, allowing the 6G system to efficiently improve as more data is collected. Key technologies can facilitate joint training, model sharing, and distributed inference across networks and devices, including federated learning that scales fully with 6G.Scalable network architecture: Next-generation systems will bring processing capabilities even closer to the end user by disaggregating and distributing cloud processing across the connected intelligent edge. It is expected to serve broader application needs and further enhance open RAN (O-RAN) topologies with disaggregation and virtualization for more scalable, cost-effective, and adaptable networks.Air interface innovations: A cutting-edge air interface design can deliver significant performance leaps in existing and new spectrum. Fundamental building blocks (waveforms, multiple access, channel coding) will need to address the exponential data growth with sustainable complexity and power efficiency. Example areas include full duplex, Giga-MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and more.Expanding into new spectrum bands: A new spectrum paradigm can bring new spectrum and enable novel sharing and dynamic coordination techniques that better utilize existing spectrum. Opening upper mid-band (i.e., 7 to 24 GHz) and sub-THz band (beyond 100 GHz) can enable new use cases and deployments that require extreme capacity.Communications resiliency: From cloud to network to device, there is an increasing need to support a higher degree of resilience in terms of security, privacy, availability, and more. Next-generation systems will build on a solid foundation to further enhance resiliency in anticipation of future challenges. Potential focus includes new and enhanced trust models, such as support for post-quantum security.There is a lot of work ahead of us to drive 5G Advanced evolution forward on the path to 6G. I look forward to providing additional updates at our annual technology showcase at MWC Barcelona 2023.

If you want to see more cheap stocks to buy that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.A cheap stock is a stock of a company that's trading for below its intrinsic value.Given that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined in 2022 and many cheap stocks have become even cheaper this year as their valuations have decreased.In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 7.16%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 29.44% in 2022 as of December 14.As a result of the market decline, there are many stocks that trade for relatively low forward P/E ratios. If there is a recession next year, some of the stocks with the low forward P/E ratios might not look as cheap because many companies might not earn as much as analyst estimates. If companies miss earnings substantially and lower their outlooks, analyst earnings for the future could come down and their forward P/E ratios could go higher.Given forward P/E ratios are not very dependable if companies miss their estimates, some investors use analyst price targets in addition to identifying stocks with competitive advantages to decide whether a stock is cheap or not.2022While the market has declined this year, some cheap stocks have outperformed the broader market for various reasons. Some cheap stocks have experienced strong growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. Other cheap stocks have declined less given the strength and stability of their businesses.As for the future, it remains to be seen whether there will be an economic slowdown in 2023. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022, we picked stocks with substantial competitive advantages that either trade below the average analyst price target or trade for below their intrinsic values.We then filtered the stocks to ensure that they outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date as of December 14.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 202212. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 20.03%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35While the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7%, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) has surged 20.03% in 2022 given strong earnings. For Q3, the global aerospace and defense company earned $3.26 per share on sales of $10 billion versus the consensus of $3.15 per share on revenue of $9.92 billion. Analysts see more upside in the future given the average target price of $271.25 per share.Alongside Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a cheap stock that has outperformed the market in 2022.11. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 3.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37In terms of 2022 when all three major indexes have declined, Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has done relatively well with a rally of 3.78%. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) is considered a defensive stock given its retail stores sell low cost products.Given the high inflation this year, demand for Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has increased. In Q3 2022, the company's consolidated net sales rose 8.1% year over year to $6.94 billion and its diluted earnings per share increased 25% year over year to $1.20.Considering the quality of its business, analysts like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) as they have an average price target of $165.36 per share. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 37 owned shares of Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) at the end of September, ranking the stock #11 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 10.16%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best performing tech stocks of the year given its 10.16% rally in 2022 as of December 14. Although the stock actually trades slightly higher than the average analyst price target of $141.66 per share, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has substantial long term intrinsic value given its earnings power. If it can succeed in quantum computing, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) would be even more attractive as well.40 hedge funds in our database owned shares of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #10 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.9. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 9.27%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) has rallied 9.27% this year while the broader market has declined given the railroad company's strong earnings results. For Q3, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 and total sales rose 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Analysts have an average price target of $81.86 per share.Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an August investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -1.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Although its stock hasn't done well in the last five years, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) nevertheless outperformed the market in 2022 given its decline of 1.51% versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% year to date. One reason could be AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)'s valuation with its forward P/E ratio of 7.18 as of December 15, which is pretty attractive if the telecom can earn what analysts expect.In terms of expectations, analysts estimate AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) will earn $2.60 per share in 2022, $2.54 per share in 2023, and $2.60 per share in 2024.7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -6.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67The average analyst thinks there's upside in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) despite the stock of the enterprise software company declining 6.92% year to date. In terms of average estimates, analysts have a price target of $87.25 per share and they estimate Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will earn $4.88 per share in 2023, $5.55 per share in 2024, and $6.33 per share in 2025.67 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #7 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 1.40%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares have rallied 1.4% this year, easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% in the same period. Although inflation has been a headwind for a lot of companies this year, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been able to arguably benefit from it by gaining more customers with its low retail prices.Analysts like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) as they have an average price target of $160.50 per share.Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc.

140,0b2f38bc-d28a-3fd5-91dc-afc1738a2b29,MDT,2022-12-17,Are Poor Financial Prospects Dragging Down Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/poor-financial-prospects-dragging-down-110049269.html,1671274849,STORY,['MDT'],"[With its stock down 15% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Medtronic's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:8.3% = US$4.3b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROEOn the face of it, Medtronic's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. Thus, the low net income growth of 4.9% seen by Medtronic over the past five years could probably be the result of the low ROE.Story continuesWe then compared Medtronic's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 17% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is MDT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Medtronic Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Medtronic has a three-year median payout ratio of 68% (implying that it keeps only 32% of its profits), meaning that it pays out most of its profits to shareholders as dividends, and as a result, the company has seen low earnings growth.Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 51% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 14% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Medtronic. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(NYSE:MRK) Trading At A 43% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-nyse-mrk-120021384.html,1671278421,STORY,['MRK'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Merck The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$17.8bUS$19.5bUS$21.4bUS$22.3bUS$23.1bUS$23.7bUS$24.4bUS$25.0bUS$25.5bUS$26.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x4Est @ 3.29%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.62%Est @ 2.43%Est @ 2.29%Est @ 2.20% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$16.7kUS$17.3kUS$17.8kUS$17.4kUS$16.9kUS$16.3kUS$15.7kUS$15.1kUS$14.6kUS$14.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$162bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$26b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$597bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$597b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$320bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$482b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$109, the company appears quite good value at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Merck as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MerckStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Merck, there are three relevant factors you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - Merck has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does MRK's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to see more best technology stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined.As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 7.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite or simply Nasdaq, has retreated 29.44% in 2022.Of the three major indexes, the Nasdaq has decreased the most because it includes many growth stocks whose valuations have been negatively affected by the rising interest rates. Furthermore, the Nasdaq gives more weight to some big tech companies whose valuations have declined substantially this year as capital has moved from the tech sector into Treasuries given the higher yields.Federal Reserve's Interest Rate PolicyWhile October and November core inflation were lower than expected, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates next year.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, ""The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.""As for whether the increasing rates will cause a recession, Powell added, ""I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not. And if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not — it’s just not knowable.""If there is a moderate to severe recession next year, tech companies listed on the Nasdaq could face more headwinds.Tech StocksWhile many tech stocks have declined given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, some tech stocks have managed to do better than the Nasdaq for various reasons. Some tech stocks have done well this year because they have increased their earnings significantly more than expected. Other tech stocks have done well because their stocks have simply declined less than the Nasdaq given the strength of their businesses.Story continuesNevertheless, given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.booths, trade show, smau 2011, show tech, tech, people fair, milano editorial, people trade show, fair, hi tech show, exhibition, persons trade show, stands, smau, visitinAdriano Castelli / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 tech stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the Nasdaq's 29.44% decline as of December 14.

While its shares might be lower this year, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has substantial long term earnings power given how difficult it is to compete with the company in terms of making essential semiconductor production equipment.Baron Opportunity Fund commented on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.Like ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are technology stocks that have outperformed the NASDAQ this year.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Suggested articles:15 Countries with Lowest Interest Rates25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldTop 15 Most Advanced Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So far there are no signs of a settlement.French President Emmanuel Macron was welcomed at Doha airport on his arrival for Wednesday's semi-final by officials including Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, Qatar News Agency reported. He will also attend Sunday's final.The welcome by Al Baker in his capacity as minister of tourism is seen as a signal that the dispute is between companies rather than affecting strong diplomatic ties, though some diplomats have said politics may weigh on the outcome.Reuters reported last month that the dispute had risen to the attention of French and Qatari leaders, who discussed the issue last December during a previous visit by Macron to Doha.""Every time there is contact there is an opportunity to improve the atmosphere,"" one person familiar with the case said, though others cautioned the two sides remain far apart.Qatar Airways says widespread paint cracking has exposed deeper surface damage on the jets, prompting it to stop taking deliveries. Qatar's national regulator also progressively grounded at least 29 jets on safety concerns over the past year.Story continuesAirbus has acknowledged quality problems with its premier long-haul model but denies any risk to safety and has cancelled all outstanding new business with Qatar Airways, which has increased purchases from rival Boeing.Friday's hearing is expected to focus on the timing and workload of what amounts to a corporate divorce trial, with the judge appealing to both sides on Friday to narrow the issues and Airbus calling for the trial to be split into two parts.The two sides are also feuding over relations with regulators and access to documents, with Boeing weighing in to restrict its arch-rival's access to contracts and maintenance records.

Illumina could raise prices or withhold the technology competing test developers need to thrive.But Reuters interviews with 13 cancer researchers, genomics experts and potential competitors to Grail and Illumina show the field of winners and losers among early detection cancer test makers is still far from decided, suggesting the $7.1 billion deal won't strengthen Grail's hand as much as regulators fear.In court documents, competition enforcers cite concerns from Grail rivals about being disadvantaged by the tie-up.Exact Sciences Corp and six other companies testified in the U.S. that they relied on Illumina's system.

155,8ecf0141-b079-3b1a-8e42-3bcdd8814174,MAA,2022-12-17,3 REITs With Recent Dividend Hikes to Help Survive Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-recent-dividend-hikes-132101468.html,1671196861,STORY,"['O', 'ARE', 'MAA-PI']","[Are you are planning to pour your hard-earned money into the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, or have already invested in it? Then you must be worried about the recent 50 basis point hike in the benchmark interest rate this week by the Federal Reserve and the indication that the rates might be kept higher for an extended period of time.However, rather than worrying, a focus on the unique feature of this distinct asset class can fetch you a steady income and help to survive market volatility.In fact, with the roller coaster ride in the stock market this year — thanks to high inflation and a quick rise in interest rates that is weighing on asset prices — the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors.Income-seeking investors still have a large appetite for REIT stocks, as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Ushering in good news for investors, particularly income-seeking ones, recently, a number of REITs declared their dividend hikes. Among them are Realty Income Corporation O, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA.What’s more to drive you to invest in REITs?What’s more encouraging is REITs’ characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth.This hybrid asset class not only provides protection against inflation but also benefits from the improving fundamentals of the underlying asset categories as well as the location of properties. In fact, with the waning of the pandemic-related concerns, REITs, which invest in all types of properties, from residential, industrial, offices and malls to hospitals, hotels, data centers and several others, are experiencing an improvement in a number of these asset categories.Also, according to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs’ operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations and net operating income, respectively.Story continuesAs REITs continue to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now, if REITs’ historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Let’s discuss these REIT stocks in detail:Headquartered in San Diego, CA, Realty Income is engaged in the acquisition and management of freestanding commercial properties that reap rental revenues under long-term net lease agreements with commercial clients.

It derives more than 90% of its annualized retail contractual rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and a low-price-point component to their business.Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing and provide more reliable streams of income.

The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life science markets.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Looking at the company’s solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.Mid-America Apartment Communities, also known as MAA and based in Germantown, TN, is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

QuoteMAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio of suburban-focused communities was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and population inflow into the company’s markets as renters sought more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities.Amid these, MAA is poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared with expensive coastal markets. MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Looking at its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), it seems that its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this deal, Germany becomes the ninth foreign military sales (FMS) country to include F-35 in its family of aircraft.Per the deal, LMT will deliver 35 F-35 Lightning II jets to Germany to meet the country’s defense requirements. The United States has been backing the European countries for their security and defense needs for many years, with the aforementioned agreement strengthening America’s alliance with the European countries.The agreement also entails the delivery of a comprehensive package of engines, role-specific mission equipment, spare and replacement parts, technical and logistic support, training and armament requirements.F-35 to Continue Boosting LMT’s Growth ProspectsF-35 has been dominating the military aircraft arena for many years. It is anticipated to be the top choice for military missions in the years to come, backed by its super-advanced technology.F-35 is a multi-role fighter capable of successfully executing any kind of mission, including new missions not traditionally fulfilled by legacy fighters. Additionally, its ability to collect, analyze and share data is a powerful force multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battlespace.Such features have made the aircraft the most desirable choice for many nations. Apart from eight international program partners, F-35 is being procured by eight other FMS customers. Prior to Germany, Switzerland joined the consortium of FMS customers in 2022.F-35 is expected to continue to top the list of military aircraft demand for many years to come as the U.S. Government boasts a current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy, commitments from seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers and interests from other countries.Story continuesThe strong demand can also be gauged by a solid backlog of 271 production aircraft at the end of the third quarter of 2022, which will continue to augment the top line of the company. With nations increasing their defense spending to strengthen their defense structure, F-35 may witness more nations joining the program, thus adding to its wide prospects of intensified demand.Peers to BenefitDefense majors that play a critical role in manufacturing the stealth aircraft and are thus likely to benefit from the strong demand are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC plays a critical role in the development, demonstration, production and sustainment of F-35.

If you want to see more best technology stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined.As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 7.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite or simply Nasdaq, has retreated 29.44% in 2022.Of the three major indexes, the Nasdaq has decreased the most because it includes many growth stocks whose valuations have been negatively affected by the rising interest rates. Furthermore, the Nasdaq gives more weight to some big tech companies whose valuations have declined substantially this year as capital has moved from the tech sector into Treasuries given the higher yields.Federal Reserve's Interest Rate PolicyWhile October and November core inflation were lower than expected, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates next year.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, ""The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.""As for whether the increasing rates will cause a recession, Powell added, ""I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not. And if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not — it’s just not knowable.""If there is a moderate to severe recession next year, tech companies listed on the Nasdaq could face more headwinds.Tech StocksWhile many tech stocks have declined given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, some tech stocks have managed to do better than the Nasdaq for various reasons. Some tech stocks have done well this year because they have increased their earnings significantly more than expected. Other tech stocks have done well because their stocks have simply declined less than the Nasdaq given the strength of their businesses.Story continuesNevertheless, given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.booths, trade show, smau 2011, show tech, tech, people fair, milano editorial, people trade show, fair, hi tech show, exhibition, persons trade show, stands, smau, visitinAdriano Castelli / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 tech stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the Nasdaq's 29.44% decline as of December 14.

It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.Like ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are technology stocks that have outperformed the NASDAQ this year.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Suggested articles:15 Countries with Lowest Interest Rates25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldTop 15 Most Advanced Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $619.1 million, the contract is projected to get completed by October 2030. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will supply long-lead materials, parts and components for the 17th lot’s F135 propulsion systems to support the F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract also entails the production and delivery of four F135-PW-600 propulsion systems to support F-35 jets.The deal will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-U.S. Department of Defense partners and Foreign Military Sales (“FMS”) customers. A major portion of the work related to this contract will be executed in Windsor Locks, CT, and Indianapolis, IN.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena and witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed Martin delivered 841 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 271 jets in the backlog as of September 2022. The strong international demand for F-35 in the first three quarters of 2022 resulted in multiple order wins for LMT and RTX.Further, the production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for many years ahead, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, may expect to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster this defense contractor’s top line.Story continuesPeer GrowthApart from Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

(NYSE:NKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-nike-inc-120029443.html,1671278429,STORY,['NKE'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for NIKE The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.20bUS$5.73bUS$7.21bUS$7.51bUS$9.20bUS$10.2bUS$11.0bUS$11.7bUS$12.3bUS$12.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 10.72%Est @ 8.09%Est @ 6.26%Est @ 4.98%Est @ 4.08% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$3.9kUS$4.9kUS$5.7kUS$5.5kUS$6.2kUS$6.3kUS$6.3kUS$6.2kUS$6.0kUS$5.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$57bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$210bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$210b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$95bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$152b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$106, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.117. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NIKEStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

The company also reported a 22% decrease in net income of $1.5 billion due to elevated freight and logistics costs, as well as higher markdowns in the Nike Direct business.More from Footwear NewsKansas City Chiefs Kicker Harrison Butker Wears Nike and Adidas Cleats at the Same Time During Super Bowl 57Jennifer Lopez Casually Runs Errands in Cream Sweats and Air Jordan SneakersBella Hadid Mixes Camo T-Shirt &amp; Plaid Jacket With Nike x CDG Air Foamposite SneakersGiven the expected inventory clearing headwinds, analysts were cautious about the stock, noting that Nike’s short-term performance could likely take a hit.In a note to investors, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser said to “remain on the sidelines due to ongoing lack of visibility” for fiscal year 2023. Weak sales in Nike’s basketball and the Air Max division and a highly competitive promotional environment will also impact results this quarter as well, Poser noted, adding that management will likely have a clearer view on the marketplace after the third quarter as inventory clears and sales in China recover.Despite the expected headwinds, analysts don’t expect a completely devastating quarter for Nike. According to a note from Morgan Stanley analysts, a hit to EPS or GM in Q2 wouldn’t be crushing, especially if it means Nike is able to move through its inventory excesses and come out lighter than last quarter. This would position the company well for the future.“We expect Nike likely takes advantage of potentially stronger-than-expected North American sportswear demand to clear through excess apparel inventories,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. “Even if a 2Q EPS beat fails to materialize as a result of deeper discounting-related GM pressure, we do not necessarily view that as a negative for the stock.”Story continuesNike will also be entering the holiday season with a few tailwinds. After Adidas cut ties with Kanye “Ye” West and the Yeezy brand in late October, the absence of Yeezy products in the marketplace this year will leave its former market share up for grabs, with Nike emerging as the most likely brand to win it over.Yeezy sales have typically peaked in December. As Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic pointed out in a Monday note, there were 10 Yeezy launches in December of last year, out of about 65 total launches over the year, “demonstrating how concentrated the brand had become to December.”Throughout December, Nikic expects to see 26 high heat launches from Nike. The lack of competition from the Yeezy brand will likely prompt stronger demand for these releases, as well as lower-tiered Nike products as well.]"

Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani has been following this closely. Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Brian. So we know, of course, that China rolled back a lot of its restrictions, including lockdowns of neighborhoods and cities. And what that has resulted in is, not unexpectedly, a labor shortage in a lot of locations, not being able to mitigate the transmission in areas. Though, to be fair, China is also facing a very transmissive Omicron subvariant right now.And so all of that put together really leads to the tale of really what we saw here in the US some time back. And it could spell trouble for the winter ahead for China, as we're looking at the potential of yet another wave. They've already sort of been in the middle of one. We saw cases rise, but with a reduction of tests and testing sites, but the increase of fever clinics, there's some guesswork as to actually how many cases they are currently seeing and what the severity is as of right now. So keeping an eye on that.Meanwhile, of course, keeping a track of all the vaccine information here in the US, Pfizer just got fast track approval for its COVID and flu combo vaccine. And that is compared to Moderna and Novavax, also in the race for similar ones. Novavax said it should be also applying for fast track approval later on. Moderna unclear yet. So it's going to be interesting. We might have yet another COVID vaccine race.BRIAN SOZZI: Interesting. And also interesting, Anjalee, tracking shares of Guardant Health. Not a name we usually talk about here, but down about 30% or so here.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So Guardant Health, they are developing a blood cancer-- a colorectal blood cancer test. And the results that came out were just shy of what analysts were expecting. They were looking at an 85% sensitivity. By comparison, the result came out as 83%. Now I'd like to point out that there's another one that JPM pointed to, which has already on the market, already got FDA approval, with 68% sensitivity. So if you do a comparison side by side, there is potential still for this on the market.And we know, of course, Exact Sciences is another one in the race. Their share shot up as a result of the underwhelming results here. But they also-- they're looking at a much higher sensitivity rating in the 90s. So by comparison, they're sort of betting on which one has the best sensitivity. And the important part about that is, basically, how many times it could possibly give a false positive. That's sort of how you look at it and how many times it gives the right-- we learned a lot about this with COVID tests, as you imagine, as you remember with the at-home tests. So that's where the focus is right now.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, a name we will continue to track here. Anjalee, thanks so much.]"

FOX News drove 10.6 million and 21.4 million interactions on Meta Platform’s META Facebook and Instagram, respectively.However, on a year-over-year basis, we see that engagement on Fox News Digital has declined. Total multiplatform minutes and unique visitors fell 12% and 3%, respectively, while views remained constant. Interactions on Facebook and Instagram too declined 44% and 20%, respectively.This could be because of consumers’ ongoing shift of preference toward news streaming platforms, which are more convenient for them.Nonetheless, Fox News Digital outperformed its competitors like Warner Bros. Discovery’s WBD CNN, which had total multiplatform minutes and views of 2.4 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively. Warner Bros. Discovery had to shut down its news streaming unit CNN+, which accounted for huge losses, adding to its heavy debt.Fox News Media to Aid FOXA’s GrowthFox News Media gains significant traction from Fox News Channel (“FNC”), which has been America's most-watched network on election night. The coverage was co-anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and reached a remarkable 7.7 million viewers compared with Comcast’s CMCSA MSNBC, which averaged 3 million viewers.The American talk show, The Five, continued to dominate as the most-watched cable news show for eight straight months, averaging a whopping 3.7 million viewers.Tucker Carlson Tonight also maintained its status as the most-watched primetime show on cable news with 3.5 million total viewers.FOX &amp; Friends continued its dominance in early-morning cable news programs with an average of 1.5 million total viewers against MSNBC's Morning Joe, which had an average of 941,000 views.Story continuesFox Corporation Price and Consensus Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox Nation, which is a subsidiary of FNC, has also been bolstering the company’s content pipeline. The release of its original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back and Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner gained traction as its subscriptions and total hours watched grew 45% and 70% year over year, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2023.Beside FNC, Fox News Media gains from Fox Business Network, which drove 190 million multiplatform views, 327 million multiplatform minutes (grew 50% year over year) and 25.2 million multiplatform unique visitors (grew 5% year over year) in November.How Will Fox Survive Cord-Cutting?As mentioned earlier, Fox, which currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been facing threats from the ongoing cord-cutting due to the advent of streaming platforms.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Fox have declined 16.8% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector's fall of 33.6%.The company has acknowledged the threat and is taking steps to counter it by making its channels available on streaming platforms like Sling TV, Hulu TV and Fubo TV.Recently, Fox renewed its multi-year distribution agreement with Direct TV that includes the renewal of FS1, FS2, Big Ten Network, Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus, as well as retransmission consent for local Fox Television Stations across DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse.These efforts will help Fox reach a wide audience and grow its viewership, ultimately adding to its top line.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NET) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We continued to build our position in Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during the quarter as the shares declined with the overall software space and the long-term risk/ reward balance became more compelling. The company reported a strong second quarter, with revenue growth accelerating to 54%, as well as better gross and operating margins. Third quarter guidance was also ahead of Wall Street expectations. Given Cloudflare’s proprietary network and massive global scale, its software products have a disruptive price-performance advantage over competitors. As the company introduces new products as well as disruptive packaging/pricing, its unit level economics should continue to improve over time, with the company already well ahead of its long-term gross margin target of 74%, reporting 78.9% for the second quarter. This drives strong cross/upselling activity with customers, reflected in strong net-dollar expansion rates in excess of 125%. Indeed, in the most recent quarters, customers purchasing five or more products reached 81% of the base, six or more products reached 70% of the base, and seven or more products reached 58% of the base. Enterprise penetration continues to be a key long-term driver, with 1,749 customers now spending over $100,000 annually with the company, growing 61% and now accounting for over 60% of total revenue. With approximately 152,000 paying customers at the end of last quarter, large enterprise customers still represent just 1% of total paid customers and thus a material growth opportunity in the coming years. We continue to have high confidence in the company’s ability to innovate at a rapid pace (announced 20 new products or enhancements in September alone), package and bundle with disruptive pricing, and take material share in its large and growing addressable markets.”Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is well-positioned to benefit from the secular tailwinds in the enterprise software and edge computing space. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential12 Dividend stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 50010 Best Performing Technology ETFs in 2022Disclosure: None. 10 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more best technology stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined.As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 7.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite or simply Nasdaq, has retreated 29.44% in 2022.Of the three major indexes, the Nasdaq has decreased the most because it includes many growth stocks whose valuations have been negatively affected by the rising interest rates. Furthermore, the Nasdaq gives more weight to some big tech companies whose valuations have declined substantially this year as capital has moved from the tech sector into Treasuries given the higher yields.Federal Reserve's Interest Rate PolicyWhile October and November core inflation were lower than expected, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates next year.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, ""The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.""As for whether the increasing rates will cause a recession, Powell added, ""I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not. And if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not — it’s just not knowable.""If there is a moderate to severe recession next year, tech companies listed on the Nasdaq could face more headwinds.Tech StocksWhile many tech stocks have declined given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, some tech stocks have managed to do better than the Nasdaq for various reasons. Some tech stocks have done well this year because they have increased their earnings significantly more than expected. Other tech stocks have done well because their stocks have simply declined less than the Nasdaq given the strength of their businesses.Story continuesNevertheless, given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.booths, trade show, smau 2011, show tech, tech, people fair, milano editorial, people trade show, fair, hi tech show, exhibition, persons trade show, stands, smau, visitinAdriano Castelli / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 tech stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the Nasdaq's 29.44% decline as of December 14.

(NASDAQ:ASML) in a Q2 2022 investor letter,ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology. Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward. Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.Like ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are technology stocks that have outperformed the NASDAQ this year.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Suggested articles:15 Countries with Lowest Interest Rates25 Most Developed Countries in the WorldTop 15 Most Advanced Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Best Technology Stocks That Outperformed in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If there is a recession next year, some of the stocks with the low forward P/E ratios might not look as cheap because many companies might not earn as much as analyst estimates. If companies miss earnings substantially and lower their outlooks, analyst earnings for the future could come down and their forward P/E ratios could go higher.Given forward P/E ratios are not very dependable if companies miss their estimates, some investors use analyst price targets in addition to identifying stocks with competitive advantages to decide whether a stock is cheap or not.2022While the market has declined this year, some cheap stocks have outperformed the broader market for various reasons. Some cheap stocks have experienced strong growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. Other cheap stocks have declined less given the strength and stability of their businesses.As for the future, it remains to be seen whether there will be an economic slowdown in 2023. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022, we picked stocks with substantial competitive advantages that either trade below the average analyst price target or trade for below their intrinsic values.We then filtered the stocks to ensure that they outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date as of December 14.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 202212.

Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 9.27%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) has rallied 9.27% this year while the broader market has declined given the railroad company's strong earnings results. For Q3, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 and total sales rose 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Analysts have an average price target of $81.86 per share.Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an August investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -1.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Although its stock hasn't done well in the last five years, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) nevertheless outperformed the market in 2022 given its decline of 1.51% versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% year to date. One reason could be AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)'s valuation with its forward P/E ratio of 7.18 as of December 15, which is pretty attractive if the telecom can earn what analysts expect.In terms of expectations, analysts estimate AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) will earn $2.60 per share in 2022, $2.54 per share in 2023, and $2.60 per share in 2024.7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -6.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67The average analyst thinks there's upside in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) despite the stock of the enterprise software company declining 6.92% year to date. In terms of average estimates, analysts have a price target of $87.25 per share and they estimate Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will earn $4.88 per share in 2023, $5.55 per share in 2024, and $6.33 per share in 2025.67 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #7 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.6.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Oil Refinery Stocks To Buy. Oil refining refers to the treatment of crude oil after extraction to obtain high-quality oil components that are free of any impurities. Global refined oil product markets are likely to remain constrained until mid-decade, and the global downstream sector is facing meaningful near, intermediate, and long-term challenges, as per a new report published by S&amp;P Global and the International Energy Forum. According to an Oil Refining Industry Insights report, in 2020, the global oil refining capacity declined for the first time in 20 years and this trend continued in 2021, given the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, high refinery closures, and transformations to biofuels or distribution terminals. The global oil refining market was worth $1,345 billion in 2020, and it is expected to be valued at $3,751.5 billion by 2030, indicating a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2030. The global demand for oil refining is driven by the increase in world population and consequent urbanization, expansion and upgradation of refineries to meet higher demand for oil and oil derivative products, increased aviation and transportation, and the development of emerging economies. Some of the major African countries, such as Nigeria and Algeria, are attempting to become some of the largest regional hubs for refineries in the near future. Asia-Pacific is forecasted to remain a primary player in the oil refining market, and the region accounted for about 26.3% of the total global refining output as of 2021. It is expected to remain a major region given the planned refinery projects in China and India. Some of the best oil refinery stocks to buy include Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Our Methodology We selected the following oil refinery stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.

(Photo by Nic Antaya for The Washington Post via Getty Images)GM President Mark Reuss recently revealed that the company’s dealers serviced more than 11,000 Tesla vehicles, calling it a “growing business.”GM's Dealer Community Charging Program, first announced last year, calls on dealers to identify locations to install chargers, with a focus on community hubs like schools, libraries, and entertainment centers. Participating dealers are eligible to receive up to 10 19.2 kilowatt level 2 charging stations, allowing drivers to get a roughly 80% battery charge in under three hours, according to Hassani.The program is part of a $750 million investment GM is making to rapidly expand its charging infrastructure as the company aims to go all-electric by 2035.""Since we announced the program last year, we had a number of businesses reach out to us and say 'I want to be a host for one of these locations,'"" Hassani said. ""And we think bringing everybody in, which is not just the driver of the vehicle but letting the communities participate, that is something that's very core to General Motors' identity and fabric in this community in this economy.""Story continues'GM’s ambition is to have everybody in an EV'While higher gas prices helped EVs surpass 5% of new car sales in the U.S. this year, adoption still lags way behind European countries and China, the largest and fastest growing EV market globally.In a recent study by Consumer Reports, more than 60% of respondents in the U.S. cited charging logistics as the key barrier to buying or leasing an EV. The current lack of charging infrastructure and concerns about the power grid’s ability to handle the EV load has also contributed to the slower adoption of electric vehicles.Hassani said the speed and reliability of existing charging stations have been another concern. While GM’s program calls for 3,250 fast chargers to be deployed across the U.S. by the end of 2025, a majority of the existing chargers are level 2. Despite the slower rates, Hassani said they remain the most affordable option for drivers, with many offering free jolts through local businesses.“One thing that is fundamentally different [from gas-powered vehicles] is the fact that charging is, in most cases, a daily ritual for folks at home,"" Hassani said. ""Whether they're plugging it in overnight, like they do their phone, whether they're going on a road trip — that is an experience they're going to be having much more frequently and in a very good way.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The Biden administration has made increasing EV charging infrastructure a key priority, calling for a $7.5 billion investment to build a network of half a million EV chargers nationwide. Just over 57,000 stations currently exist, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy.Building out critical infrastructure comes with an added incentive for GM, as it rapidly expands its portfolio of EVs. Hassani said the aim isn’t just to attract new EV drivers but build brand loyalty among existing customers who may not be on board with GM’s vehicles yet.""GM’s ambition is to have everybody in an EV — not just seeing EVs in cities where we’re currently seeing a lot of adoption,"" Hassani said. ""That means in the heartland of the country and the middle of the country. For us, getting 40,000 chargers deployed across the U.S. and Canada in those communities that don’t have a single charger there today is hugely consequential.”—Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian here with more on this story. What's going on?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's kind of another black eye for the self-driving industry here. You know, Cruise, GM's big autonomous division out in San Francisco, apparently a couple of crashes here with cars that were inappropriately hard braking or becoming immobilized while operating. So basically the car, like right here in motion, it comes across a hazard, and it stops and panics. And what happens is it becomes an object in traffic that's stuck there. And people have to get out in the middle of traffic, so it's problematic.So apparently, there's three accidents, three hard braking accidents with this, and a number of other incidents that we don't know about. GM says-- their crew says they're complying with the investigation and that they've done 700,000 autonomous miles with the system. So it's still happening. They want to try to expand their-- probably right now, they're in 30% of SF. They want to expand to 100%. So not exactly easy when you've got kind of some issues in a probe going into it.But I will say this, though. This comes after Ford pulled the plug on Argo AI, their autonomous division. And then also we have Tesla still under investigation with NHTSA because of these crashes at accident scenes. So it's still-- this technology is still very nascent.DAVE BRIGGS: Years and years away, isn't it?JARED BLIKRE: I guess I can sleep well at night knowing that the default action, if we have an AI algorithm controlling a car, rolling down the streets of San Francisco or whatever it is, it goes into panic mode, and it just sits there.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It stops, yeah.JARED BLIKRE: It just stops.]"

187,304be37c-8121-3f2a-ab89-25a62093455b,GM,2022-12-17,12 Countries That Produce the Best Cars in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-produce-best-cars-155927426.html,1671206367,STORY,"['F', 'TSLA', 'GM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 countries that produce the best cars in the world. For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Cars in the World. The car industry is one of the largest industries in the world. The industry is also often used as a gauge for the wider economy due to its impact on job creation and output. Car manufacturing has traditionally been a labor intensive sector, which generates employment. Generally, an economic slowdown leads to lower car sales, which in turn reduces profits for the car companies and leads to unemployment as they cut costs and reduce their production.In terms of production statistics, the global automotive market produced 110 million units in 2021, and these will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% from then until 2030 to sit at 305 million units by the end of the forecast period according to data from the research firm Markets Research Future. The firm outlines that the industry grew in 2022 as pent up demand from the coronavirus pandemic was unleashed. The largest growth driver for this industry was the improvement in the automotive motor, and its ability to generate more power due to improvements. Additionally, Markets Research Future also believes that Europe was the largest constituent of the global automotive industry, as it accounted for 23% of the market last year. While the research firm assigns a 4.5% growth rate to the industry for 2030 as a whole, its growth estimate for Europe is stunning, with an estimated CAGR of 39.5%.Another report, this time from McKinsey, breaks down the industry into different segments. McKinsey believes that going forward, the shared vehicle industry will grow the most, as consumers will shift to application specific uses for cars. This, in turn, will prompt manufacturers to make different kinds, such as those that are designed specifically for ridesharing applications and use. McKinsey is also quite optimistic about the future of autonomous vehicles, as it believes that up to 15% of vehicles sold in 2030 can be autonomous if the necessary regulatory requirements are met. On the topic of electric vehicles, it believes that adoption will depend on localization since the cost of ownership and government support will continue to play major roles in stimulating demand. Some leading car companies in the world are Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).Story continuesPhoto by carlos aranda on UnsplashOur Methodology In order to sift out which countries in the world make the best cars, we decided to take a look at the countries whose products are in greatest demand globally. This was carried out by determining country-wise exports by the end of 2021, under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule Item 8703 'Motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons, including station wagons and racing cars (excluding motor vehicles of heading 8702)'. The data for these exports has been gathered via Trademap.org.12 Countries That Produce the Best Cars in the World12. Czech Republic Car Exports as of 2021: $23 billion The Czech Republic is a landlocked European country with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $503 billion as of 2022 and a high GDP per capita of $47,527. The country has six local car manufacturers, with two that are among the oldest car companies in the world. Two of its oldest car companies are Skoda Auto a.s. and Praga. The former was set up in 1925 while the latter was in 1907. Out of these two, Praga now exclusively focuses its efforts on manufacturing sports cars and offers two models as of 2022. These are the Praga Bohema and the Praga R1. The Bohema has a top speed exceeding 300 kilometers per hour and can accelerate to 100 kilometers per hour in less than 2.3 seconds. While Praga is a sports car company, Skoda manufactures all kinds of vehicles such as sports utility vehicles and family cars.11. People's Republic of China Car Exports as of 2021: $24 billion The People's Republic of China is the second largest economy in the world and the world's largest country in terms of population. This lends it a strong car industry since a growing population has to cater to its mobility needs. The Chinese car industry has been one the largest in the world in terms of total vehicles produced for more than a decade now. However, the country exports fewer cars than other economic powerhouses. Its car exports were worth $24 billion in 2021, and stood at 2.4 million tons with an average value of $10,143 per unit. Yet, the People's Republic of China is only one of two countries on our list that has grown its car exports between 2017 and 2021. It has around 50 car manufacturing companies, which are divided between private and state owned enterprises. International companies such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) also build cars in China, to take the cost advantage and target the local population. Alongside Tesla, China is now witnessing a growth in local car companies as well, with firms such as Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) making their mark on the local industry.10. Slovak Republic Car Exports as of 2021: $26 billion The Slovak Republic is a Central European country that gained its independence in 1993. The country's car industry's strength is no surprise as it was formerly part of Czechoslovakia, and therefore, inherited the automobile industry in part as companies such as Skoda were also based in the Slovak Republic. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia however, the car manufacturers shifted to the Czech Republic. Currently, domestic firms focus on manufacturing trucks for the military and other vehicles for urban transport. However, multinational giants such as Volkswagen, Kia, and Peugeot all have a manufacturing presence in the country, allowing the Slovak Republic to become of the largest car exporters in the world. As of 2021 end, it exported $26.8 billion worth of vehicles in the form of 1.6 million tons and a unit value of $16,345.9. Canada Car Exports as of 2021: $29 billion Canada is a North American country and one of the largest in the world in terms of land mass. The country's economy stood at $2.2 trillion in purchasing power parity terms in 2022, making it the 15th largest in the world, lending it a GDP per capita of $57,827. Like Slovakia, Canada is also home primarily to foreign car manufacturers, with local firms focusing instead on manufacturing buses. However, Canada does make its own armored cars. The Canadian firm Terradyne Armoured Vehicles builds light and stock armored cars that are capable of stopping armor piercing bullets. Canada also has a diverse automotive manufacturing ecosystem of suppliers, and one of its largest companies is Magna International, an automotive parts supplier. Canada's car export stood at $29 billion in 2021. In Canada, American companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) enjoy a huge popularity of their products.8. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Car Exports as of 2021: $30 billion United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European country with an economy worth $3.8 trillion in 2022 and a GDP per capita of $55,862. The country is one of the first to have manufactured the modern day automobile, in the form of Rolls Royce 10 hp which was manufactured in 1904. Legend has it that the vehicle was so stable that a penny standing upright would maintain its position even when the engine was running. Since then, the U.K. has come a long way, and it is home to some of the most iconic car companies in the world such as McLaren, Lotus, Jaguar, Aston Martin, Bentley, and Land Rover. These are among some of the most valuable cars in the world, and McLaren's McLaren F1 is still the world's fastest naturally aspirated production car despite being introduced more than two decades back. These cars do not rely on turbochargers or other equipment to force air into the engine.American cars made by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are also extremely popular in the country.7. Kingdom of Belgium Car Exports as of 2021: $31 billion The Kingdom of Belgium is a European country that gained independence in 1830 from the Dutch Empire. It has a high GDP per capita of $62,065 and a high population density as well. Belgium has been home to some of the oldest car manufacturing companies in the world, such as Miesse, which established operations in 1894, and Ateliers Vivinus S.A., which started production a year later in 1895. Right now, Belgium is home to several different car companies, such as Edran which solely manufactures the Enigma sports car with 802 bhp, and Gillet, which is a car company started by a former racecar driver.6. Kingdom of Spain Car Exports as of 2021: $33 billion The Kingdom of Spain is a European country with one of the oldest civilizations in the world. The country had a $2.2 trillion GDP in 2022. The country is currently home to six different car companies. Its largest car exporter is SEAT S.A., which is a Volkswagen subsidiary and sells vehicles under the SEAT and Cupra brands to countries such as the United Kingdom. The Kingdom of Spain's car exports stood at $33.9 billion in 2021, and it had exported a total of 2.5 million tons of vehicles with an average value of $13,308 per unit. A large chunk of population in Spain also imports cars from US automakers like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Click to continue reading and see 5 Countries That Produce the Best Cars in the World.  Suggested Articles:10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 2022Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World23 Countries with Highest Quality of Life in 2022Disclosure: None. 12 Countries That Produce the Best Cars in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

BGS is focused on enhancing its business structure by concentrating on core areas with greater potential. Moving on these lines, the company inked a deal to sell its Back to Nature brand to Barilla America.Apart from improving the structure, the deal is likely to help B&amp;G Foods lower its long-term debt. The divestiture is expected to be concluded in the first quarter of 2023.B&amp;G Foods, Inc. Price and ConsensusB&amp;G Foods, Inc. Price and ConsensusB&amp;G Foods, Inc. price-consensus-chart | B&amp;G Foods, Inc. QuoteWhat Else to Know?B&amp;G Foods has been battling cost inflation like many other industry players. In the third quarter of 2022, the adjusted gross profit of $108 million declined 11.9% year over year from $122.6 million in the year-ago period.Moreover, the adjusted gross margin contracted 340 basis points (bps) to 20.4%. The gross margin was hurt by greater-than-anticipated input cost inflation. This includes escalated raw materials and transportation expenses. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company expects input cost inflation to bear a significant impact industry-wide for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.However, BGS is on track to mitigate the impacts of inflation on the gross margin by undertaking cost-saving initiatives, increasing list prices and locking in prices via short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements. Nonetheless, these actions may not fully offset supplementary cost headwinds through the rest of fiscal 2022 and beyond.In the third quarter of 2022, SG&amp;A expenses escalated by 2.4% to $47.5 million on higher general and administrative expenses, selling expenses and consumer marketing expenses, partially negated by a decline in acquisition/divestiture-related and non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA dipped 16.6% to $80.2 million due to industry-wide input cost inflation and supply-chain woes, somewhat offset by elevated pricing. The adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 370 bps to 15.2% in the third quarter of 2022.B&amp;G Foods lowered its adjusted EBITDA view for fiscal 2022 to the $290-$300 million band compared to the $300-$320 million band mentioned earlier. It reported $358 million in fiscal 2021. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in fiscal 2022 are envisioned to be 90 cents to $1.00 versus the $1.08-$1.28 band stated before. In fiscal 2021, the company reported an EPS of $1.88.Nonetheless, management expects to maintain the momentum in demand for its products. For fiscal 2022, management anticipates net sales in the range of $2.1-$2.14 billion. In fiscal 2021, net sales amounted to $2,056.3 million ($2.06 billion).Shares of the company have declined 33.2% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 9.4%.Story continuesLooking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

Shares have lost about 8.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Target due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Target Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates and Decline Y/YTarget Corporation came up with third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Comparable sales increased for the 22nd successive quarter, primarily gaining from growth in store channels.However, higher markdown rates and increased freight costs continued to weigh on margins. The bottom line missed the consensus mark and fell sharply from the year-ago period. This was the third straight earnings miss.Management informed that sales and profit trends softened in the latter part of the quarter. Soaring inflation, rising interest rates and ongoing geopolitical tensions have brought a drastic change in consumer behavior. As a result, the profit performance came below the company’s expectations.This Minneapolis, MN-based company cautioned that softening sales and profit trends have continued in November. It now foresees a low-single-digit decline in comparable sales and an operating margin rate of around 3% in the key holiday quarter. Earlier, Target had forecast low-to-mid-single-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2022 and an operating margin to be around 6% for the back half of the year.Nonetheless, to simplify and improve efficiencies across the business, Target announced an enterprise-wide cost-containment effort. Through the initiative, the company plans to save between $2 billion and $3 billion over the next three years. Despite a challenging operating environment, management aims to attain total sales of more than $100 billion this year.Story continuesSales &amp; Earnings PictureTarget reported adjusted earnings of $1.54 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 and our estimate of $2.07. Also, the bottom line declined significantly from the $3.03 reported in the year-ago period.The big-box retailer generated total revenues of $26,518 million, which increased 3.4% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,355 million and our estimate of $26,300.6 million. We note that sales jumped 3.3% to $26,122 million, while other revenues rose 9.5% to $396 million driven by the growth in Roundel ad business. Target witnessed unit share gains across all five core merchandising categories.Meanwhile, comparable sales for the quarter under discussion increased 2.7%, surpassing our estimate of 2.3%. The comparable sales growth reflected a 1.4% increase in traffic and a 1.3% increase in the average transaction amount. Comparable store sales grew 3.2%, while comparable digital sales increased 0.3%. Same-day services led digital growth, most notably through drive-up service, which delivered high single-digit growth. Frequency categories, such as beauty, food and beverage and household essentials, drove comparable sales growth.Target’s debit card penetration contracted 90 basis points to 10.8%, while credit card penetration decreased 10 basis points to 8.8%. The total REDcard penetration declined to 19.6% from the year-ago quarter’s 20.7%.MarginsThe gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 24.7%, reflecting higher markdown rates, inventory shrink, and merchandise and freight costs. Additionally, the increased compensation and headcount in distribution centers and the cost of managing the excess inventory also hurt the gross margin rate. Meanwhile, the operating income declined 49.2% to $1,022 million, while the operating margin shriveled to 3.9% from 7.8% in the year-ago period.Other Financial DetailsTarget ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $954 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $14,237 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,019 million. During the quarter, Target paid out dividends of $497 million.Management has incurred capital expenditures of $4.3 billion during the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, and plans to spend around $5.5 billion in the fiscal. The company didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter.On the store front, Target plans to conclude roughly 200 full remodel projects in the current fiscal. It also intends to complete about 200 fulfillment retrofits this year to support same-day services. The company is on track to add 23 new locations to the chain in the current fiscal year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -57.5% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Target has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Target has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -8.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 6.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -55.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -57.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 points to a change of -59.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -31.4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +74.9% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -19.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $108.43 billion and $111.66 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog DevicesNotably, that recent sale by Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology Vivek Jain was not the only time they sold Analog Devices shares this year. Earlier in the year, they fetched US$166 per share in a -US$2.3m sale. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$167). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 43%of Vivek Jain's holding.Insiders in Analog Devices didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Analog Devices Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Analog Devices. In total, insiders dumped US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Analog Devices Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Analog Devices insiders own about US$289m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Analog Devices Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Analog Devices shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Analog Devices makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Analog Devices.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries That Produce the Most Coal. The global coal market is worth billions of dollars according to a research report from The Business Research Company. The research firm estimates that the market was worth $595 billion last year, and it will sit at $618 billion by the end of this year after growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9%. It shares that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has stimulated coal prices, as the global commodities market has been upended because of the war. The Business Research Company adds that from 2022 to 2026, the industry will grow at 3.7% to be worth $715 billion by the end of the forecast period.Since one of the biggest uses of coal is in power generation, it's also worthwhile to take a look at this particular market subsegment. Fortunately, a report from Mordor Intelligence analyzes the global coal fired power generation market. It states that the industry generated 10,100 terawatt hours of electricity in 2018, growing from 9,806 terawatt hours in 2017. The firm adds that between 2020 and 2025, the segment will be a small grower, with a CAGR that is lower than 2%. Developing countries continue to rely on coal power plants for their electricity, with India and China accounting for 85% of new coal power generation capacity since 2005.Today's piece will take a look at the world's largest coal producing countries.

203,7cd74b4b-1d57-3514-abc8-a456e04b77cd,MAR,2022-12-17,4 Gold Stocks to Watch in a Promising Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-gold-stocks-watch-promising-143502080.html,1671201302,STORY,"['SI=F', 'GC=F', 'FNV', 'AU', '^GSPC', 'AEM']","[The prospects for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry look bright at the moment on the back of improving gold prices. The yellow metal is likely to gain next year on improving demand, fears of a recession and geopolitical tensions.With gold prices anticipated to gain further on demand-supply imbalance, companies like Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV, Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, AngloGold Ashanti AU and Galiano Gold Inc. GAU are well-poised for growth, backed by their strong balance sheets, efforts to lower costs and growth initiatives.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Gold industry mainly comprises companies engaged in extracting gold from mines. The mines may be either underground or open pits. Mining is a long and complex process, and requires significant financial resources. It involves exploration to evaluate the deposit's size, followed by assessing ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, and, finally, develop the mine before the actual mining process. It normally takes 10-20 years for a gold mine to produce material that can finally be refined. The players in the industry nowadays use a range of sophisticated techniques to extract gold and convert it into dore bars, an alloy of gold and silver, alongside other impurities. These are then sent for purification, following which gold is purchased in the forms of bars or coins or used in jewelry or for other purposes.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Gold IndustryGold Prices Regain Ground: The yellow metal started this year on a strong note, hitting a high of $2,078.70 an ounce in the first week of March. However, it soon lost steam as the Fed announced its first rate hike since 2018 to tame the mounting inflation. Since then, for a major part of 2022, gold prices remained under pressure (even dropped to as low as $1,618 an ounce) due to monetary tightening by central banks around the world. Gold prices have, however, regained ground lately. It crossed the $1,700 an ounce mark in November as the Fed meeting that month signaled a likelihood of a slowdown of rate hikes. Gold rose 7% in November, breaking the seven-month decline stint. So far in December, gold has gained 2% and peaked at $1,836.90 an ounce on Dec 13, following the release of the lower-than-expected U.S. annual inflation figures. Gold has since steadied, closing at $1,787.80 an ounce on Dec 15, as the Fed offered a more hawkish outlook on its policy than markets anticipated. At its last meeting, the Fed delivered a smaller half percentage point rate hike but projected a terminal rate of 5.1% next year, higher than previously stated. While rate hikes pose challenges to gold, continued geopolitical risks and fears of recession will likely drive the demand for gold as a hedge.Story continuesLabor Issues, High Costs Persist: The industry continues to face a shortage of skilled workforce, causing a spike in wages. The industry players are persistently grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control gold prices, it focuses on improving sales volume and operating cash flow, and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources, such as solar or wind farms, to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.India and China to Support Demand: India and China together account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. A pick-up in demand in China is expected next year, aided by fewer COVID disruptions, a cautious economic rebound and a gradual pick-up in consumer confidence. Retail demand in India is expected to improve on improved consumer confidence and pent-up demand. The demand for physical gold is seasonally higher in the later part of the year, aided by the festival and wedding season in India.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance to Support Prices: Depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines remain inherent threats to the industry. Due to the scarcity of discoveries and exhaustive existing resources, miners prefer building up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging new ones that are inherently risky and capital-intensive. On the demand side, the use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology is rising. The yellow metal has long been considered a safe-haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty. So, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices. This bodes well for the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Mining - Gold Industry, which is a 39-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it at the top 39% of 248 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Mining-Gold Industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index, as well as the Basic Material sector, in a year. The stocks in the industry have collectively gained 5.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector’s decline of 2.0% and 15.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA, a commonly used multiple for valuing gold-mining companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 6.86X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 10.57X and the Basic Material sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 6.17X. This is shown in the charts below.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M RatioEnterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M RatioOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.24X and as low as 4.63X, with the median being 6.30X.4 Mining-Gold Stocks to Keep an Eye onAngloGold Ashanti: The company recently completed the acquisition of Coeur Mining’s (CDE) C-Horst, SNA, Secret Pass and Daisy ore bodies, as well as the decommissioned Sterling Mine in the Beatty district of southern Nevada. The addition of the properties consolidates AU’s ownership position in one of North America’s most promising new gold districts. Gold production for the third quarter of 2022 was up 20% year over year to 738,000 ounces, courtesy of solid performances across the portfolio, bringing the year-to-date total to 1.8 Moz (million ounces). This puts the company on track to meet its production guidance of 2.55-2.80Moz in 2022. The majority of production growth is expected to come from Obuasi, with improvements expected at other assets. The company continues to mitigate the impacts of inflation on its costs through the continued integration of its new operating model (which is aimed at improving operating efficiencies), the operational excellence program already in place, and the Full Asset Potential (FP) program. The FP program aims to achieve a step-change in AngloGold Ashanti’s competitiveness by 2024 and includes a three-month assessment that covers all aspects of the company’s mine sites. The company's shares have gained 43% in the past three months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s, headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2022 earnings has moved up 13% over the past 60 days. AU has a long-term earnings estimate growth rate of 4%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: AUGaliano Gold: The company reported gold production of 43,899 ounces in the third quarter of 2022. Higher production for the quarter was driven by improved metallurgical recoveries and stockpile material performing better than expected. The significant work undertaken in the second quarter of 2022 to optimize the Asanko Gold Mine’s plant performance assisted in the higher recoveries achieved during the period. Backed by the performance, GAU revised its gold production guidance upward to 160,000-170,000 ounces for 2022. Backed by these developments, the company's shares have gained 10.4% in the past three months. GAU concluded the metallurgical test work program at Esaase, which provides greater clarity on the deposit’s metallurgical recoveries. These results, in conjunction with the strong exploration success achieved during the quarter, pave the way to reinstate Mineral Reserves for the Asanko Gold Mine, which will be provided in the upcoming Feasibility Study Technical Report.Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Galiano Gold has an expected earnings growth of 133% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2022 earnings has moved up 133% over the past 60 days.

""What the state is not going to allow is for the mine to become a colonial enclave, with First Quantum thinking that they are the owners of that piece of land.""First Quantum reported revenue from Cobre Panama of $2.29 billion in the first nine months of this year. It shares the joint venture with the Korea Panama Mining Corporation (KPMC), which holds a 20% stake.Mainly focused on copper, First Quantum also mines nickel, zinc and cobalt in projects across South America, Africa, Europe and Australia.Earlier on Friday, First Quantum said in a statement it was disappointed by the ""unnecessary actions"" taken by the government and that the two parties ""came very close to an agreement.""Asvat said operations were still ongoing as the suspension order had yet to take effect.Shares of First Quantum have lost more than 15% of their value since closing on Wednesday. Analysts at Jefferies cut their target price due to ""the risk of a more catastrophic outcome.""Story continuesJefferies said the most likely outcome, however, would be for negotiations to be extended and the two sides to agree on new terms.The Panamanian government hired financial advisers to explore alternatives with other firms in recent months, according to a source familiar with the matter.(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire in Mexico CityWriting by Sarah MorlandEditing by Barbara Lewis and Matthew Lewis)]"

Shares have added about 8.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.NVIDIA Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues SurpassNVIDIA reported mixed results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line surpassed the same. However, third-quarter earnings and revenues both declined significantly on a year-over-year basis.For the third quarter, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings of 58 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.1%. Moreover, the reported figure plunged 50% year over year while increasing 14% sequentially. The year-over-year decline in earnings was mainly due to lower revenues and increased operating expenses.Third-quarter revenues plunged 17% year over year and 12% sequentially to $5.93 billion, primarily due to continued weakness across its Gaming and Professional Visualization market segments. Lower data center demand in China also hurt the top line in the reported quarter. However, the top line beat the consensus mark of $5.81 billion.Segment DetailsNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments — Graphics and Compute &amp; Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Graphics accounted for 35.7% of fiscal third-quarter revenues. The segment’s top line plunged 48% year over year and 24% sequentially to $2.12 billion.Story continuesCompute &amp; Networking represented 64.3% of fiscal third-quarter revenues. The segment comprises Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles, and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.Compute &amp; Networking revenues soared 27% year over year to $3.82 billion. However, the segment’s revenues declined 2% sequentially.Market Platform’s Top Line DetailsBased on the market platform, Gaming revenues plunged 51% year over year and 23% sequentially to $1.57 billion and accounted for 26.5% of total revenues. The decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products. This reflected a reduction in channel partner inventory levels amid weak demand due to macroeconomic headwinds and lockdowns in China, which continue to weigh on consumer demand.Revenues from Data Center (64.6% of revenues) jumped 31% year over year and 1% from the previous quarter to $3.83 billion. This year-over-year rise was driven by the strong demand for its chips across U.S. cloud service providers, consumer internet companies and other vertical industries.However, softness in China and the U.S. government’s new restrictions on the export of A100 and H100-based products to China negatively impacted the top line.Professional Visualization revenues (3.4% of revenues) decreased 65% year over year and 60% sequentially to $200 million. The decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations.Automotive sales (4.2% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $251 million, up 86% on a year-over-year basis and 14% sequentially. The increase was mainly driven by the increased revenue contribution from self-driving solutions.OEM and Other revenues (1.3% of revenues) plunged 69% year over year and 48% sequentially to $73 million. The decline was mainly due to the weak performance of Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, which generated nominal sales in the quarter compared with $105 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, lower Jetson and notebook OEM sales also negatively impacted the overall unit’s performance in the third quarter.Operating DetailsNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin contracted by 10.9% year over year to 56.1%, mainly due to a $702 million charge for inventory, largely related to the lower Data Center demand in China. This was partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 30% year over year and 3% sequentially to $1.79 billion on higher compensation-related expenses associated with employee growth and increased data center infrastructure-related expenses.The non-GAAP operating income slumped 55% year over year to $1.54 billion.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Oct 30, 2022, NVDA’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.14 billion, down from $17.04 billion as of Jul 31, 2022.As of Oct 30, 2022, the total long-term debt (including current maturities) was $10.95 billion, flat with the previous quarter ended Jul 31, 2022.NVIDIA generated $392 million in operating cash flows, down from the year-ago quarter’s $1.52 billion and the previous quarter’s $1.27 billion. The free cash flow was an outflow of $156 million compared to the inflow of the year-ago quarter’s $1.28 billion and the previous quarter’s $824 million.In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the company generated operating and free cash flows of $3.39 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively.In the third quarter, the company returned $3.59 billion to shareholders through $100 million in dividend payouts and $3.49 billion in share repurchases. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, NVIDIA paid out $300 million in dividends and bought back common stocks worth $8.83 billion.Fourth-Quarter GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $6 billion (+/-2%), lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.23 billion. The company expects to resume sequential growth in the Gaming segment.

And taking a look back at some of the trending tickers along the way, today's focus, Nvidia. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joins us now. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hi there. Well, looking at our top 10 here, Nvidia is number nine. That is nine, number nine, as of last Friday. And I'll tell you what, Nvidia has been a mainstay of the Yahoo Finance trending tickers for years. But it only topped out at about number four this year. And it did that on two separate occasions. I'm going to pull up a chart here in a second. First of all, Nvidia down about 2 and 1/2% today, just the latest news. Powell under fire here, and chip stocks under fire as a result of the Fed kind of amping up that hawkish rhetoric. We're going to take a look at the sector in a second.But here's Nvidia over the last two years. This chart is going to look very familiar. Lots of pandemic era charts look like this. Here is the big rise in 2021, only to be met with a huge decline in 2022. Now, at the highs, Nvidia had a stock price of $384.33 with a market cap of $834.4 billion. And when we think mega-caps, don't usually think about Nvidia, but it actually surpassed Meta in market cap on February 7 of this year. So Nvidia was $618.2 billion that day. Meta, because it had one of its worst days in years-- it had a pretty bad year-- that was a day where it sunk to $612.2 billion.Finally, at the lows of the year here, and that was only about a month and a half ago when the rest of the stock market bottomed here. We have Nvidia hitting a new 2022 low in market cap as well of $279.6 billion. And just looking at some of the mega caps overall, let's hear it. Here, we have-- this is an intraday picture of them, along with their market cap. So here is Nvidia at 411.6 million. You can see where it fits into the grand scheme of things. Bigger than Walmart, but still smaller than Exxon here. And we know that those energy stocks have been some of the year's biggest gainers.Story continuesAnd in fact, when we take a look at the year to date performance here, let me just lap that. We can see, indeed, Nvidia among some of the worst performers of the year here, down 44%. And I just mentioned Exxon-- what a contrast-- that's up 69%, but pretty much in the same group as Amazon and not quite as bad as Meta, guys.BRAD SMITH: All right.JARED BLIKRE: Comparison.BRAD SMITH: Continuing to look back at some of the key performers of the year. Jared, appreciate the time.]"

FOX News drove 10.6 million and 21.4 million interactions on Meta Platform’s META Facebook and Instagram, respectively.However, on a year-over-year basis, we see that engagement on Fox News Digital has declined. Total multiplatform minutes and unique visitors fell 12% and 3%, respectively, while views remained constant. Interactions on Facebook and Instagram too declined 44% and 20%, respectively.This could be because of consumers’ ongoing shift of preference toward news streaming platforms, which are more convenient for them.Nonetheless, Fox News Digital outperformed its competitors like Warner Bros. Discovery’s WBD CNN, which had total multiplatform minutes and views of 2.4 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively. Warner Bros. Discovery had to shut down its news streaming unit CNN+, which accounted for huge losses, adding to its heavy debt.Fox News Media to Aid FOXA’s GrowthFox News Media gains significant traction from Fox News Channel (“FNC”), which has been America's most-watched network on election night. The coverage was co-anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and reached a remarkable 7.7 million viewers compared with Comcast’s CMCSA MSNBC, which averaged 3 million viewers.The American talk show, The Five, continued to dominate as the most-watched cable news show for eight straight months, averaging a whopping 3.7 million viewers.Tucker Carlson Tonight also maintained its status as the most-watched primetime show on cable news with 3.5 million total viewers.FOX &amp; Friends continued its dominance in early-morning cable news programs with an average of 1.5 million total viewers against MSNBC's Morning Joe, which had an average of 941,000 views.Story continuesFox Corporation Price and Consensus Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox Nation, which is a subsidiary of FNC, has also been bolstering the company’s content pipeline. The release of its original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back and Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner gained traction as its subscriptions and total hours watched grew 45% and 70% year over year, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2023.Beside FNC, Fox News Media gains from Fox Business Network, which drove 190 million multiplatform views, 327 million multiplatform minutes (grew 50% year over year) and 25.2 million multiplatform unique visitors (grew 5% year over year) in November.How Will Fox Survive Cord-Cutting?As mentioned earlier, Fox, which currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been facing threats from the ongoing cord-cutting due to the advent of streaming platforms.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Fox have declined 16.8% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector's fall of 33.6%.The company has acknowledged the threat and is taking steps to counter it by making its channels available on streaming platforms like Sling TV, Hulu TV and Fubo TV.Recently, Fox renewed its multi-year distribution agreement with Direct TV that includes the renewal of FS1, FS2, Big Ten Network, Fox Deportes and Fox Soccer Plus, as well as retransmission consent for local Fox Television Stations across DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse.These efforts will help Fox reach a wide audience and grow its viewership, ultimately adding to its top line.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

228,2bccf5b5-4ee8-371e-8d86-df02a29d5aa7,DIS,2022-12-17,Are Investors Undervaluing The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) By 37%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-walt-disney-company-110010145.html,1671274810,STORY,['DIS'],"[Does the December share price for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.37bUS$8.16bUS$10.4bUS$14.2bUS$16.1bUS$17.5bUS$18.7bUS$19.7bUS$20.5bUS$21.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 8.66%Est @ 6.66%Est @ 5.25%Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$5.0kUS$7.0kUS$8.2kUS$10.4kUS$11.0kUS$11.0kUS$10.9kUS$10.6kUS$10.2kUS$9.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$94bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.0%) = US$357bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$357b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$165bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$259b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$90.1, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.089. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for DIS.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.11% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.85%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.1%.Heading into today, shares of the entertainment company had lost 1.05% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 3.58% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.19% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Walt Disney as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Walt Disney to post earnings of $0.78 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 26.42%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $23.2 billion, up 6.33% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.07 per share and revenue of $90.76 billion, which would represent changes of +15.3% and +9.72%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Walt Disney should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

The Media Conglomerates industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.11 as of yesterday's close.The Media Conglomerates industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

And let me put this on a five-day basis. I'm going to start with Tesla because of all the mega caps here, it is by far down the most, down 16%. By the way, that is its worst one-week performance since March of 2020. And that would put it all the way back down here near the pandemic lows.It is up substantially more than that. However, you've got to take a look at this top right here and wonder if that is a huge distribution top because Elon Musk has been selling a lot of Tesla stock. That's one of the big headlines from this week.Now, you take a look at this 10-year chart. That is a different story, but let's dial it back down to a year to date chart, and you can see that it is camping out, back down by those lows of the year. Also, as if there's not enough other news, we're also going to take a look in the Dow at Disney.Now we've got ""Avatar, Way of the Water"" coming out this week, and I think $17 million in pre-sales. That's chump change, right? Because this movie is supposed to bring in about $150, $190 million over the weekend. And that's just getting started. I think the original ""Avatar"" of 2009 brought in something like 2-- over 2-- almost $3 billion. So-- or $3 trillion or $3 billion. I'm getting my orders of magnitude mixed up here.So let's move on to the travel sector, where we got a little bit of disappointing news from some of the air carriers this week. JetBlue dialing back down some of its expectations for the fourth quarter. Also saw that out of Spirit Airlines, some of their key metrics undergoing a little bit of revision here. So December not the best travel month, it's looking like so far. And some of these airlines have been stumbling. Here's JetBlue, another stock that is down about over 50% year to date, camping out by its lows as well.Story continuesJust want to get on to Spirit Airlines-- I mentioned that as well. And you can see that's a little bit of a different picture here, some really choppy action although it's in, I would say, the lower third of its price range for the year.

Graduation events held by the company today recognized newly hired pre-apprentices now on track to begin an overhead apprenticeship school in 2023. This on-the-job training is a requirement for performing the role of a lineworker, a key role helping to ensure reliable power is safely delivered to communities across northern Illinois.Today’s graduation represents one of the largest overhead classes in recent history, as ComEd has expanded investments in training and committed to hire hundreds of additional entry-level craft workers in the next couple of years to prepare for the state’s clean energy transition.""ComEd is working to ensure that as we grow and move toward a clean energy future, we are creating equitable opportunity for diverse, local talent to join our company and to play a role in addressing climate change,"" said Terence Donnelly, president and COO of ComEd. ""Congratulations to our newest class of overhead trainees for taking essential steps forward in your career journeys, and for your dedication to this challenging yet rewarding work to deliver safe, reliable and resilient power to all our northern Illinois communities in the years ahead.""Today’s graduates have completed required skills training across the company’s three regional facilities: the Chicago Training Center, the Joliet Training Center, and the Rockford Training Center. ComEd craft trainees receive competitive pay of $29 an hour on average at the time of their hire and are paid during their training. More information on the training progression for entry-level craft roles can be found here.The latest class of graduates is diverse with more than 32 percent minorities, 12 percent Veterans, and an increase in female hires to join the workforce as well. Additionally, graduates hail from all corners of the service region, representing 89 unique zip codes from across northern Illinois.Story continuesWorking with ComEd, we are committed to building a diverse talent pipeline to prepare residents for the growing numbers of clean energy jobs in Illinois,"" said Terry McGoldrick, President of IBEW Local 15. ""By expanding access to our apprenticeship training programs, we’re working to invite more men and women of all backgrounds to learn a skilled trade that will be critical to powering communities, and the economy, for years to come.""New entry-level craft positions – including the overhead helper position and other entry-level union roles – will play a key role in building and operating a more resilient grid that can withstand increasingly severe weather and meet the increased demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles. Jobs in the clean energy space are on the rise today, as Illinois transitions to a clean energy future and as the energy industry outpaces growth of other industries nationally, adding more than 300,000 jobs last year alone (USEER 2022).To prepare to meet these demands, ComEd has been working to expand the reach of its career readiness programs, including hosting more frequent climb clinics, expanding test prep, and boosting capacity of its apprenticeship schools to reach more residents interested in careers in utilities. As a result, ComEd has nearly doubled participation in the overhead apprenticeship program in the past two years.Since announcing it would expand craft hiring earlier this year, ComEd has extended hiring offers to over 200 candidates for roles including overhead helpers, as well as construction workers. As interest in craft careers at ComEd has increased, so too has diversity: More than 75 percent of applications to craft roles in 2022 were for minority candidates, and 15 percent for women. This record level of diversity follows on efforts by the company to bolster outreach and recruitment in communities across the service territory, and to reduce barriers to help more qualified applicants get the training they need to compete for these new careers.For more information on how ComEd is helping job seekers prepare for entry-level craft roles, please visit www.comed.com/cleanenergyjobs.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

The steep uptick in drilling works on the back of robust oil and gas prices, together with pricing improvements, meant that the segment turned around from the previous year’s operating loss of $60.7 million to a profit of $92.1 million.Offshore Gulf of Mexico: Revenues of $34.3 million increased 8.9% from the year-ago quarter as activity remained robust. Moreover, margins during the July-September period of 2022 expanded 22.3% year over year, resulting in the segment’s operating profit surged 45.3% from the prior-year period to $9.4 million.International Solutions: The segment’s operations generated revenues of $42.4 million, up from $17.3 million in the corresponding period of 2021 — again due to improved activity levels (primarily in Latin America), with the average number of active rigs jumping 83.3% from 6 to 11. The unit reported a loss of $789,000, significantly narrower than the loss of $5.7 million incurred in the corresponding period a year ago.

The company’s natural gas pipeline assets, spreading roughly 83,000 miles, are responsible for transporting 40% of natural gas consumption and export volumes in the United States.The company generates stable fee-based revenues from its vast network of midstream infrastructure. KMI’s business model is relatively less exposed to commodity price volatility than upstream and downstream companies. It generates significant cash flow from fees charged for leveraging its midstream properties.For 2023, the midstream player expects to generate earnings of $1.12 per share. KMI anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $7.7 billion for 2023, an increase from the $7.5 billion projected for 2022. It expects a total segmental EBDA of $8.2 billion, up 5% from the 2022 forecast.To strengthen the balance sheet, KMI plans to end 2023 with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4 times. With this plan, the company is expecting the ratio for 2023 to be lower than its long-term target of 4.5 times. This will give it significant potential to opportunistically repurchase shares or make additional investments.Kinder Morgan plans to invest $2.1 billion in expansion projects, joint ventures or discretionary capital expenditures, of which 80% will be allocated to low-carbon projects. The company expects higher adjusted core earnings for 2023 as it banks on the higher demand for transporting crude oil, gas liquids and carbon dioxide.Story continuesRisksKinder Morgan’s project backlogs have dropped significantly to only $2.7 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, from the high of $22 billion in mid-2015. The company’s asset base is expected to witness lower volumes due to the volatile energy markets. The significant drop in project backlog is likely to hurt its bottom line.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. HP is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere, having the youngest and most efficient drilling fleet. HP’s fiscal third-quarter 2022 adjusted profit of 27 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents.Helmerich &amp; Payne is expected to see an earnings surge of 277.8% in 2022. HP boasts a strong balance sheet, carrying $542.3 million in long-term debt. The company’s debt-to-capitalization stands at just 16.6% compared with many of its peers that are hugely burdened with debts.Patterson-UTI Energy PTEN is one of the largest North America land drilling contractors, having a large, high-quality fleet of drilling rigs. PTEN’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted net profit of 28 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents.Patterson-UTI is expected to see an earnings surge of 128.5% in 2022. PTEN doubled its quarterly cash dividend to 8 cents per share from the previous 4-cent payout. The dividend will be paid out on Dec 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Dec 1, 2022. PTEN also increased its share repurchase authorization to $300 million.Halliburton Company HAL is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world. HAL’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of 60 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents.HAL is expected to see an earnings surge of 91.7% in 2022. With controlled capital spending and strong demand for its products/services, Halliburton expects to generate strong free cash flows going forward. Nevertheless, we are being conservative with our projections and provide a margin of safety due to the unpredictability of commodity prices.

(NASDAQ:CMCSA) has remained resilient.The diversified entertainment conglomerate's shares have dropped more than 30% over the past 12 months along with the broader communication services sector, making it a potential value opporturtunity.Comcast Is Doing Well Despite the CompetitionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CMCSA. Click here to check it out. CMCSA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CMCSAPeter Lynch Chart of CMCSAWhile an investment in Comcast could be rewarding, it is important for investors to understand the nature of conglomerates when researching their options and pay attention to any developments, whether internal or external, that might affect its stock performance. Despite this, I believe investing in a diversified conglomerate provides considerable peace of mind due to its exposure to a wide number of industries and revenue streams.Furthermore, Comcast is one of the most attractive income options at this time. During the third quarter, the Philadelphia-based company returned a whopping $4.7 billion to shareholders, $3.5 billion of which was in the form of share repurchases. The company also has a fairly high yield of 3.07%, boasting five years of growth in dividend payouts.With its reach across the U.S., Comcast has created a powerful moat. Its investment case is boosted by its low payout ratio, consistently growing dividend yield and strong growth potential. Overall, the company's current status and outlook provide plenty of reasons for investors to be confident in its long-term performance.The Peacock effectThe pandemic brought out several steep changes in the entertainment industry, and it is clear that its future lies in streaming. Among the large number of streaming services available to consumers, Comcast's Peacock platform stands out with its exceptional feature films and series content from NBCUniversal studios and licensed content from other providers.Story continuesWhat sets Peacock apart is its free ad-supported version, which provides limited access to the service. Meanwhile, premium tiers offer exclusive content and full access, further increasing the platform's appeal. It is no wonder that in such a short amount of time since launching in April 2020, Peacock has gained 15 million paid subscribers and 30 million active users, a testament to its rising popularity among viewers looking for a user-friendly streaming service with great content.Peacock has added 70% more paid subscribers year to date, making it one of the fastest-growing streaming services. The company earns around $10 from its subscribers through advertising alone. Even better, Peacock was one of the first streaming services to offer personalized ad-supported subscriptions for free. As such, the service has fantastic potential for long-term growth, and Comcast is keen to make the most of it.The theme park division is on fireOne of the top catalysts for Comcast next year could be its theme park segment. Its park in Orlando closed the popular Shrek 4D ride earlier this year, but management has dropped multiple hints about a possible replacement. Last week, the company put the rumors to bed and announced a new experience based on the Despicable Me/Minions franchise.Comcast announced that Illumination's Villain-Con Minion Blast will join Universal Studios Florida next summer. Visitors will be in for a fun time with interactive blasters available to combat enemies taken straight out of the Minions movies. The adventure will not end there, though, as the nearby restaurant will become the Minion Cafe. The entire area in Universal Studios Florida will be rebranded as Minion Land on Illumination Avenue.Results from the company's theme park segment in its most recent quarter, which ended in September, showed revenue growth of 42%. Moreover, adjusted Ebitda shot up 89% to push through record pre-pandemic levels.TakeawayDespite the short-term industry weaknesses, Comcast is positioned remarkably well against the current market headwinds. It stands out from many other companies with its healthy dividend yield, leaving abundant upside potential for further dividend increases. Moreover, it has multiple growth catalysts in play that are likely to take its revenue, not to mention its share price, to new heights.Some investors may be worried about the company's financial positioning, one of the main reasons its stock has taken a hammering over the past several months. As of the end of the third quarter, it had $97.6 billion in total debt against $5.7 billion in cash and equivalents. Though the discrepancy is a cause for concern, Comcast's business remains solid. And with robust exposure to multiple verticals in its niche, concerns over its future are ill-advised.As such, I believe investing in a conglomerate like Comcast is an attractive and potentially lucrative option for many investors due to its diversified portfolio. This makes it an ideal choice for those investors who are looking to establish a well-balanced portfolio that has the potential to weather fluctuations within the market. With the share price plummeting, I think it now may be a good time for investors to take advantage of potential returns over the long term.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

DHI acquired one of the largest builders in Northwest Arkansas, Riggins Custom Homes. The company expects to pay $170 million for the acquisition, which will expand its local start-up market position in Northwest Arkansas.Shares of D.R. Horton gained 3.5% during the trading session on Dec 15, 2022.The acquisition of Riggins Custom Homes and related assets will add approximately 3,000 lots, 170 homes in inventory and 173 homes in sales order backlog to D.R.

Horton’s growth strategy. The company is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets.

If you want to see more cheap stocks to buy that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.A cheap stock is a stock of a company that's trading for below its intrinsic value.Given that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially this year to fight inflation, the broader market has declined in 2022 and many cheap stocks have become even cheaper this year as their valuations have decreased.In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 7.16%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 29.44% in 2022 as of December 14.As a result of the market decline, there are many stocks that trade for relatively low forward P/E ratios. If there is a recession next year, some of the stocks with the low forward P/E ratios might not look as cheap because many companies might not earn as much as analyst estimates. If companies miss earnings substantially and lower their outlooks, analyst earnings for the future could come down and their forward P/E ratios could go higher.Given forward P/E ratios are not very dependable if companies miss their estimates, some investors use analyst price targets in addition to identifying stocks with competitive advantages to decide whether a stock is cheap or not.2022While the market has declined this year, some cheap stocks have outperformed the broader market for various reasons. Some cheap stocks have experienced strong growth despite macroeconomic headwinds. Other cheap stocks have declined less given the strength and stability of their businesses.As for the future, it remains to be seen whether there will be an economic slowdown in 2023. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022, we picked stocks with substantial competitive advantages that either trade below the average analyst price target or trade for below their intrinsic values.We then filtered the stocks to ensure that they outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date as of December 14.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 202212. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 20.03%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35While the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.7%, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) has surged 20.03% in 2022 given strong earnings. For Q3, the global aerospace and defense company earned $3.26 per share on sales of $10 billion versus the consensus of $3.15 per share on revenue of $9.92 billion. Analysts see more upside in the future given the average target price of $271.25 per share.Alongside Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a cheap stock that has outperformed the market in 2022.11. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 3.78%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37In terms of 2022 when all three major indexes have declined, Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has done relatively well with a rally of 3.78%. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) is considered a defensive stock given its retail stores sell low cost products.Given the high inflation this year, demand for Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) has increased. In Q3 2022, the company's consolidated net sales rose 8.1% year over year to $6.94 billion and its diluted earnings per share increased 25% year over year to $1.20.Considering the quality of its business, analysts like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) as they have an average price target of $165.36 per share. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 37 owned shares of Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) at the end of September, ranking the stock #11 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 10.16%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best performing tech stocks of the year given its 10.16% rally in 2022 as of December 14. Although the stock actually trades slightly higher than the average analyst price target of $141.66 per share, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has substantial long term intrinsic value given its earnings power. If it can succeed in quantum computing, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) would be even more attractive as well.40 hedge funds in our database owned shares of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #10 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.9. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 9.27%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) has rallied 9.27% this year while the broader market has declined given the railroad company's strong earnings results. For Q3, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 and total sales rose 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Analysts have an average price target of $81.86 per share.Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an August investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -1.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Although its stock hasn't done well in the last five years, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) nevertheless outperformed the market in 2022 given its decline of 1.51% versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% year to date. One reason could be AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)'s valuation with its forward P/E ratio of 7.18 as of December 15, which is pretty attractive if the telecom can earn what analysts expect.In terms of expectations, analysts estimate AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) will earn $2.60 per share in 2022, $2.54 per share in 2023, and $2.60 per share in 2024.7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Year to Date Return as of December 14: -6.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67The average analyst thinks there's upside in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) despite the stock of the enterprise software company declining 6.92% year to date. In terms of average estimates, analysts have a price target of $87.25 per share and they estimate Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will earn $4.88 per share in 2023, $5.55 per share in 2024, and $6.33 per share in 2025.67 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #7 on our list of 12 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Outperformed in 2022.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Return as of December 14: 1.40%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares have rallied 1.4% this year, easily outpacing the S&amp;P 500's decline of 16.7% in the same period. Although inflation has been a headwind for a lot of companies this year, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been able to arguably benefit from it by gaining more customers with its low retail prices.Analysts like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) as they have an average price target of $160.50 per share.Like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc.

255,7bc3160d-b62a-3c13-8203-fe75082df3e6,PCAR,2022-12-17,3 Bargain Auto Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying Sooner,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-bargain-auto-stocks-youll-130101717.html,1671195661,STORY,"['MZDAY', 'PCAR', 'HOG']","[Since the beginning of 2022, equity markets have been bearing the brunt of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Rising interest rates, soaring inflation and log-jammed supply chains are dragging companies and the economy down, keeping investors on edge. The Fed has clearly stated that it is in no mood to ease its fight against inflation until the same comes down to its target range in a sustainable fashion. With the Fed expected to maintain its hawkish stance and, consequently, markets remaining volatile, one of the biggest mistakes we can make now is to resort to panic selling. Instead, savvy investors should see this as a buying opportunity.Go Bargain Hunting for Undervalued Auto Stocks  In such volatile and uncertain times, cyclical sectors suffer more. One such sector is Auto-Tires-Trucks . The sector currently carries a Zacks Rank #9, which places it in the bottom 44% of the 16 Zacks sectors. Auto companies are battling severe chip crunch, supply chain snarls and commodity inflation. The sector has plunged around 47% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s decline of around 17%. Amid economic uncertainty, the auto sector’s prospects look muted. So, should investors avoid auto stocks? No.The 2022 pullback has given investors a chance to scoop up strong stocks at attractive entry points, even if near-term volatility remains. Yes, the prices may drop further, but it is practically impossible to predict the bottom. So, investors with longer-term horizons interested in the auto space might consider buying some fundamentally sound stocks at what could look like bargain prices down the road. Bargain stocks typically trade at low valuations, not accurately reflective of their intrinsic value in terms of fundamentals like earnings, cash flow and leverage.PACCAR PCAR, Harley-Davidson HOG and Mazda Motor MZDAY are a few such undervalued auto stocks that you should hit the buy button on now.Story continuesOur MethodologyThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed our search to the aforesaid four stocks that have a favorable combination of a Value Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), with a market capitalization greater than $1 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Value Picks in the Auto SpacePACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup comprising XF and XG models (launched in 2021) and the XD model (launched in 2022) is driving the firm’s revenues.Continued growth in the aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects. Solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind.Valued at around $35 billion, PACCAR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. Over the past month, shares have inched down more than 5%. On the basis of price to earnings (P/E), PACCAR is trading at 12.29X multiple, below its one-year high of 18.10X and also lower than the median of 12.46X. The stock is also valued lower than the industry’s 24.48X. The current levels could be considered a good entry point.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 53.2% and 3.1%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 12.6%.Harley-Davidson: Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson is one of the leading motorcycle makers in the world. In sync with long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, HOG is focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends.Its ‘Hardwire’ plans look to improve effectiveness and contribute to revenue growth. Per the plan, the company remains focused on bolstering its market position by putting more emphasis on sportier bikes and modern marketing strategy. Building on Hardwire strategy, the company announced Hardwire Stage II in May, aiming for increased performance.With a market cap of more than $6 billion, Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A. Over the past month, shares have inched down more than 4.5%. HOG shares currently trade at 9.5X P/E, well below the industry’s 24.48X. Its current P/E also represents a 17.2% discount from its one-year high of 11.48X and closer to the median of 8.80X. Considering its strong prospects, the stock appears to be trading at a fairly reasonable price.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG’s 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 12.4% and 1%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 43.2%.Mazda: Japan-based Mazda engages in the manufacture and sale of passenger cars, commercial vehicles, along with automotive parts. The company is actively focusing on stepping up its e-mobility game, which is the future of transportation. Last month, it pledged to invest $10.6 billion to electrify its lineup of vehicles by 2030. Mazda’s collaboration with its main suppliers, such as Hiroshima Aluminum Industry, Imasen Electric, Ondo Corporation and HIROTEC Corporation, augurs well for the long-term growth of the company as well as the industry. Mazda’s efforts in procuring batteries to expedite its electrification initiatives are noteworthy.Valued at around $5 billion, Mazda currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of A. Over the past month, shares have declined 6%. Shares appear to be trading at a bargain. The company’s P/E ratio currently sits at 4.73X. On a relative basis, the value is beneath its 6.86X one-year median value and high of 9.47X in 2021.The stock's P/E also looks solid versus its industry's average of 7.65X.This definitely looks like an opportunity to buy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MZDAY’s fiscal 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 7% and 24%, respectively. Mazda has targeted about 4.5 trillion yen in net sales for fiscal 2026, indicating a jump of 45% from fiscal 2022. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 81.6%, on average.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to the COVID-19 Two-Year Impact Survey conducted by The American Nurses Foundation, in the United States, almost 52% of nurses thought of leaving their jobs due to heavy workloads and burnout. The implementation of advanced technologies in the healthcare sector has provided the medical device industry a huge boost even during the pandemic.

And welcome to the NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation Corporate Update Conference Call. Today's call will be conducted by the company's Chief Executive Officer, Dave Rosa; and Chief Financial Officer, Ron McClurg. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Rosa, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. Federal securities laws with respect to future operations, financial results, events, trends, and performance, which are based on management's beliefs and assumptions as of today's call or other specified date. Forward-looking statements may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.See NeuroOne's corporate update press release and SEC filings for information regarding specific risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. Except as required by law, NeuroOne undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. With that said, I'll turn the call over to Dave Rosa, CEO of NeuroOne. Please go ahead.Photo by Arseny Togulev on UnsplashDave Rosa: Thanks, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal fourth quarter, we continued to make exciting strides towards commercializing our second diagnostic product line, the Evo sEEG Electrode. In addition, we made substantial development progress with our therapeutic technology, and we increased our financial runway as well. Let's first discuss the progress with commercialization efforts regarding our Evo sEEG product line. We received clearance for less than 30 days use from the FDA in October 2022 for similar indications as our Evo Cortical product line, and now expect to begin the commercial launch with Zimmer Biomet in the first quarter of 2023. sEEG Electrodes represent the bulk of diagnostic procedures performed today due to their less invasive placement by neurosurgeons.Story continuesMany of these procedures currently utilize a robot to enhance precision during electrode placement. We expect the Evo sEEG Electrodes to be used with Zimmer's ROSA robotic platform in the same manner. The company also recently shipped the initial Evo sEEG limited market release order to Zimmer Biomet and is ramping up manufacturing to meet additional orders for a future full product launch. Moving to our OneRF therapeutic ablation electrode system, we had previously reported that we were targeting completion of animal feasibility studies in the fourth calendar quarter, with the potential to complete the product development by the end of calendar year 2022. As a reminder, the system is being designed to both record brain activity and ablate brain tissue using the same electrode.Currently, two separate hospital visits and surgeries, one for diagnostic and one for therapeutic, are required to treat patients that have seizures due to epilepsy. Combining both the diagnostic and therapeutic functions into one device is intended to save time, cost and contribute potentially to improve patient outcomes. We have also discussed our intent to market both the electrode and radiofrequency generator to offer a complete system to our customers. I also previously disclosed that we signed a partnership agreement with RBC Medical Innovations, a recognized leader in the development and manufacturing of electromechanical therapeutic devices, to develop and manufacture our radiofrequency generator. We have now completed the hardware and software prototypes for preliminary design verification tests on the generator.We also successfully completed animal feasibility studies with the assistance of Dr. Robert Gross of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia; and Dr. Jamie Van Gompel at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Now let's discuss our efforts in developing electrodes that can be used for chronic stimulation and recording. We continue to make progress on the testing of these electrodes that are being designed for use in indications such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, back pain due to failed back surgeries, and potentially mental health indications such as severe obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, peripheral pain, and other conditions requiring a permanently implanted electrode that can deliver both diagnostic and therapeutic functions.Our initial focus is to target the spinal cord stimulation market, which currently represents over $3 billion of revenue in the U.S. market. We are designing our devices to utilize percutaneous delivery systems meaning nonsurgical placements, while targeting designs that require less battery energy with expanded coverage of the tissue as compared to current competitive electrodes placed percutaneously. We have also recruited key opinion leaders comprised of both pain specialists and neurosurgeons to help guide in the development of both the electrode and device delivery system. Another area of focus for the company has been the effort to generate pre and post market clinical data to support our technology. In the third and fourth fiscal quarters, the company presented at the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Society for Neuroscience, and American Epilepsy Society conferences.We were also included as part of the National Institute of Health submissions with the University of Minnesota to develop a cortical electrode that would with potential assistance from Medtronic plugged directly into a Medtronic pulse generator that could provide both sensing and stimulation functionality built into one electrode. The intent would also be to place the electrode through a less invasive procedure that is typically required to place cortical electrodes. From a financial standpoint, we received an accelerated $3.5 million payment from Zimmer Biomet related to certain milestone events as part of an amendment to our distribution and development agreement. This strengthens the company's financial position by providing greater runway, without having to approach the currently challenging financial markets.I'll now turn it over to Ron for a brief update on the status of our financial reporting. Ron?See also 10 Cheap Small Cap Stocks To Buy and Top 15 Digital Transformation Companies in the US.Ron McClurg: Thank you, Dave. We have not yet filed our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. We will provide the full financial results, when our independent registered public accounting firm completes its audit procedures. As of September 30, 2022, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $11.1 million. We also had no debt outstanding as of September 30, 2022. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it back to Dave. Dave?Dave Rosa: Thanks, Ron. And looking at the past fiscal year, I'm very proud to highlight some of our accomplishments. We completed a public offering, raising gross proceeds of $13.35 million. We've received a $3.5 million accelerated payment from our distribution partner, Zimmer Biomet related to certain milestone events. We successfully completed feasibility testing of our OneRF ablation system, facilitated by Dr. Robert Gross of Emory University and Dr. Jamie Van Gompel at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. We completed initial testing for our chronic use electrode platform. We received 510(k) clearance of our second product line, the Evo sEEG Electrode product family for less than 30 day use. We received and shipped the initial order from Zimmer Biomet for our Evo sEEG Electrodes, and we rang the NASDAQ Stock Market closing bell to commemorate our FDA clearance milestone for the Evo sEEG Electrode technology.In closing, the company made great progress in fiscal 2022 in a wide variety of areas, including commercialization, development, and capital raises, which will allow us to continue to execute our plan, with the intent to introduce meaningful advances in electrode technology for a wide variety of neurological applications. I want to thank you for your time and attention. I want to wish you a wonderful holiday season, and I look forward to providing future updates on our progress.Operator:]"

An uptick in M&amp;A deals, strong earnings performance, new drug approvals, a favorable regulatory environment and pipeline successes helped the sector turn around.While the broader market is grappling with rising interest rates and inflation, innovation — the sector’s driving force — continues to take place, with the trend expected to continue in 2023. M&amp;A in the drug and biotech sector is also expected to pick up noticeably.It is a defensive sector to invest in the present environment of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.Several companies in the drug and biotech sector have returned 40% or more in 2022 so far and have room for more growth in 2023. Here we discuss four such companies, Merck MRK, Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, Immunocore Holdings IMCR, and Immunovant IMVT.MerckBased in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer and alone accounting for around 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil vaccines to prevent HPV-related cancers, are boosting Merck’s sales performance.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. Merck’s Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth, with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023.

With its four CF medicines, Vertex treats the majority of the 83,000 patients living with CF in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. Vertex’s CF sales continue to grow driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups in the United States are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher. Vertex faces only minimal competition in its core CF franchise.While Vertex’s main focus is the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- to late-stage pipeline in seven additional diseases like acute pain, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and cell therapy for type I diabetes. Many of these candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Programs in five disease areas are now entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Norfolk Southern:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$39b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Norfolk Southern has an ROCE of 13%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern roceIn the above chart we have measured Norfolk Southern's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Norfolk Southern here  for free.What Can We Tell From Norfolk Southern's ROCE Trend?Norfolk Southern is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 31% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To bring it all together, Norfolk Southern has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 90% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Norfolk Southern can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Norfolk Southern that you might find interesting.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.45 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.95 billion, up 5.1% from the prior-year quarter.KO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.48 per share and revenue of $42.8 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.9% and +10.72%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

268,17a28348-4033-3f2c-9778-6653a2ad2789,INTU,2022-12-17,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-intuit-inc-110044626.html,1671274844,STORY,['INTU'],"[Does the December share price for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Intuit The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.19bUS$4.99bUS$5.64bUS$6.49bUS$7.47bUS$8.20bUS$8.80bUS$9.31bUS$9.74bUS$10.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x11Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.68%Est @ 7.37%Est @ 5.75%Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$3.9kUS$4.3kUS$4.5kUS$4.8kUS$5.2kUS$5.3kUS$5.2kUS$5.2kUS$5.0kUS$4.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$181bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$181b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$87bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$135b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$385, the company appears about fair value at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuit as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for IntuitStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

However, shares of the company are down 1.7% since Dec 12, especially due to the broader market sell-off on Dec 15, following hawkish Fed minutes.The Citrefix anchor system uses Stryker’s award-winning bioresorbable material, Citregen — which is designed to mimic the chemistry and structure of native bone.Stryker’s shares have lost 8.3% this year compared with the industry’s decline of 43%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.5% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSignificance of the LaunchStryker believes that the recently launched anchor system will benefit its customers from the expanded use of one of the most innovative bioresorbable materials available for use in foot and ankle procedures. The specially designed Citregen used in the Citrefix anchor system will likely lead to controlled resorption without chronic inflammation. The unique chemical and mechanical properties of Citregen will also help grafted tissue heal and healthy bone to grow when used in orthopedic surgical applications.Using the Citrefix anchor system will provide orthopedic surgeons with a system that has higher pull-out strength compared with other suture anchors. The new system will come in a sterile-packed set that will include a cartridge with a preloaded implant and eyelet, a drill bit, a drill guide and a pre-assembled inserter.The launch of the Citrefix anchor system expands Stryker’s Citregen portfolio, which will be further expanded with new launches in 2023. Last year, the company launched its first product using Citregen — Citrelock. The product had a successful launch.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Future Market Insights, the foot and ankle devices market is anticipated to account for $4.4 billion in 2022. It is anticipated to reach $7.8 billion by 2032 at a CAGR of 5.9%. Factors like the use of bioresorbable implants and the emergence of technological advancements are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the recent full-market release is likely to provide a boost to Stryker’s business globally.Stryker Corporation Price Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderStryker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, Merit Medical Systems MMSI and HealthEquity HQY, each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

DVA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $55.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for DaVita shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, DaVita is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry that ranks in the Bottom 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.08 per share to 88 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about DaVita right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

In addition, the company will establish a 2030 scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 30 percent, relative to a 2020 baseline and in accordance with guidelines from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The company's previously announced goal to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from global operations by 2050 remains unchanged.""We believe a more ambitious GHG reduction target is achievable and will create substantial value for all of our stakeholders,"" said Peter Vanacker, CEO of LyondellBasell. ""Reducing emissions while simultaneously building a world-class Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is needed to meet the demands we are seeing throughout the value chain.  This approach is not only good for society, but also good for business. We will follow a disciplined approach to prioritize high-return projects and will continue to meet our return expectations.""Estimates of the capital expenditures necessary to achieve its emissions reduction goals are built into the company's long-range plan. These investments are not expected to represent a significant portion of total capital expenditures over the next three years, nor change the capital allocation strategy. While many of the GHG emissions reduction projects are still in the early stages of development, the company will evaluate, pursue and prioritize its GHG emission investments based on each project's rate of return.LyondellBasell will submit its climate goals to SBTi to be validated against SBTi guidance.

This is expected to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by more than 3 million metric tons annually and scope 3 emissions by approximately 40 million metric tons annually.LyondellBasell also aims to secure at least 75 percent of its global electricity from low carbon power by 2030, a majority of which will come from its existing goal to procure a minimum of 50 percent of global electricity from renewable sources.Many of the GHG emissions reduction initiatives planned for implementation by 2030 will begin in 2024 and beyond as the company leverages existing asset turnaround schedules for its largest sites, including:Process heat recovery projects, electrification of a large process turbine and optimization of steam demand at its site in Wesseling, Germany in 2024Optimization of heated equipment through advanced digitization, efficiency improvements and fuel management at its site in Channelview, Texas in 2025In addition, the company's previously announced Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business will focus on achieving its goal to produce and market 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030, further reducing scope 3 emissions.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, for US$8.0m worth of shares, at about US$543 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$524. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.0m for 2.24k shares. On the other hand they divested 69.78k shares, for US$35m. In total, UnitedHealth Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.UnitedHealth Group Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. In total, Executive VP &amp; Chief People Office Erin L. McSweeney sold US$244k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$1.7b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth Group Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought UnitedHealth Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since UnitedHealth Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 3.25% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.19% in that time.Estee Lauder will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Estee Lauder to post earnings of $1.29 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 57.14%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.55 billion, down 17.87% from the year-ago period.EL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.35 per share and revenue of $16.54 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -26.1% and -6.76%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Estee Lauder. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

281,a0bf3ad2-2aac-3fa7-9c44-cfe0cdc2a754,EL,2022-12-17,7 Stocks on the Cusp of a Breakout,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-cusp-breakout-190927850.html,1670958567,STORY,"['BAC', 'IBM', 'SHLS', 'XPEV', 'INMD', 'MGM', 'EL', 'RACE']","[It’s time to look for strong, potential breakout stocks. All as the outlook for the U.S. economy and the overall stock market start to improve. For one, there are multiple signs that the economy is not headed for a significant downturn.  In fact, in an interview with CNBC, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan said the yield-curve inversion is not a sign of an imminent recession, but rather due to the attractiveness of the U.S. and of the American dollar.Meanwhile, despite all the hand-wringing about higher consumer debt, America’s household debt to GDP ratio actually fell sharply to 75.6% in July 2022 from 80% in Jan. 2021 and is little changed from 74.9% in July 2019.  Finally, with inflation expectations dropping and most experts agreeing that inflation will continue to fall, inflation and the Fed seem less worrisome. Given all of these points, medium-term and long-term investors should look for breakout stocks to buy at this point.For this article, I looked for stocks that were trading above their key, 50-day, and 100-day moving averages. I also tried to find names with solid volume, underlying fundamentals, and high relative strength scores. Each of the stocks on this list will only have some of, not all of, these attributes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRACEFerrari$224.27INMDInmode$37.49ELEstee Lauder$247.31XPEVXpeng$10.34SHLSShoals Technologies$25.58IBMInternational Business Machines$150.45MGMMGM Resorts$37.04Breakout Stocks: Ferarri (RACE)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksFerarri (NYSE:RACE) closed on Dec. 12 at $222.53, well above its 50-day moving average of $202.69 and its 200-day moving average of $200.96. Additionally, the relative strength score of RACE stock is a strong 88, showing that it belongs on this list of breakout stocks.Better, higher-end consumers are still splurging, which is great news for Ferrari. In fact, the CEO of Saks Fifth Avenue’s e-commerce unit noted, “We’re still getting the big growth online that we want. Compared to the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019, Saks’ [gross merchandise value] sales increased 115 percent,” as reported by Yahoo Finance.Story continuesSo high-end consumers are still splurging. I think the Street is starting to internalize that message, and, consequently, RACE stock is starting to rev up.Breakout Stocks: InMode (INMD)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comInMode (NASDAQ:INMD), which develops minimally invasive technologies used to enhance patients’ appearance, closed at $36.78 on Dec. 12. According to Yahoo Finance, InMode’s 50-day moving average on that day was $34.32, while its 200-day moving average was $31.38.From Oct. 26, the day before InMode reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, until Dec. 12,  its shares have climbed 7%. From Sept. 28 to Dec. 12, INMD stock soared 27%.  The shares are not far from $38.39, the level at which they closed on Nov. 30. That was their highest close since March 30. According to Investor’s Business Daily, InMode’s Relative Strength rating is 87 out of 100.As I’ve noted in previous columns, I believe that the company is benefiting from consumers’ increased spending on their appearances as they travel to see friends and family and resume working in offices and attending social events. Additionally, the shares’ price-earnings multiple should rise as fears about the economy and sky-high interest rates recede.Breakout Stocks: Estee Lauder (EL)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockEstee Lauder (NYSE: EL) closed on Dec. 12 at $244.44, well above its 50-day moving average of $217.39. It’s also closing in on its 200-day moving average of $248.23.  The Dec. 12 close represented the name’s highest closing level since Sept. 14.On Nov. 2, the cosmetics maker reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.37, versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.29. The company’s top line climbed 2% year-over-year and was in line with the mean estimate. Going forward, the company, which has a sizeable business in China, is poised to benefit a great deal from the reopening of that country.On Nov. 2, in reaction to the Q3 results, 7.67 million of EL’s shares changed hands, versus the stock’s current three-month average volume of 2 million.  On Nov. 2,  the stock dropped to $189.38 from $206.13 the previous day. However, on Nov. 4, it climbed to $209.89 on high volume of 6.16 million. On Nov. 30, EL stock jumped to $235.79 from $214.94 on Nov. 29. The volume on Nov. 30 was a strong 3.4 million.Breakout Stocks: Xpeng (XPEV)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) is well-positioned to get a big boost from the reopening of China.  The shares closed on Dec. 12 at $10.47, significantly above their 50-day moving average of $8.75. And while, after struggling for many months, the stock is still well below its 200-day moving average of $20.52, the shares soared an electrifying 51.5% (3.56/6.91) between Nov. 26 and Dec. 12.Meanwhile, financial-news pundits are starting to notice that the company is becoming a leader in the autonomous-driving race. In a column published last week, for example, I wrote that Xpev “looks poised to become a self-driving pioneer in China.” And on Dec. 10, Seeking Alpha columnist Juxtaposed Ideas stated that “XPEV may potentially outperform at a price target of $62.75…significantly boosted by its promising autonomous progress.”It appears that the combination of the reopening of China, combined with Xpeng’s strides in self-driving vehicles, is causing institutional investors to start buying XPEV stock. In recent weeks, the shares have rallied on larger than normal volume. For example, on Dec. 2, XPEV stock soared to $11.45 from $9.97 on the previous day. Nearly 95 million shares of XPEV x changed hands on Dec. 2. And on Nov. 30, 173.5 million shares of XPEV were traded, with the shares bouncing to $10.81 from $7,34 on the previous day. XPEV reported its third-quarter results on Nov. 30.Shoals Technologies (SHLS)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA maker of components for solar-energy projects, Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) has also gotten a boost recently from events involving China.  More specifically, two actions taken by the Biden Administration towards Chinese solar producers should help ensure that there are enough solar panels to meet the demand for them in the U.S. As a result, Shoals should be able to sell more of its products and turn more of its large backlog into revenue.On Dec. 2, U.S. Customs agreed to allow ” a significant shipment of solar panels” made by China’s JinkoSolar to be released into the market. The agency had held the panels because it was suspected that they had been made by slaves in violation of American law. Also on Dec. 2, the Commerce Department determined that several Chinese panel makers, including JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), had not been avoiding U.S. tariffs by manufacturing their panels in Southeast Asian countries.Shoals closed on Dec. 12 at $24.05, above its 50-day moving average of $23.84 and its 200-day moving average of $19.85. The shares advanced about 20% between Sept. 26 and Dec. 12. On Dec. 2, the name closed at $24.79, up from $23.30 on the previous day, as 17.3 million shares of SHLS changed hands. Over the last three months, the stock’s average trading volume is 2.46 million.IBM (IBM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock closed on Dec. 12 at $149.21, well above its 50-day moving average of $136.76 and its 200-day moving average of $133.28.  The shares closed very close to their 52-week high of $150.46. IBM’s shares have a very strong relative strength rating of 92 and an A+ Accumulation/Distribution rating, which indicates that institutional investors have been buying many shares of the stock over the last 13 weeks.On Oct. 19, IBM reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, as its top line climbed 6.4% year-over-year and it generated $800 million of free cash flow. For all of 2022, the tech giant, whose cloud business has been rapidly growing, predicted that its free cash flow would be roughly $10 billion. On Oct. 20, the day after IBM reported its Q3 results, its shares climbed to $126.79, versus their prior day close of $121.07. On Oct. 20, 13.6 million shares of IBM changed hands, versus the current three–month average trading volume of 4.67 million.MGM Resorts (MGM)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comMGM (NYSE:MGM) closed on Dec. 12 at $36.90, above its 50-day moving average of $34.64 and its 200-day moving average of $35.17.  The shares have a fairly good relative strength rating of 81. On Dec. 5, Barry Jonas, an analyst at investment bank Truist, upgraded MGM stock to “buy” from “hold.” Moreover, he increased his price target on the name to $50 from $40. The analyst expects MGM to beat the stock market next year, as conferences return to Las Vegas and the city benefits from a high number of popular events. Jonas called the stock’s valuation “compelling.”Moreover, as I’ve pointed out in the past, the company’s joint venture, BetMGM, which specializes in sports betting, is expected to start generating positive EBITDA in 2023. On Dec. 5, the shares closed at $37.80, up from $37.08 on Dec. 4. On Dec. 5, 5.58 million shares of the stock changed hands, versus the name’s current three-month average trading volume of  3.18 million.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in XPEV, SHLS, MGM, and JKS.

GIS is likely to register top-and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Dec 20, 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $5.15 billion, suggesting an increase of 2.5% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has moved up by a penny in the last seven days to $1.06 per share, indicating a 7.1% jump from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.We expect fiscal second-quarter net revenues to be up 1.6% year over year to $5,106.7 million and the bottom line to improve 4.7% to $1.04 a share.The manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer food products has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.1%, on average. In the last reported quarter, General Mills delivered an earnings surprise of 11%.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Mills, Inc. price-eps-surprise | General Mills, Inc. Quote Things To NoteGeneral Mills has been benefiting from its Accelerate strategy, which aids in making the choices of how to win and where to play to boost profitability and enhance shareholder returns. Under how to win, General Mills is focused on four pillars — brand building, undertaking innovations, unleashing scale and maintaining business strength. Where to play principle is outlined to enhance its capabilities to generate profitability through geographic and product prioritization and portfolio restructuring.Strength in the Pet segment has been an important growth driver for General Mills. A higher pet population and more humanization and premiumization of pet food since the pandemic have been acting as tailwinds for General Mills’ pet food category. The persistence of these upsides is likely to have contributed to GIS’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance.However, the company is grappling with cost inflation. In this regard, elevated labor, energy and transportation costs are headwinds. The company is also battling supply-chain bottlenecks. General Mills’ international presence exposes it to risks of unfavorable currency rates. We believe that the persistence of these factors might be a concern for the quarter to be reported.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for General Mills this time around.

UDR has properties located throughout the United States, which includes a mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations. The company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with respect to geographies and price points limit its exposure to volatility and concentration risks alongside assuring stable cash flows.Additionally, a favorable demographic trend in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent, is likely to fuel the demand for UDR’s properties.UDR is also leveraging technological investments and process enhancements to drive innovation and margin expansion. Its Next Generation Operating Platform supports electronical interaction, provides service to residents and aids its business prospects. These efforts are likely to give the company a competitive edge over its peers.The company maintains a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited third-quarter 2022 with $1.1 billion of liquidity. The company has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule and no consolidated maturities until 2024.Also, investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1(Stable) and BBB+(Stable) from Moody's Investors Service and S&amp;P Global Ratings, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With enough financial flexibility, UDR is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and UDR remains committed to that. It has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 4.22%. Given its solid financial position and strong cash flows from operations, the company’s dividend payment seems sustainable.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 7.7% in the past three months compared with its industry’s fall of 9.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, stiff competition from other housing alternatives like rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes restricts UDR from raising rents, stalling its growth pace. Moreover, regulatory restrictions regarding rent control or rent stabilization by certain states and municipalities have been limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees.UDR’s huge development pipeline, although encouraging for long-term growth, is a matter of concern as it exposes the company to various operational risks, such as a rise in construction costs, entitlement delays, lease-up risks and funding risks.Further, rising interest rates are likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Chatham Lodging Trust REIT CLDT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Again, second-quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.1 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $630 million was for land development and $260 million was to acquire land.For the third quarter, the company invested $1.75 billion in lots, land and development, of which $890 billion was for finished lots, $680 million for land development and $180 million was allotted to acquire land. For the fourth quarter, the company invested $1.5 billion in lots, land and development, of which $780 billion was for finished lots, $560 million for land development and $150 million was allotted to acquire land.The company has selectively invested in attractively-priced land and lots in the past few years, allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets. D.R.

288,562c6cd2-4bb6-39b4-abc5-287f6c088501,AFL,2022-12-17,Our Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-stock-picks-2023-195312363.html,1670961192,STORY,"['AFL', 'INTC', 'FVRR', 'LLY', 'VZ', 'META', 'PYPL', 'WBA', 'FLO']","[Before we discuss the top 10 stock picks for 2023, we can all agree that the economy has two pathways from here. One, the real impact of the rate hikes sits in front of us and will trigger a deep recession in 2023. Two, the rate hikes in 2022 were appropriate for the level of inflation, and the market will steadily recover in 2023 as rates stabilize. To figure out which path is more likely, let’s take a look at this chart:chart comparing Fed funds rate to the S&amp;P500Source: Charts by TradingViewEffective Fed Funds Rate vs the S&amp;P500We can see that, historically, the stock market continued on an uptrend during a rate hike environment. The stock market only went into a deep correction after a lag of at least a year and a half after considerable rate hikes. In 2022 though, the market is heading down while interest rates go up, with little delay. That doesn’t look good.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsConversely, a sensible way to explain this is that things are much more fast-paced in 2022. People can hit sell on their phones a few seconds after getting the news of a rate hike. Moreover, the pace of rate hikes currently is much faster than the ones two decades ago.The takeaway here is that no one can accurately predict what 2023 holds. Either Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell engineers a soft landing, or companies, with a collective debt of $24 trillion, will have to significantly reduce their headcount to make interest payments.With that in mind, it is critical to find a balance between both of these outcomes before investing. Your assets shouldn’t collapse in the worst-case scenario, nor should they miss out on a bullish stock market. The following ten stock picks for 2023 maintain this balance between upside potential and safety:Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is an outstanding stock to consider investing in. The company’s performance compared to other pharmaceuticals is remarkable and is up more than 35% this year alone. They have also reported much better than expected profits last quarter. Net profit margin is up by 30% year-on-year to nearly 21% at a time when most other companies are seeing margin compression. Thus, the premium for the stock is certainly justified.Story continuesIn addition, they have recently been accepted for review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an accelerated approval pathway for donanemab. The Alzheimer’s drug by Lilly is very promising and has delivered much more success in clinical trials than competitors. The company states, “Donanemab reduced brain amyloid plaque levels vs. baseline by 65.2% compared with 17.0% for Aduhelm® at 6 months.”At the same time, they are well-positioned in the Type-2 diabetes market, which is likely to grow for years. That is a lot of diversification within the pharmaceutical industry, and I see more upside as profits increase.Finally, Eli Lilly makes substantial investments in capital and operating expenses to further its growth. All these factors combined make LLY stock quite attractive for investors looking for long-term growth potential far beyond 2023.Flowers Foods (FLO)bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display caseSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphotoSpeaking about stocks that provide safety and retain upside, Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) is a no-brainer. The bakery company has solid fundamentals and has been consistently beating expectations. In the latest quarter, top-line growth was well above double digits at 12.7%, while net profits increased despite declining margins. Moreover, Flowers Foods’ recession resistance is great because it is in the bakery business.Furthermore, FLO stock is up 6% year-to-date, outperforming all major stock indices, while its 5-year gain is almost identical to the S&amp;P 500. Combined with the stock’s compelling yield of 3.04%, I wouldn’t sleep on FLO.Meta Platforms (META)An image of a VR headset and headphones; the word metaverse on the headsetSource: PopTika/ShutterstockWhile many see Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as a failing company, they need to look deeper. Admittedly, not many people are interested in the metaverse, and spending billions on it might not be the smartest of ideas. The potential market for virtual reality products is still small, and everyone socializing in a VR world designed by Meta isn’t plausible. At least not in 2023.However, suppose we were to put Meta’s expenditure on the metaverse out of the picture. In that case, we’re looking at a tech company that owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, valued at 11x earnings. That is quite the discount.In the first nine months of this year, Meta’s “Family of Apps” made $9.34 billion in operating income, while Reality Labs lost $3.67 billion. If Meta reduces their spending on Reality Labs and reduces its headcount, we are looking at an irresistible valuation. Further, profit margins will improve as advertising revenue inevitably picks up. So, even if Meta keeps spending on its metaverse endeavor, I expect a lot of upside for the stock.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is an excellent choice for investors seeking a safe and passive income source. The company has a solid business model based on its over 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides healthcare services to the U.S. and U.K. In addition, the stock boasts a high dividend yield of 4.68%, far higher than its competitor CVS Health’s (NYSE:CVS) 2.12%.Furthermore, Walgreens has raised its dividend for 46 years consecutively, with a comfortable payout ratio of 43%. Additionally, the company has started a significant growth initiative in its consumer health segment, which is beginning to take off. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s clinics generated $596 million in revenue. The income from the health segment will be an essential source of growth for the company as the VillageMD partnership yields better results incrementally.However, investors should be aware that the initiatives may not significantly boost the top line, and the stock will likely still underperform as the retail pharma sector is not a hot one. But for those looking for a stable and passive income source, WBA stock is a great option.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is a household name and is among the biggest insurance companies in the U.S. The insurance business is inelastic, and Aflac will undoubtedly profit from that inelasticity. Of course, it is a supplemental insurance company, but consumers are still willing to pay for an additional layer of safety.Aflac has proven to be resilient during times of crisis, as evidenced by its sound financial performance during the pandemic. Finally, the company has strong investment-grade credit ratings, assuring it will meet its debt obligations and pay its dividend.AFL stock also includes its relatively high dividend yield of 2.37%, a low payout ratio of 30.78%, and 39 years of dividend increase consecutively. However, that’s not all. Aflac has consistently outperformed analysts’ expectations and is up 21.5% YTD due to its steadily increasing dividend and attractive valuation metrics. Despite that, it is still trading at a price-earnings ratio of 9 times.Intel Corporation (INTC)Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comDespite its recent struggles and declining stock price, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) remains a major industry player and an attractive option for investors. Despite the decline, the company still generates massive revenues and offers a dividend yield significantly higher than many other tech stocks at 5%.Furthermore, INTC’s selloff has turned it into a value stock, quickly becoming among the best stock picks for 2023. The company’s importance will also prevent it from losing relevancy anytime soon, as its products are essential for computer manufacturers.Of course, there is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) threatening Intel’s dominance. However, Intel invests heavily in new foundries to regain its technical lead and become a player in the foundry business. Its ambitious European investment plans will also positively affect industries and member states. It is also valued at a much steeper discount than AMD.I believe with Intel’s current revenue levels and dividend yield, investors may have a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. Intel’s stock chart shows that the market appears bearish on the company, but there is still plenty of upside for investors who are patient and willing to take a chance on the industry pioneer.Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&amp;T (T)a picture of cell towers during daytimeSource: ShutterstockInvestors may consider buying Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. trades at a significant discount. Its PE ratio of 8.2x screams a buy since the valuation is nearly at a decade’s low. Verizon also boasts 114.6 million wireless retail connections and can spend less cash on aggressive marketing campaigns or expanding its 5G networks. Alongside that, VZ stock has a dividend yield of 6.88%, which has increased for 17 years consecutively.On the other hand, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) trades at a slightly lower valuation but offers less dividend yield. Their fundamentals are similar, providing an excellent buying opportunity at record lows.Regardless, the most significant concern I have about both of these stocks is their cash-to-debt level. If rates keep increasing, both Verizon and AT&amp;T might find themselves in distress. Still, these concerns are priced in already, and I see a steady recovery for both VZ and T stock in 2023.PayPal Holdings (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a top-rated payment processing company with a strong network and technological and scale advantages. The stock is at a 76% discount since its selloff in June last year, and investors should now consider buying PayPal stock as it is quite oversold.The company’s profits have turned a corner in the latest quarter, and top-line growth remains robust. I see no reason why the stock should be trading at 2018 valuations, even with slower growth. The company has an astounding total payment volume, and its engagement is rising, making it a cash machine. It is one of the most prominent players in the online payments space, and Wall Street’s take on the stock is positive.Its selloff in post-Q3 earnings was driven by worries over the competition, supply chain issues, and stimulus rolling off. Still, these concerns are short-term and unlikely to have a large market reaction. PayPal is available in most countries that support online money transfers and is among the go-to payment methods worldwide.PayPal is a growth stock that I believe will surge in 2023. The payment network is simply too influential to be stuck at its current level in the long run.Fiverr International (FVRR)The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.Source: Temitiman / Shutterstock.comInvestors should consider buying Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) stock due to its enormous growth potential. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the global freelancing market, estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This potential is further amplified by the acceleration of the freelancer market brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Fiverr’s unique combination of lightning-quick sales growth and sector-leading gross margins position it as an established leader in its industry and room for multiple winners in the freelancer sector.Sure, FVRR stock is down 90% from its pandemic high, but that doesn’t mean it’s dead. Fiverr is becoming the go-to marketplace for people looking to hire freelancers for almost anything. The company is spending heavily on marketing, bringing in an inflow of customers. Moreover, the unique thing about Fiverr is that the company’s customer retention levels are remarkable.As these customers stack up, the company is incrementally improving its revenue in the long run despite short-term losses. I easily see this stock providing multibagger within a few years, which is why Fiverr is among the top stock picks for 2023.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 1.11% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.85%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.1%.Heading into today, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 0.12% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 3.25% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.19% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from PepsiCo as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 9, 2023. In that report, analysts expect PepsiCo to post earnings of $1.64 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 7.19%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $26.71 billion, up 5.78% from the year-ago period.PEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.76 per share and revenue of $85.1 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +7.99% and +7.08%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. PepsiCo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, PepsiCo is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 26.68. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.44.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that PEP currently has a PEG ratio of 3.52. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Beverages - Soft drinks was holding an average PEG ratio of 3.09 at yesterday's closing price.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

291,37b5db76-74cc-399c-9bff-48366c3eefe5,PEP,2022-12-17,"Exclusive-PepsiCo to roll out 100 Tesla Semis in 2023, exec says",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-pepsico-roll-100-tesla-220550537.html,1671228350,STORY,"['PEP', 'WMT', 'KR', 'TSLA']","[By Jessica DiNapoli and Hyunjoo JinNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -PepsiCo plans to roll out 100 heavy-duty Tesla Semis in 2023, when it will start using the electric trucks to make deliveries to customers like Walmart and Kroger, the soda maker's top fleet official told Reuters on Friday.PepsiCo Inc, which ordered the big trucks in 2017, is purchasing them ""outright"" and is also upgrading its plants, including installing four 750-kilowatt Tesla Inc charging stalls at both its Modesto and Sacramento locations in California, PepsiCo Vice President Mike O'Connell said in an interview. A $15.4 million state grant and $40,000 federal subsidy per vehicle helps offset part of the costs.""It's a great starting point to electrify,"" said O'Connell, who oversees the company's fleet of vehicles.""Like any early technology, the incentives help us build out the program,"" he said, adding that there were ""lots"" of development and infrastructure costs.PepsiCo is the first company to experiment with the battery-powered Tesla Semis as a way of cutting its environmental impact.United Parcel Service Inc and food delivery company Sysco Corp have also reserved the trucks, while retailer Walmart Inc is testing alternatives.PepsiCo's plans to use the Semis have been reported, but O'Connell provided new details on how the company is using them and its timeline for deploying them. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk initially said the trucks would be in production by 2019, but that was delayed due to battery constraints.PepsiCo said it plans to deploy 15 trucks from Modesto and 21 from Sacramento. It is unclear where the others will be based but O'Connell said the firm is targeting rolling out the Semis in the central United States next, and then the East Coast.The company's Frito-Lay division sells lightweight food products, making it a good candidate for electric trucks, which have heavy batteries that could limit cargo capacity.Story continuesThe Semis will haul Frito-Lay food products for around 425 miles (684 km), but for heavier loads of sodas, the trucks will initially do shorter trips of around 100 miles (160 km), O'Connell said. PepsiCo then will also use the Semis to haul beverages in the ""400 to 500 mile range as well,"" O'Connell said.""Dragging a trailer full of chips around is not the most intense, tough ask,"" said Oliver Dixon, senior analyst at consultancy Guidehouse.""I still believe that Tesla has an awful lot to prove to the broader commercial vehicle marketplace,"" Dixon said, citing Tesla's unwillingness to offer information on payload and pricing.PepsiCo has earmarked some of the trucks planned for the Sacramento location to make deliveries to Walmart and grocers such as Kroger Co and Albertsons Cos Inc. The trucks at the Modesto Frito-Lay plant have just gone to PepsiCo distribution centers, O'Connell said.All of the Semis going to PepsiCo will have a 500-mile (805-km) range. O'Connell added that he is not aware of when Tesla will start deploying 300-mile (480-km) trucks. When Tesla starts building them, PepsiCo ""will rotate those up"" into its fleet, he said.PepsiCo declined to share details on the price of the trucks, a figure that Tesla has kept quiet. Competing vehicles sell for $230,000 to $240,000, said Mark Barrott of consulting firm Plante Moran. He added that the 500-mile range Tesla Semi could be priced higher because its 1,000-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack is about twice the size of many of its rivals.""We keep the trucks for a million miles, seven years,"" O'Connell said. ""The operating costs over time will pay back.""The Gatorade maker declined to share specifics on the weight of the trucks, another closely guarded secret by Tesla.He said Tesla did not help pay for the trucks' megachargers but provided design and engineering services for the facilities, which come with solar and battery storage systems.O'Connell said that a 425-mile (684-km) trip carrying Frito-Lay products brings the Semi's battery down to roughly 20%, and recharging it takes around 35 to 45 minutes.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Hyun Joo Jin in San Francisco; additional reporting by Joe White and Siddharth Cavale; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Rosalba O'Brien)]"
292,e73db983-9ad8-33c5-ba73-6358bba6b107,PEP,2022-12-17,11 Best Sugar Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-sugar-stocks-buy-194633005.html,1671219993,STORY,"['LC=F', 'SB=F', 'FC=F', 'EAST', 'TROLB', 'PEP', 'HSY', 'BG', 'AGRO', 'FREE']","[In this article, we shall discuss the 11 best sugar stocks to buy now. To skip our detailed analysis of global food and agribusiness trends and the sugar industry, go directly and see 5 Best Sugar Stocks to Buy Now.According to a report by McKinsey and Company, food and agribusiness have an enormous economic and social footprint. The industry is worth more than $5 trillion and it represents nearly 11% of global consumer spending, 40% of employment, and nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. If current trends persevere, caloric demand is projected to increase by nearly 70% by 2050. And although resource constraints, like unbridled water demand in 2030 and the rampant degradation of arable land, continue to hamstring the sector, demand for human consumption is likely to double by 2050. To capitalize on this opportunity, investors are pouring money into agribusiness in an effort to capture value from the intrinsic technological innovation and discontinuities in food and agriculture. Evidently, global investments in the industry have tripled since 2004, to more than $160 billion in 2020, according to the report. On average, the agribusiness sector has generated greater total returns to shareholders than other industries historically.The production, processing, and marketing of sugar is an enormous part of the global agribusiness sector, with over 210 million tonnes of sugar produced in 2021. As of 2022, there are more than 123 sugar-producing countries in the world, with the largest players being Brazil, India, Thailand, China, and the United States. However, only 30% of the global produce is traded on the international market. As little to no major sugar producers are listed on major U.S. stock exchanges, investors must deploy a unique approach to capitalize upon the sugar market. They must seek companies which produce sugar along with other agricultural products or as part of a diversified portfolio, like Bunge Ltd. (NYSE:BG). In addition, several notable consumer staple stocks and food companies, like The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) and PepsiCo Inc.

Recovering steadily from the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable weather conditions across all regions, the market is undergoing prominent growth all around the world due to certain drivers such as the rampant expansion of food processing activities in developing markets such as Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa. Another significant growth driver for the industry is the global increase in demand for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, skyrocketing demand for baked goods, yogurt, and confectionary is anticipated to drive the sugar market growth in the 2022-2025 analysis period. Most of the projected growth in sugar production is expected to come from Brazil and India, the two leading producers and exporters of sugar in the world; both countries account for more than 40% of global sugar production collectively. Moreover, as overall income increases and urbanization in developing countries begins to pick up, global average per-capita consumption is also expected to increase.Photo by Victoria Priessnitz on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we looked at Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 920 elite hedge funds and identified some of the most popular stocks which produce and process sugar, or use processed sugar as an ingredient in their product portfolio.

(NASDAQ:FREE) to $11 from $14, maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. According to the analyst, improved branded CPG segment sales trends are apparent and there is a clear path to free cash flow inflection in Q4 2022. If this scenario continues to play out into 2023, Holland ascertains that the current valuation is highly discounted. In Q3 2022, Whole Earth Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:FREE) generated a total revenue of $133.5 million, beating consensus by $2.85 million.Here is what Laughing Water Capital had to say about Whole Earth Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:FREE) in their Q2 2022 investor letter:“Whole Earth, our alternative sweeteners business, currently trades around 6-7x my estimate of normalized FCF, versus packaged food peers at more than 20x. To be fair, the company has somewhat painted themselves into a corner as they have been pitching themselves as an M&amp;A growth story, but after ~doubling revenue over the last 2 years, at present the balance sheet is full, and they do not have the equity cost of capital needed to continue to pursue M&amp;A with equity.Thus, the revenue growth story is on hold (although their category should grow faster than other packaged foods), which combined with some inflationary pressures has led to shares being punished. From my perspective, a stalled growth story is not great, but it is better than a continued growth story that is based on value destroying dilutive equity transactions: management deserves some credit for being disciplined. Further, debt paydown is a totally reasonable strategy to build equity value. The company is presently rebuilding the balance sheet, which at some point will likely be fire power for future M&amp;A.Putting the balance sheet aside, perhaps the most notable recent development is Martin Franklin bought ~14% of the equity during the quarter. No one is infallible, but at the very least it is curious to note that the last time Martin Franklin and FREE’s Chairman Irwin Simon worked together it was at Jarden Corporation, where Franklin compounded capital at 30% a year for 15 years before selling the business.Again, there is no guarantee here that history will rhyme, but a low starting valuation is a prerequisite for that sort of compounding, so we are starting from a good place. How cheap does a stock have to be to partner with people that have an incredible history of buying and building businesses? Should we wait for 4x or 5x normalized FCF? Or should we plow ahead at 6-7x and just acknowledge that the road forward will have plenty of speed bumps?”6. Brown-Forman Corp. (NYSE:BFB)Hedge Fund Holdings: 36Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Brown-Forman Corp. (NYSE:BFB) is an American company which specializes in the production and sale of spirits and wine.
