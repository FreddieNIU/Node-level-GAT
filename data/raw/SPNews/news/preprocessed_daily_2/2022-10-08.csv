And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) share price is up 70% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 37% (ignoring dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Texas Instruments will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 5 years was 94%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Texas Instruments returned a loss of 16% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 21%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Texas Instruments is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are potentially serious...For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Range Resources (RRC), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this independent oil and gas company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.78%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Range Resources was expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, but it reported $1.27 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.96%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.15 per share, while it actually produced $1.18 per share, a surprise of 2.61%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Range Resources. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Range Resources has an Earnings ESP of +9.35% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Unum Group's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Unum Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Unum Group is:11% = US$1.1b ÷ US$9.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Unum Group's Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Unum Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. Despite this, Unum Group's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Unum Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Unum Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Unum Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Unum Group's low three-year median payout ratio of 24%, (meaning the company retains76% of profits) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see higher growth than it has reported.Additionally, Unum Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 22% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 10%.SummaryOverall, we feel that Unum Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

9,e1b6caca-a06a-3e7b-9d9f-4e545c3a7c9b,USB,2022-10-08,Analysts Estimate U.S. Bancorp (USB) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-u-bancorp-usb-140002864.html,1665151202,STORY,['USB-PQ'],"[The market expects U.S. Bancorp (USB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 14, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.8%.Revenues are expected to be $6.26 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.84%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of +1.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.U.S. Bancorp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.8%. At the same time, the Dow lost 2.11%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.1%.Coming into today, shares of the fertilizer maker had gained 3.19% in the past month. In that same time, the Basic Materials sector gained 0.51%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.08%.Investors will be hoping for strength from CF Industries as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.53, up 267.71% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.42 billion, up 77.77% from the prior-year quarter.CF's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.31 per share and revenue of $11.75 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +355.42% and +79.64%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for CF Industries should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.72% higher within the past month. CF Industries currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, CF Industries currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.47. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 5.17, which means CF Industries is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that CF has a PEG ratio of 0.91. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

If you want to see more growth stocks in Dalio’s portfolio, click 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio, after a 47-year successful investment career, stepped down from his role as the co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates at the end of September, and he gave up his voting rights as well. However, he said that he would advise the present co-CIOs, Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, and the rest of the investment committee. As of the end of 2021, under Ray Dalio’s leadership, Bridgewater had returned $52.2 billion to clients since 1975, although returns in 2021 were just $5.7 billion on assets under management of $99.2 billion.For the last few years, Ray Dalio had been repeatedly saying that ""cash is trash"". However, he has now warmed up to the idea of holding US dollars and believes that it is an acceptable investment. In April 2020, he declared cash as basically worthless, given the near-zero interest rates and elevated money supply, which would lower the value of dollars. He tweeted on October 3: ""At existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutral – neither a very good or very bad deal. In other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.""Dalio predicts long-term interest rates of over 4.5%, which means rates might climb as per Dalio’s assumptions in the coming years. The $23.6 billion Bridgewater portfolio has a healthy mix of growth and value equities. Some of the best growth plays in Dalio’s fund include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Ray DalioOur Methodology We selected the following growth equities based on high price-to-earnings ratios, which exceeded 30 as of October 6.

The analyst is bullish on device utilization in a normalized environment and said ""the best thing that could come out of the 3Q season is an in-line delivery, 2022 reiterations, and a level setting for 2023.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 39 hedge funds were long Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 7.3 million shares worth $697 million. Like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) is one of the best growth stocks in Ray Dalio’s portfolio. Here is what Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund has to say about Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Innovation can foster growth in Health Care fields other than drug discovery. Edwards Lifesciences makes minimally invasive devices to treat heart disease or for critical care monitoring. Its transcatheter heart valve, SAPIEN, is the most-implanted aortic heart valve in the world. Having settled a lawsuit with Abbott over alleged patent infringement, Edwards is now moving ahead with a newer product line called PASCAL to treat elderly or frail patients—for whom currently available treatments are ineffective—for mitral and tricuspid disease. PASCAL is the fruit of the company’s ongoing investment in research and development. Between PASCAL and its next-generation SAPIEN valve, the company expects to double its addressable market to approximately US$20 billion by 2028.”11. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is headquartered in Newport Beach, California, operating a chain of Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Ray Dalio’s hedge fund owns 90,664 shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) as of Q2 2022, worth $118.5 million, representing 0.5% of the total securities. It is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. On October 4, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan raised the price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) to $1,708 from $1,503 and reiterated a Hold rating on the shares ahead of the Q3 results. The analyst believes investor expectations for Q3 same-store-sales results are in line with the present consensus estimate of 7.4%. He thinks Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) could meet a Q4 consensus same-store-sales estimate of up to 8.5%. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) at the end of June 2022, compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.10 million shares worth $1.4 billion. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings specifically said about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales, price increases to cover cost inflation, and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)10. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), a Chinese company operating an e-commerce platform, is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. The Bridgewater portfolio held 4.8 million shares of Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in Q2 2022, worth $297.5 million, representing 1.26% of the total securities. The stock has featured in Ray Dalio’s fund since Q2 2019. On September 2, Barclays analyst Jiong Shao raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $66 from $45 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The company posted ""surprisingly stronger than expected topline and gross margins"" in Q2, the analyst told investors. However, ""limited disclosures"" were offered as usual, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 36 funds in the last quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 6.15 million shares worth about $381 million. Here is what Tao Value has to say about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue to grow with such a team with a strong culture.”9. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) is a New Jersey-based company that develops, manufactures, and sells medical supplies, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic products for healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, and pharmaceutical markets worldwide. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) is one of the best growth stocks in Ray Dalio’s Q2 portfolio, with the billionaire holding a $110.3 million position in the company. On October 4, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar added Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) to the firm's ""TAP Outperform"" list ahead of Q3 earnings of the group. His earnings previews are influenced by the ""interesting"" results from Evercore’s three different surveys on Hospital CapEx/Procedures, lab activity, and U.S. TAVR trends, the analyst noted. He has an Outperform rating and a $275 price target on Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) shares.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were long Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 49 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $789.4 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Becton, Dickinson, and Company (NYSE:BDX) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like medical equipment (medical device and laboratory supplier Becton Dickinson). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Pleasanton, California. The company provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 497,587 shares of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) as of the second quarter of 2022, worth $98.5 million. Dalio boosted his stake by 29% in Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in Q2 and it is one of the best growth stocks in his portfolio. On September 15, KeyBanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus assumed coverage of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) with an Overweight rating and a $220 price target. The analyst is positive on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)’s ability to successfully address new services with its R&amp;D/Vault platform. The analyst added that he sees Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) as well positioned to boost its top line at 15% over the next few years at stable 40% EBIT margins, which are some of the highest in all HCIT and SaaS universes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), with 757,605  shares worth $150 million. Overall, 45 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of June 2022, up from 41 funds in the prior quarter. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is a ​​New York-based manufacturer and marketer of skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products worldwide. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 612,560 shares of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) as of June 2022, worth $156 million and representing 0.66% of the 13F portfolio. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. On September 20, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $303, up from $298. China's zero-Covid policy still impacts the company's business, but after the derating in the stock, these headwinds are now ""adequately reflected"" in the valuation, the analyst told investors. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the leading position holder in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), with approximately 6 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Overall, 46 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of June 2022. Here is what Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund has to say about The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold cosmetic producer Estée Lauder, which we bought last March. At the time, the market reflected a dire outlook for retail demand, especially tourist-related; however, we found its Chinese business attractive and admired its agility across social media and other digital channels. As the stock has appreciated, the resulting valuation now leaves no room for error, such as a potential shift of Chinese consumers’ tastes away from US brands.”6. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a Michigan-based medical technology company, operating through two segments – MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine.

Ray Dalio owns 629,041 shares of Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) as of Q2 2022, worth over $125 million and representing 0.53% of the total 13F portfolio. On October 5, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch maintained a Buy recommendation on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) but lowered the price target on the shares to $246 from $255, noting that hospital staffing remains a headwind but it is at least stable, and there are pockets of improved pricing. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 46 hedge funds were long Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), compared to 41 funds in the last quarter. Arrowstreet Capital is the leading stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 million shares worth $206 million. In addition to PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is one of the best growth stocks in the Bridgewater portfolio. Here is what Nelson Capital Management has to say about Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“We bought a position in Stryker (tkr: SYK), a medical device company that acts as a one-stop shop for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.

A bullish long-term growth strategy buoys optimism on the stock. Yet, stiff competition in Edwards Lifesciences’ TAVR business continues to hurt the company. Persistent forex woes also remain an overhang. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 26.8% compared with the 33.7% fall of the industry.Edwards Lifesciences’ first-quarter 2022 earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company registered strong year-over-year sales growth across TAVR and TMTT product groups, instilling optimism. The strong adoption of the company’s newly-launched MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve across the United States looks encouraging. The continued strength of the HemoSphere monitoring platform is impressive too. The expansion of margins seems promising. Strong growth prospects in emerging economies and strong solvency and capital structure are added benefits.Critical Care sales were up 2.7% on an underlying basis in the second quarter of 2022. The revenue uptick resulted from the increased uptake of the company's Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) algorithm and broad portfolio of sensors. Further, the company continued enrollment in the HPI Smart BP trial that focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support further adoption. The company also continued to see robust demand for the HemoSphere monitoring platform with a healthy pipeline.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteEdwards Lifesciences expects full-year 2022 underlying sales growth in the mid-single-digit range on the back of strength in demand for products used in more intense surgeries.In the second quarter, Edwards Lifesciences’ Surgical Structural Heart sales improved 1.6% on an underlying basis, banking on increased penetration of premium RESILIA products. The company delivered impressive global growth amid headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain non-core cannula products and the COVID-related shutdown in China.In March 2022, the company got FDA approval and subsequent commercial launch of the MITRIS RESILIA valve, which adds to the portfolio of durable RESILIA tissue products with a valve designed for the heart's mitral position. The MITRIS valve builds on the commercial success of the INSPIRIS aortic valve while providing intuitive product features as well as the benefits of the innovative RESILIA tissue technology.Story continuesSo far, the physician feedback for MITRIS has been positive and initial clinical outcomes have been favorable. In the second quarter, the company continued to expand the overall body evidence that supports Edwards RESILIA tissue valves. In May 2022, the company presented results from a commenced trial sub-analysis at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons, which demonstrated the excellent performance of this tissue technology in treating bicuspid aortic valve disease.Edwards Lifesciences expects underlying sales growth for 2022 in the mid-single-digit range, driven by market growth and the adoption of premium technologies.On the flip side, Edwards Lifesciences’ revenues for the second quarter missed the consensus mark. U.S. TAVR sales were impacted by a slower-than-expected improvement in hospital staffing and temporary contrast agent shortages. The company’s research and development expenditures were up 11.3% year over year. This increase was driven by continued investments in the company's transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9.2% year over year, driven by the resumption of in-person commercial activities. These developments drove operating costs by 10%, building pressure on the company’s bottom line.The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and COVID-related hospital staffing issues are concerning. The company has lowered its sales outlook for full-year 2022, taking these macroeconomic challenges into account.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Abiomed ABMD.

Our commitment was also meant to serve as a loud call to action for all our stakeholders-as collaboration, behavior change, innovation and a shared vision are all essential to achieving this transformative shift.Two years in, we're asking: What does regeneration look like? How does it shape the way we respond to a changing climate, nature loss, the colossal issue of waste or the challenge of ensuring people in supply chains can work with dignity? And what role can strategic philanthropy play in driving systems change?At Walmart, regeneration means having a lasting, net-positive impact on people and the planet through our products, services and business practices. We aim to do this by renewing, restoring and replenishing our social and environmental systems, pursuing more sustainable practices, strengthening communities, generating economic opportunity and conducting ourselves with ethics and integrity. As a critical part of this journey, our sustainability efforts are designed to drive regenerative practices in agriculture, forest and fisheries management; eliminate waste along the product supply chain; decarbonize our operations and promote the dignity of people in our supply chain.""Our job is to design everything that we do in a way that the path of least resistance is the more sustainable or regenerative approach.""Doug McMillon, President and CEO, Walmart Inc.This week at our annual Sustainability Milestone Summit we celebrated almost 20 years since we embarked on our sustainability journey and two years since our commitment to pursue regeneration - here is a glimpse into where we are today.Zero emissions energy and transportationThrough innovations in energy and transportation, we're striving to power 100% of our global operations with renewable sources of energy by 2035 and achieve our overall goal of zero emissions across global operations by 2040. Here are a few examples of our progress:Story continuesIn July of 2022, Walmart made a commitment to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles from Canoo for delivering online orders with zero emissions.In 2021, an estimated 46% of Walmart's global electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources.1Nature-based solutionsFrom tuna to rice we are using place-based nature solutions to protect, restore and more sustainably manage landscapes and seascapes.In collaboration with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI), Walmart's Great Value tuna is now sourced from Pacific Island Tuna, with much of the profits returned to local communities for social and environmental initiatives.One million acres in the Northern Great Plains are being protected through an improved soil health initiative in collaboration with Northern Great Plains cattle ranchers, WWF and the Walmart Foundation.Since 2020, 16 ranches have joined.150,000+ acres have enrolled in sustainable management.Avoiding at least an estimated 3.24 metric tons of emissions.Breaking the link between consumption and wasteCreating a circular economy requires redesigning a system that breaks the link between consumption and waste.We're on the road to building a circular economy, striving to achieve zero operational waste by 2025. Globally, we diverted 78% of operational waste from landfills and incineration in 2021.Walmart launched the Circular Connector as a first-of-its-kind platform to match circular packaging solutions with the manufacturers that need them the most-as of Sept. 30, 2022, we had already received 165 submissions.With a grant from Walmart Foundation, nonprofit Delterra will make Plastic IQ, a powerful tool used to measure a product's dependence on plastic, available now to companies in Central America as well.Advancing supplier sustainability &amp; diversityWe're expanding our supplier base by creating economic opportunities for diverse suppliers and smallholder farmers.Through Project Gigaton™-Walmart's initiative to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emission from the global value chain by 2030-we are engaging over 4,500 suppliers on taking measurable action across climate, nature and waste. This year, we crossed the halfway mark toward our goal with suppliers reporting more than 574 million metric tons of emissions reduced or avoided globally.Since 2017, the Walmart Foundation has granted more than $67 million to benefit smallholder producers in Central America, India and Mexico:730,000 smallholder farmers supported so far.More than 44% of farmers are women.Partners in regenerationAs we continue to advance these efforts, we're keeping our focus firmly on accelerating progress, in collaboration with our associates, customers, suppliers, producers and NGO leaders. We recognize the gravity of the decade we are in and the work is far from done -while some of this work is operational, much of it will depend on changing habits built over generations and will require each of us to come together. Together, we will continue raising our ambition, clarifying our roadmaps, piloting solutions and keeping our foot on the pedal.Join us - and let's make this decade of action count.1. The percentage of energy that is estimated to come from renewable sources considers energy generated by active renewable and low-carbon projects. It considers the combined contribution of power generated from on-site and off-site projects as well as renewable energy generation feeding into the grids where Walmart facilities are located. The estimate does not include energy data for our Flipkart business, which is expected to have a negligible impact on the percentage reported.Walmart, Friday, October 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walmart on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: WalmartWebsite: http://corporate.walmart.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: WalmartView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719485/Accelerating-Regeneration-for-a-Decade-of-Action]"

As of October 5, the S&amp;P 500 has tanked over 21% year to date, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 30% for the year, and the Dow has lost 17.35% since the beginning of 2022. The stock market is in shambles, but for long-term investors, it has started to look like an attractive entry point.Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: “If You’re a Long-Term Investor, I Would Absolutely Buy Now”Jeremy Siegel is a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and is a notable commentator on the economy and capital markets. Mr. Siegel recently appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ where he discussed his view on why now is an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors. Here are some comments from the professor of finance at one of the top business schools in the world:“If you’re a long-term investor, I would absolutely buy now. I think these are absolutely great long-term values. Could it go down more? Of course in the short-run and in bear markets (historical), it has gone down more. But when you’re talking about 16 times earnings and even if they are clipped by a recession, you shouldn’t just base it on recession earnings you should base it on longer-term earnings, which I think are very favorable looking beyond the dip. I think these are just absolutely excellent values. Short-term, anything can happen in the short term.”While short-term investors are unwinding their positions and triggering major sell-offs, they are in fact creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces.

(WMT) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-walmart-inc-130001819.html,1665147601,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has lost 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, indicating a change of -9.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 points to a change of -9.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.52 indicates a change of +11.6% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Walmart, the consensus sales estimate of $147.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $600.2 billion and $618.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.4%. EPS of $1.77 for the same period compares with $1.78 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +10.63%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

20,e7358921-fe54-3ee3-9cc8-0a0ecf927bdb,EQR,2022-10-08,5 Reasons to Buy Mid-America Apartment (MAA) Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-buy-mid-america-141502202.html,1665152102,STORY,"['MAA-PI', 'EQR', 'BRT']","[Headquartered in Germantown, TN, Mid-America Apartment Communities MAA — commonly known as MAA — is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) residential REIT have declined 12.7% over the past month, narrower than the industry’s fall of 12.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMAA is experiencing a favorable estimate revision trend. Estimates for the third quarter and current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share have moved north marginally over the past two months. Projected FFO per share growth rates for the third quarter and 2022 are 17.4% and 18.1%, respectively.Factors That Make Mid-America Apartment a Solid PickSunbelt-Focused Portfolio: MAA’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. Encouragingly, MAA’s portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown.The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets, as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable trends are increasing the desirability of its markets and boosting demand for rental units. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenue growth.Expansion Efforts: This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $175 to $225 million and acquisitions of $75 to 125 million for 2022. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.Amid a competitive pricing environment for acquisitions and the growing demand for apartment housing across its Sunbelt markets, the company’s focus on its development pipeline is a strategic fit.Redevelopment &amp; Technology Initiatives: MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations.The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base. Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.Balance Sheet Strength: MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. It generated 95.1% unencumbered NOI in the second quarter of 2022, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 22.97% growth expected for the industry. In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity is 10.01% compared with the industry’s average of 5.52%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.  Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In May 2022, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.25 per share, marking a 15% hike over the prior payment.Moreover, in December 2021, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.0875 per share. This marked a 6.1% sequential hike and the 12th consecutive annual increase in the company’s dividend.

The majority of the world’s water is full of salt, frozen within snow or glaciers, or is contaminated or otherwise not fit for human consumption.The industry to convert water into a product fit for human consumption is quite a large one, and there are a lot of different ways to get exposure to the sector. These include but are not limited to industrial plays, water utilities and firms focus on efficiency.There are good arguments for getting exposure to water stocks across the industry. These seven water stocks give investors a variety of ways to benefit as we spend more money securing this most precious resource.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPNRPentair$42.40XYLXylem$105.54VMIValmont Industries$321.07ECLEcolab$142.98AWKAmerican Water Works$141.84WTRGEssential Utilities $44.14GWRSGlobal Water Resources$12.46Pentair (PNR)Several new gray valves, for water or gas, lie on the floor at the factory. The valves are gray for water or gas at the factory of the manufacturerSource: Dmitrii Pridannikov / Shutterstock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) is a worldwide leader in water filtration, with operations in more than dozen countries. The firm offers industrial filtering, pumps, and flow solutions. it also has a swimming pool business, where it makes pool equipment and filters.The swimming pool business positively blasted off in popularity during the pandemic as people sought new ways to have fun and exercise at home. Understandably, investors are now concerned that swimming pool installations will plunge after 2021’s record run. That probably will happen.However, investors shouldn’t write off Pentair as simply a cyclical play on leisure dollars. The industrial business is a powerful one and is far less impacted by economic cycles. The need for clean water isn’t going anywhere, and Pentair will enjoy rising long-term demand in that market regardless of near-term swings in the pool business.PNR stock has dropped by more than 40% over the past year, pushing shares down to just 12 times forward earnings and making it one of the more affordable water stocks to buy.Story continuesXylem (XYL)xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) is a major player in the water infrastructure space. Instead of serving one niche, Xylem has built out a broad platform, aiming to be a one-stop shop for water equipment needs.Xylem supplies water measurement, infrastructure, storage, testing, and efficiency equipment among other goods.The basic idea is that a customer such as a water utility can buy everything it needs from Xylem instead of having to go a variety of different vendors for each product. This creates efficiencies of scale with sales and marketing.XYL stock tends to always be expensive, and that remains the case today. Shares were down more than 25% for the year at one point but have rebounded in recent weeks.That rally has picked up steam as the company’s recently announced Q3 earnings easily topped expectations and the company boosted guidance significantly.Unfortunately, shares are now going for more than 35 times forward earnings. However, if you want the leading water infrastructure company, Xylem is one of the best water stocks to own, and its past track record has been strong enough to justify paying a premium valuation for shares.Valmont Industries (VMI)Environmental technology concept. Picture of mountains with icons of infrastructure on top of it. Infrastructure stocks.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockValmont Industries (NYSE:VMI) is a little-known industrial conglomerate. Shares have produced a more than 3,000% gain over the past 30 years, with shares rising from $9 in 1992 to more than $320 today. Often niche players such as Valmont are able to put up surprisingly robust and long-lived outperformance.What has powered Valmont’s tremendous performance? It owns a variety of businesses. One primary one is in making fabricated poles for uses such as traffic, lighting, and cell phone towers. Another key division relates to water; Valmont makes a good deal of mechanical irrigation equipment and related water management solutions and technology.This is a key area of interest given geopolitical developments over the past year. Ukraine and Russia are both major grain producers, and it seems likely the ongoing war will greatly impact harvests from that region.As a result, the world needs to maximize its grain production from other leading agricultural zones. Valmont should see healthy demand for irrigation systems as a result.Ecolab (ECL)Ecolab (ECL) logo on its corporate headquarters building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comEcolab (NYSE:ECL) is the world’s largest provider of sanitation, hygiene and water treatment services globally. The company generated almost five times as much revenue as its closest rival, Diversey (NASDAQ:DSEY), last year.The company’s appeal is simple. A large consumer firm such as a fast food chain, cruise ship operator, or multinational hotel group takes out an all-in-one contract with Ecolab. Ecolab can provide that client with pest control, surface cleaning, specialty chemicals, and water treatment and efficiency.By contrast, that same restaurant or hotel would have to hire a bunch of different companies to provide those tasks on an individual basis. Ecolab’s focus on delivering water-saving solutions to customers has been particularly attractive as clients focus on reducing their ecological footprints while saving money.Ecolab’s business is heavily exposed to consumer discretionary spending. Thus, the pandemic crushed the business as many restaurants, hotels, airports and so on temporarily shut down. Now, however, as the world economy has reopened, business has come roaring back.Earnings are back up as the company has reported double-digit revenue growth again. That said, ECL stock is still far below its highs as investors worry about inflation and supply chain pressures on the company’s margins.Given Ecolab’s dominant market position, however, its only a matter of time until Ecolab shares return to their pre-pandemic levels.American Water Works (AWK)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockThere are a fairly large number of publicly traded American power utilities. For whatever reason, however, water utilities are much more likely to be held privately or by local governments.As a result, there are fewer than a dozen sizable publicly-traded water utility stocks in the United States today. Of these, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is among the largest. It provides water and wastewater services to more than 1,700 towns and municipalities across 14 states.Generally, water utilities, including AWK stock, have been rather expensive. American Water Works shares have traded as high as 40 times earnings at some points.With the current bear market, things have gotten a bit more reasonable. AWK stock is down more than 20% year-to-date, pushing the forward P/E ratio to 32. That might still seem expensive.However, it’s actually not bad for a company as consistent as American Water Works. Year in and year out, the company has higher revenues, higher profits, and raises its dividend. That consistency is worth a lot, especially in uncertain times such as the present.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Miniature house and symbols of public utilities.Source: Andrii Yalanskyi / ShutterstockEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is another large water utility. Until 2020, it was Aqua America and was a pureplay water operation. At that time, however, it bought People’s Gas which diversified the business. Regardless the gas unit is smaller than the prior Aqua America operations.The combined firm offers investors the promise of tremendous stability. Essential Utilities is a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning that it has increased its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. The company’s focus on regulated utilities means cash flows are steady, which enable such a predictable and increasing dividend stream.The company has also found some growth opportunities in modernizing older water infrastructure. Given the water quality crises we’ve seen in cities such as Flint, there is increasing government focus on improving older infrastructure. Essential can play a role in updating these vital pipe and treatment facility networks while earnings a regulated return on capital for doing so.Global Water Resources (GWRS)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comDon’t let the name fool you, Global Water Resources (NASDAQ:GWRS) is a smaller utility that has a laser focus on just one state, Arizona. It is based out of a Phoenix suburb.Over the years, it has accumulated a wide service area in numerous towns and suburbs in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas.Arizona is a unique market in that its growth patterns encouraged the development of hundreds of tiny water utilities, each of which often service an area as small as one subdivision or small town. Recent regulatory changes have made it harder for small Arizona utilities to remain independent, thus causing a wave of consolidation. Global Water has acquired more than half a dozen other Arizona water utilities in recent years.This makes GWRS a strong growth stock within the typically staid utility industry. And Arizona itself is booming. Thanks to immigration and retirees moving to Phoenix for warm weather, Arizona has been one of the fastest-growing states in the country.More people means more water usage, and, in turn, more profitability for Global Water. In the meantime, the company also rewards shareholders with a monthly dividend which gives investors steady reliable income.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ECL, WTRG, and GWRS stock.

And since the pandemic and getting back out in the world, many travelers have shown with their dollars that they are willing to splurge.Norwegian Cruise Line upped its game among luxury cruise competitors with The Haven, which doesn't consist of just better staterooms, but a fully upgraded end-to-end experience from boarding to disembarking.Norwegian Cruise Line. Norwegian Prima ship. Aerial view of sailing.Guests in The Haven can cherish their exclusivity before even getting to their suites, which are sealed off from other staterooms on the desk with an electronically locked door that opens with a key card. Behind those doors, the hallways are lined with dark wooden panels and mood lighting reminiscent of an urban luxury hotel—and that's by design.NCL president and chief executive officer Harry Sommer recalled when NCL went to the designers, the company wanted a cruise ship doesn't ""depreciate,"" one that resembles ""a high-end, beautiful hotel, or even a residential type of area.""Norwegian Cruise Line The Haven guest stateroom""We use a lot of different architects to design the space, and they all have different visions, and then you try to do your best to make sure that when you're leaving one room that an architect designed, and then go into the next room that a different architect designed that there's some continuity that doesn't feel like you're in two different places,"" Sommer explained during a media briefing in New York City earlier this month. ""So I think there's there's a couple of rooms where we do a better job with those transitions.""Norwegian Cruise Line The Haven guest stateroomCompleted this year, NCL's newest ship, the Prima, measures 965 feet (294 meters) from aft to forward, hosting over 3,100 guests at double occupancy with more than 1,500 crew members. The first of a new class of six ships from NCL set to roll out from 2022 to 2027, NCL touts the Prima as pushing the boundaries on cruise design, service, and sustainability.NCL assembled a consortium of prominent design firms for the Prima class, including Piero Lissoni, Rockwell Group, SMC Design, and Studio Dado. The cruise operator also invested more than $6 million on art, with pieces from more than 50 world-renowned artists, which are curated and spread throughout the ship in various lounges, hallways, and even an outdoor sculpture garden.Story continuesNorwegian Cruise Line The Haven guest stateroomStaterooms in The Haven are considerably larger, with dedicated living and bar areas, separated bedrooms, bathrooms large enough to fit a tub, at least double the amount of deck space. Guests have dedicated concierges for accessing anything they might need as well as assistance with making reservations at one of the specialty restaurants, shore excursions, or one of the ship's entertainment programs, such as an off-Broadway musical or an improv comedy show.Norwegian Cruise Line The Haven loungeThe Haven is also especially appealing for digital nomads—and that's not just for the extra living space in the rooms (as well as Wi-Fi throughout the ship). Guests in The Haven have access to a special lounge, with its own bar and restaurant, but also plenty of couches and quiet space to get work done. The Haven lounge also has its own private sun deck at the aft of the ship with an infinity pool.Sommer also told reporters that The Haven has opened up NCL to more ""multi-generational travel.""""I think it appeals to a slightly different demographic, a slightly more affluent demographic, and to some extent, a slightly older demographic,"" Sommer said, describing how customers in these suites will often want to bring their children and grandchildren, but are hard-pressed to find a suitable experience that offers both a family-friendly time with an upscale brand. ""So here you get the best of both worlds, where the more affluent get the concierge, key card access, a private restaurant, their own pool, but their children and grandchildren"" can visit the water slides and the three-story race track.The Haven accounts more than 100 of the 1,600 cabins, around 6% of occupancy, and Sommer estimated that The Haven accounts for at least 3% of the cabins across its fleet so far.Sustainable cocktails at seaSustainability is no longer just a metric or a goal for the likes of small, science-focused expedition cruises anymore. Cruise operators—large or small, budget or luxury—have gotten onboard with remodeling their ships or building them from the sea up to be more friendly to the environment and the natural ecosystems of their destinations.Norwegian Cruise Line. Norwegian Prima. Metropolitan BarOf course, when you're on a cruise, there's some fun to be had, and there can be fun while promoting sustainability, too.Case in point, NCL boasts that the Prima will host the first sustainable cocktail bar at sea. The Metropolitan Bar is a concept space that uses food scraps to make its own liqueurs and syrups to go into specialty cocktails. The drinks menu includes the ""Primadonna,"" which looks like an Old Fashioned but is made with Flor de Caña ECO rum, homemade banana peel syrup, walnut bitters, and orange peel; and the Sustainable Spritz, which resembles an Aperol Spritz but is made with rosemary stem-infused vodka, surplus champagne, soda water, and half an orange wheel.The cocktail bar falls within NCL's larger, company-wide ESG strategy, Sail and Sustain, which is centered around reducing environmental impact (minimizing waste, conserving fresh water, protecting oceans, etc.), investing in local communities and providing disaster relief (especially areas affected more by climate change-induced disasters), protecting personal data and privacy, empowering and supporting employee well-being.Norwegian Cruise Line. Norwegian Prima ship. Onda by Scarpetta restaurant.Among some of the ship's most notable sustainability features: The onboard food digesters use air, water, and microbiology to safely turn food waste into liquid, reducing overall food waste. And for onboard water production, evaporators and reverse osmosis plants use seawater as the source, reducing the need for the bunkering of fresh water. The ballast water treatment system was designed to ensure no invasive species are inadvertently introduced into new waters.All in all, NCL has a goal to have zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which Sommer acknowledged is an ""an aggressive path forward.""""But we absolutely plan to keep to that and work towards it,"" Sommer said. He identified two ""promising"" areas that NCL is looking at to make this happen. First is biodiesel fuel, which NCL is already testing on some ships within its fleet now, and is already compatible with fuel tanks and engines onboard. Biodiesel is more widely available in Europe, although, as Sommer noted, it's mostly used by trucking companies.Norwegian Cruise Line. Norwegian Prima ship. Ocean Boulevard outer deck.The second area is methanol; Sommer said NCL is looking to do tests on select ships but also looking forward into building ships with methanol support from day one rather than have to convert existing engineering later. Sommer added NCL has been looking into hydrogen fuel, but there's not enough of a readily green supply available. He said he expects more progress on this front in the later half of the decade going into the 2030s.""We can be on track to do that,"" Sommer said, ""with the technology that's either exists today or seems to be on the cusp of being available on a commercial basis for cruise ships.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com.]"

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) stock is up an impressive 143% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 24% over the last quarter.Since it's been a strong week for Gartner shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Gartner While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Gartner achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 80% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 19% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Gartner shares lost 1.5% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 19%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Gartner better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Gartner (1 can't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.Story continuesGartner is not the only stock insiders are buying.

This company, which is in the Zacks Consulting Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This technology information and analysis company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 28.23%.For the most recent quarter, Gartner was expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share, but it reported $2.85 per share instead, representing a surprise of 33.18%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.89 per share, while it actually produced $2.33 per share, a surprise of 23.28%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Gartner. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Gartner currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Will the OPEC cut in oil production make it worse?,USA TODAY,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a17b9a45-927e-3b03-bda6-a5df40e71eb4/gas-prices-differ-from-state.html,1665226862,STORY,['CL=F'],"[As major oil-producing countries plan to slash production, U.S. gas prices may rise again, with some states potentially feeling the brunt more than others.The OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing countries announced Wednesday it will cut production by 2 million barrels per day starting in November, a move that may put further upward pressure on U.S. gasoline prices.“Will American drivers see an immediate impact?” AAA spokesman Andrew Gross said, noting that oil makes up about 60% of what drivers pay for at the pump. “That's really hard to say...There are much more immediate reasons why the price of gasoline has been going up.”Even before the group’s decision, gas prices had started ticking up across the nation after briefly declining.  The national average gas price stood at $3.89 as of Friday, according to AAA, up from $3.79 the week before.Why are gas prices going up?: More pain at the pump as OPEC cuts oil production by 2 million barrelsWhy do gas prices differ between states?Regional differences in gas prices have been stark mainly because of refinery issues, with prices in California currently  hovering around $6 a gallon while Texas and Gulf Coast prices are just over $3.On the West Coast, maintenance that temporarily shuttered at least six refineries limited supplies, increasing pump prices, Gross said. The refineries, however, are coming back online and California officials allowed less expensive winter-blend gasoline to be sold a month in advance, bringing drivers relief. California pump prices dropped Friday to $6.39. The upper Midwest, meanwhile, saw gas prices spike after a deadly explosion and fire at a refinery in Toledo, Ohio.“While the West Coast might see some price easing, it’s going to be a little while in the upper Midwest,” Gross said.Overall, gas prices vary across state lines due to proximity to oil refineries and pipelines, and issues at the plants, and state taxes. “When supply is adequate in every region and when there are no refinery issues, really the only difference you see between states and regions is the difference in gasoline taxes,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a company that tracks oil and gas markets.Story continuesWhy are gas prices higher in California than Kansas?: Gas experts break down costs from state to stateSave at the pump: How to save money as gas prices hit all-time high with Russian invasion of UkraineWhat does the OPEC+ decision mean for US drivers?Prices at the pump may go up on the East Coast, as well as in the South, Northeast and the Rockies because of the OPEC+ decision, said De Haan.The West Coast, Great Lakes and Plains, meanwhile, could see prices drop as refinery issues in the area improve. But with OPEC+ cutting production, prices may not go down as much as they could have otherwise, De Haan said.“Everyone's gonna feel the impact to the tune of 10 to 30 cents, ” De Haan said.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is headquartered in Vienna.Why is OPEC+ cutting production?OPEC+ said the move was based on the “uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks,” the Associated Press reported.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the group is adjusting supply ahead of a possible dip in demand, according to AP.The OPEC+ decision, De Haan said, could put the global economy in a “very precarious place because there is very little margin for error.”“I think there's more oil production needed,” De Haan said. “OPEC is doing this cut at a very inopportune time – global oil inventories remain very tight.”President Joe Biden called the move “disappointing,” and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president considered the decision “short-sighted” as the global economy still reels from the impact of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, AP reported.What has Biden done to try to rein in gas prices?After OPEC+’s announcement, Biden said Thursday his administration is looking at “alternatives” to lower gas prices.Biden in March ordered the release of 1 million barrels of crude oil a day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months and told oil producers to immediately cut costs for Americans. “There's not a lot any administration can do – Republican or Democrat – when oil prices started to go up because oil is a global commodity,” Gross said. “We don't set the price here in this country, nor do we set the price for gasoline.”Contributing: Associated Press This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Why are gas prices higher in California than in Texas?]"

The SPR — the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil — was established back in 1975 in case of a severe oil supply crisis or economic disruption.Biden’s decision comes after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) said it would slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day — putting extra pressure on the global energy supply.However, with the country’s emergency reserve already at its lowest levels since 1984, some experts have concerns about the long-term implications.Don’t missInvest your spare change and turn your pennies into a productive portfolioA TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by cash stuffingYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and KrogerU.S. gas prices are going up againGas prices hit a record high of $5.02 a gallon in June after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but this summer saw a 99-day streak of lower prices due to recession fears and declining oil prices.However, even before OPEC+ declared it would be cutting back on oil production, gas prices began inching back up again in late September. This may have been due to a combination of increasing demand, refinery issues and the upcoming European ban on Russian oil.Now with OPEC+’s recent decision, prices are expected to escalate even further. The group says the production cuts are being made due to “the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.”As of Oct. 7, the average national gas price was $3.89 per gallon, which is about 10 cents higher than the week before, according to AAA.Biden disappointed by 'shortsighted' production cutHours after the OPEC+ announcement, the White House said the president was disappointed by “the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas” as the global economy is still contending with the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesThe press release noted that 10 million barrels of oil would be drained from the SPR and the Secretary of Energy would be exploring other options to increase domestic production.Read more: Do you fall in America's lower, middle, or upper class? How your income stacks upBiden also urged gas companies to keep bringing gas prices down.Why making big withdrawals from the reserve could be riskySince March, the Energy Department has released 160 million barrels of crude oil, or over a quarter of the stockpile — draining the SPR to its lowest levels in four decades.As of Sept. 30, the reserve has dropped to 416 million barrels, according to department data.The Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) stated back in Nov. 2021 that it strongly opposed tapping into oil stockpiles to counter gas prices. The group’s concern was that depleting the emergency reserve could put the U.S. at risk if the global or domestic oil supply reaches dangerously low levels before the supply can be brought back up.The IPAA recommends ramping up domestic natural gas and oil production instead, although oil producers are already dealing with supply-chain issues, limited capital and investor pressure to boost returns.Francisco Blanch, managing director and head of global commodities at Bank of America Global Research also voiced criticism in a segment on Bloomberg Television.“I don’t think it’s a great idea given the incredibly tense geopolitical world we live in today,” Blanch said. By using up the reserve, the U.S. could be putting itself “more in the hands of OPEC+ … eventually you’re just ceding more and more market control.”What to read next'I just can't wait to get out': Nearly three-quarters of pandemic homebuyers have regrets — here's what you need to know before you put in that offer'Remarkable reversal': President Biden just (quietly) scaled back student loan forgiveness — and the change could impact up to 1.5M borrowers.

And price is headed in that direction, as you can see. WTI at more than 5%. Brent up more than 4%. And both up more than 10% for the week.Take a look at what this means for drivers.

Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, let's get you up to speed now on jobs. We saw that September's unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%. Non-farm payrolls were up by 263,000, led by gains in leisure and hospitality. But that's also the lowest monthly increase since April of 2021. Wages edged up 0.3%, marking a 5% increase from a year ago.But also taking a look at labor force participation. That ticked lower to 62.3%. And the size of the labor market also shrank by 57,000.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.5%.Revenues are expected to be $13.2 billion, down 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Morgan Stanley?For Morgan Stanley, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Morgan Stanley will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Morgan Stanley would post earnings of $1.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.44, delivering a surprise of -7.10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Morgan Stanley appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.8%. At the same time, the Dow lost 2.11%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.1%.Coming into today, shares of the energy company had gained 10.31% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector gained 1.49%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.08%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Marathon Oil as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 2, 2022. On that day, Marathon Oil is projected to report earnings of $1.23 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 215.38%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.13 billion, up 46.51% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.75 per share and revenue of $8.29 billion, which would represent changes of +202.55% and +51.61%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 2.69% lower. Marathon Oil is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Marathon Oil currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.94. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.61, so we one might conclude that Marathon Oil is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that MRO currently has a PEG ratio of 0.41. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.42 as of yesterday's close.The Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 172, putting it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

Investors seemingly can't catch a break, whether that be a hawkish Fed, geopolitical issues, or lingering COVID-19 effects spoiling the fun.However, when taking a step back, several notable announcements seem to have been forgotten amidst all the negativity.And they’re not small announcements by any means, either.We’re talking about significant acquisition news from large-cap tech companies.Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Broadcom AVGO have all announced major acquisitions in 2022, indicating that they are still laser-focused on growth opportunities.Let’s take a deeper dive into each acquisition a little further.Broadcom To Acquire VMwareBroadcom announced its plans to acquire VMware VMW in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $61 billion in May, expected to close in Broadcom’s FY23.VMware is a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all apps, having pioneered virtualization technology, an innovation that has positively transformed x86 server-based computing.The combined company will offer enterprise customers a broader platform of critical infrastructure solutions to help them accelerate innovation and address the most complex information technology infrastructure requirements.It’s been a challenging road for AVGO shares in 2022, down nearly 30%.However, the company’s dividend metrics are too hard to ignore; AVGO’s annual dividend yield sits at a steep 3.4%, visibly higher than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 0.9%.Further, the company carries a massive 26.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, Broadcom shares are cheap for a technology company – the company sports a 13.9X forward earnings multiple, well below its 16.6X five-year median and reflecting a sizable 34% discount relative to its Zacks sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesMicrosoft To Acquire ActivisionMicrosoft made a big splash earlier this year, putting forward its plans to acquire Activision Blizzard ATVI for a whopping $68.7 billion - the largest acquisition in the video game industry’s history.Activision Blizzard is a video game development and interactive entertainment content publisher best known for its Call of Duty franchise. The reasons behind the deal are clear – Microsoft wants to bolster its stance in the video game industry.MSFT shares have been no exception to the market’s woes in 2022, down 30%.However, the company is still forecasted to grow at a solid pace; earnings are forecasted to climb 9.2% in FY23 and a further double-digit 16% in FY24.Pivoting to the top line, estimates suggest revenue growth of 11% and 13.4% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabet Acquires Mandiant In March of this year, Alphabet told its plans to acquire Mandiant for a price tag of $5.4 billion. The deal was completed in September. Mandiant is a dynamic provider of cyber defense and response solutions, utilizing its cloud-based Mandiant Advantage software as a service (SaaS) platform.It’s a clear attempt from Alphabet to capitalize on the rapidly growing cloud computing market, with Mandiant joining forces with Google Cloud.The adverse price action in 2022 has caused GOOGL’s forward earnings multiple to slide down to 19.5X, nowhere near its five-year median of an expensive 26.8X.Further, the value reflects a respectable 8% discount relative to its Zacks sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabet generates serious cash – in its latest print, the company reported quarterly free cash flow of $12.6 billion, the fourth highest of any S&amp;P 500 company in Q2 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile negative sentiment has been widespread all year, there are still many positive announcements we’ve received from companies, including acquisitions from the three titans above.Acquisitions allow for a vast range of growth opportunities and for companies to get their hands on impressive talent.Further, acquisitions speak volumes about a company’s future roadmap, telling us that it's willing to pursue long-term growth opportunities.All three companies above – Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Broadcom AVGO – have all taken on notable acquisitions in 2022.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more of the most valuable companies in history, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Companies In History.Many of the most valuable companies in history dominate their industries. Some of the most valuable companies in history dominated oil and gas. Some are leaders in information technology and computing. All of the companies created a lot of value for their shareholders.In terms of what creates the most valuable companies in history, the size of the country's economy that a company is from is a key component. If a company's parent country is a small country, it is harder for that company to reach the scale needed to be considered among the most valuable in history. If the company's parent country is a nation with a huge economy, on the other hand, there are likely more markets that have the scale to allow companies to grow to reach very valuable status.In the 16th century, the Dutch were the leading economic power. As things changed, the British became the leading economic power in the 18th and 19th century. As a result, some Dutch and British companies have made it to the list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.In the 20th century, the United States became the leading economic power. Immediately after World War II, the United States had around half the world's GDP and much of the world's wealth. With much of the world's wealth, many American companies had the capital necessary to expand overseas and gain substantial market share. With much of the world as potential markets, American companies can gain more revenue and potentially more profits. As a result of the dominance of the United States economically, many American companies make this list.Another factor that helps companies make it to the list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History is the era that they operate.In terms of eras, modern day companies are more likely to be more valuable given the growth in the global economy. Because economies have advanced so much over the past 100 years, the markets today are much larger than the markets 100 years ago. With globalization, modern day companies also have opportunities at a larger market.Story continuesThe emergence of technology has also created many valuable companies, some of which also make the list of the 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.With technology, companies can grow very quickly and potentially capture a monopoly on very valuable markets that many people use. Microsoft is one example with Windows. Given that technology may not cost all that much to produce after it's first created, some tech sectors can also have higher margins than other industries. With higher margins and larger markets, it can be easier for some tech companies to be considered very valuable.In terms of the composition of the 15 Most Valuable Companies In History, the majority are tech companies and many exist today.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History, we used peak market cap to rank the companies since some of the most valuable companies no longer exist today.

The company has completed a $102 million Series B funding round, which took the online skill-based gaming startup’s total fund raised to $121 million at a $600 million valuation.Zupee’s gaming platform features casual board games, such as ludo, carrom, snakes and ladders, etc. If the deal should go through, it could mean the integration of Microsoft's Azure cloud service with Zupee.The two firms have not reached an agreement and there is a reasonable chance that the deal will not materialize, the sources cautioned.

The proposed Hyderabad data center region will be Microsoft’s fourth in the country after Mumbai, Pune and Chennai.This makes Microsoft’s data center investment the second largest foreign direct investment in Telangana after AWS’ $2.77 billion FDI in its second Asia Pacific data center region in India.

These drive competitive advantage, and increase innovation and speed-to-market.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Genpact Limited G are some stocks that are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends. However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Industry DescriptionOutsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations, services or processes, previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources, to external resources or third-party contractors to improve operating efficiency by focusing on core business competencies. The Zacks Outsourcing industry comprises companies engaged in providing human capital management solutions, business management solutions and information technology solutions for human resource, payroll, benefits, and retirement and insurance services to small- and medium-sized businesses. Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry? A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Rising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Story continuesNotably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Security Issues and Remedies: Increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, increased implementation of secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees on emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #40. This rank places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The buy-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been increasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has increased 4.7%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can buy given their growth prospects, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Outsourcing industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 3.3% over this period against a 43% decline of the broader sector and 14.9% decline of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing outsourcing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.19X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.2X and the sector’s 21.31X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.89X, as low as 17.89X and at the median of 23.58X, as the charts below show.Forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E)3 Outsourcing Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that are well positioned to grow in the near term.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Automatic Data Processing: This New Jersey-based company provides cloud-based human capital management solutions worldwide. ADP’s three-tier business strategy helps it maintain and grow its strong position as a human capital management (HCM) technology and services provider. The company is focused on delivering a complete suite of cloud-based HCM and HR Outsourcing solutions. Strategic acquisitions like Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company have strengthened ADP’s customer base and are helping it expand operations in international markets. It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADP’s 2022 EPS has moved up 3.2% in the past 90 days. ADP’s shares have rallied 13.2% over the past year.Price &amp; Consensus: ADP Paychex: This New York-based company provides integrated human capital management solutions.Paychex continues to benefit from growth in its payroll client bases and product penetration across HCM offerings, resulting from strong sales performance and high levels of retention, high demand for HR Solutions, improved revenues per client resulting from higher employment levels within the company’s client base and enhanced price realization, and expansion of HCM ancillary services. An increase in the number of average worksite employees, the impact of an increase in average wages per worksite employee, higher revenues on state unemployment insurance and a rise in PEO health insurance revenues act as other tailwinds. Additionally, cost-saving initiatives result in sequential improvement of margins. Acquisitions have expanded Paychex's customer base besides generating cost and revenue synergies. Consistency in rewarding shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases boosts investor confidence and positively impacts earnings per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paychex’s 2022 EPS has improved 1.7% in the past 90 days. PAYX stock has declined 5.8% over the past year.Price &amp; Consensus: PAYX Genpact Limited: This Bermuda-based company provides business process outsourcing and IT services in North and Latin America, India, the rest of Asia and Europe.

If you want to read about some more fast money stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Raging inflation and high interest rates continue to weigh on consumer spending in the past few months, raising investor concerns around an economic recession in the United States that could slow down global growth. Final estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reveal that the US economy shrank for the second consecutive quarter in the three months ended June, meeting the technical criteria for a recession. The GDP shrank by 0.6% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, below the initially reported 0.9% decline. The numbers indicate that storm clouds are likely to hover over the marketplace in the coming months. However, not all is doom and gloom. Newly released job data shows that payrolls increased 275,000 in September, while the unemployment rate held at 3.7%. Per a recent survey, top US economists expect average hourly earnings to increase 0.3% month-over-month in September, compared to 5.1% from a year ago. The latter number is below the figures estimated for the month of August. In this macro environment, investors are eagerly looking for stocks that offer a healthier risk/reward ratio in the near-term, primarily because investments in traditional growth offerings are a no-go. Some of the best stocks to monitor in this regard include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), among others discussed in detail below. As policymakers try to beat inflation, these options could offer investors access to fast money. Our MethodologyThe companies that have upcoming growth catalysts were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

(NYSE:LYB) stock and lowered the price target to $85 from $92, noting that the company was seeing weaknesses across core segments driven by higher costs. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 37 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $953.5 million in LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

Chemical markets are currently robust given the combination of 2020 plant shutdowns and strongly recovering demand. Despite the tailwinds, Lyondell trades at a low valuation and yields just under 5%.”9. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), together with its subsidiaries, develops, owns, and operates integrated resorts in Asia and the United States. It is one of the top fast money stocks to invest in.

Steve Cohen, the owner of the Mets, is engaging city officials and casino owners to discuss the options to open a casino in Citi Field. The shares have also benefited from easing of virus restrictions across the globe. On September 26, Citi analyst George Choi maintained a Buy rating on Las Vegas Sands Corp.

For example, the business operations of Macau-centric casino and gaming companies such as Las Vegas Sands Corporation (NYSE:LVS) have yet to recover due to the ongoing COVID-19 challenges in China. We expect business to rebound sharply when economic growth recovers just as it did in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Sands Corporationis a global leader in the development and operation of luxury casino resorts in Macau and Singapore, and it maintains a liquid and investment grade balance sheet. It is currently valued at a significant discount to our assessment of replacement cost, and the company’s Macau operations are valued at only 7 times estimated cash flow.” 8.

Here is what the fund said:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases.

That is because the Oct 7, 2022 $94.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Archer Daniels shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Archer Daniels is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Agriculture - Operations industry that ranks in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.37 per share to $1.38 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Archer Daniels right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Synopsys (SNPS) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 36.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 29.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.1%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Synopsys has an S/TA ratio of 0.55, which means that the company gets $0.55 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.48, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Synopsys is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 20.8% this year versus the industry average of 5.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Synopsys a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Synopsys well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(SNPS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/synopsys-inc-snps-trending-stock-130001476.html,1665147601,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Synopsys (SNPS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of software used to test and develop chips have returned -3.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Synopsys belongs, has lost 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Synopsys is expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.21 indicates a change of +15.4% from what Synopsys is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Synopsys.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SNPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Synopsys, the consensus sales estimate of $1.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $5.08 billion and $5.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.8% and +12.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySynopsys reported revenues of $1.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18%. EPS of $2.10 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Synopsys is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Synopsys.

It has delivered an earnings surprise of 3.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Key Factors to NoteContinued strength in its global beverage and convenient food businesses has been acting as the key growth driver for PepsiCo. Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, Ready-to-Drink Tea and water categories, are likely to have aided growth in the beverage category. Investments in innovation, pricing and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.Strong realized prices across all segments are likely to have resulted in pricing gains in the quarter. The company has been witnessing revenue growth across all segments, which is expected to have continued in the third quarter.Also, PepsiCo’s cost-management and restructuring actions bode well. The company’s investments in brands, go-to-market systems, supply chains, manufacturing capacity and digital capabilities to build competitive advantages have been boosting the top and bottom lines.However, the company has been witnessing rising inflation stemming from the impacts of supply-chain disruptions as well as higher labor, transportation and commodity costs.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, PEP anticipated incremental input cost inflation for the quarter under review.

The network through which funds are transferred from the bank of origin directly into the bank account of a beneficiary facilitates a seamless and secure transfer of funds on a real-time basis worldwide.Therefore, the ulterior motive of the partnership is to make global corporate payments easier, safer, quicker and affordable. Additionally, better fee transparency, transaction accuracy, effective management of cash flows and simplified settlement are some of the other advantages offered by Visa B2B Connect.The latest move reinforces Visa’s continuous efforts to devise an enhanced cross-border payment system on the back of its innovative digital solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic compelled most organizations to transform their business models and increasingly adopt digital means while making payments.Further, through the enhancement of global payment processes, Visa targets some of the most critical headwinds dampening prospects of the extensive cross-border payments market. The challenges are mostly linked to systematic issues.TD shares a common aim with Visa to ease international cross-border payments conducted by corporate clients, thereby emerging as an apt partner.Visa’s intensifying focus on strengthening its foothold across the Canadian cross-border payments market can be clearly reflected in this latest move. With digital transformation efforts shaping every sphere of life, there is robust demand for convenient and affordable digital cross-border payment solutions.

65,38447ead-ce43-3811-836c-23f876e6297a,TDG,2022-10-08,7 Defense Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-defense-stocks-too-cheap-181447170.html,1664907287,STORY,"['ESLT', 'LHX', 'SAFRY', 'TDG', 'RTX', 'HII']","[Due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, defense stocks naturally gained significant relevance. Moreover, the aggressor’s escalation of the military conflict — met with stout Ukrainian resistance and successful counteroffensives — implies that the crisis will continue on for some time. Cynically, this dynamic boosts military-related investments, but that’s arguably not the main catalyst. The core reason for defending Ukraine against Russian aggression comes down to prevention of future catastrophes.Indeed, the U.S. and its allies share various rivals. Aside from Russia, North Korea recently escalated tensions in the Asia-Pacific region with ballistic missile tests. China may also feel emboldened to forward its international interests in the future. To try to mitigate and avoid potential future conflicts with these and other nations, the West is largely responding to Russian aggression with its support of Ukraine and investing its own defense systems.Ultimately, defense stocks protect global democracies and the sovereign right of self-determination. Over the long run, that’s a net positive for all of us.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRTXRaytheon Technologies$85.39HIIHuntington Ingalls$230.62LHXL3Harris Technologies$223.66SAFRYSafran$24.43TDGTransDigm$560.52ESLTElbit Systems$196.83POWWAmmo Inc$3.04Raytheon Technologies (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the more prominent defense stocks that happens to deliver a solid discount, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) partnered with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to produce the Javelin anti-tank missile. Used to great effect by Ukrainian resistance forces, the Javelin prevented Russian heavy armor from infiltrating Kyiv. Later, Raytheon’s Stinger anti-aircraft missile provided critical cover for Ukrainian ground troops.Despite the enormous relevancies to the current conflict, RTX slipped more than 4% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis through Oct. 3. To be fair, the major equity indices suffered double-digit losses over the same period. As well, the red ink provides an opportunity for contrarian investors to scoop up a discount. Over time, as Russia doubles down stubbornly in its war, the need for reliable defense stocks increases significantly.Story continuesPresently, Gurufocus.com labels RTX as fairly valued. I can’t complain with this framework, even though it features a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.4 times, under the industry median of 16 times. Most importantly, future demand for Raytheon’s products should increase, fundamentally making it an undervalued opportunity.Huntington Ingalls (HII)The Huntington Ingalls logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAmong the most relevant defense stocks to buy, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) represents the largest military shipbuilding company in the U.S. Moving forward, two catalysts should help propel HII in a northly direction.First, the Coast Guard struggles to find recruits to fill available roles. As defenders of America’s maritime borders, the Coast Guard needs to be ready at all times to protect against threats. With dangers at sea rising in recent years, the federal government may call upon Huntington to address critical needs.Per Gurufocus.com, Huntington Ingalls is fairly valued. It’s possible that HII is slightly on the undervalued scale, given its forward PE of 12.6 times. As well, the underlying company features solid revenue growth and robust profitability metrics.L3Harris Technologies (LHX)L3Harris (LHX) sign outsideSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA defense contractor and information technology services provider, L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) represents one of the top defense stocks tethered to the digital front lines. As well, the company provides advanced solutions across the spectrum of military needs, affording L3Harris incredible flexibility.Currently, LHX performs decently, though not outstandingly. Since the start of the year, LHX has gained nearly 5%. Looking ahead, investors will want to pay close attention to the company.As with the other defense stocks, Gurufocus.com labels LHX as fairly valued. However, based on the urgency of the underlying sector, L3Harris arguably provides a significant discount. Even on paper, LHX features a forward PE ratio of under 15 times, ranked better than 67% of defense firms.In addition, L3Harris enjoys excellent growth and profitability metrics. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 19.8%, rated better than 87% of its competitors. Also, its net margin is 11.4%, better than 79% of its peers.Safran (SAFRY)image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocksSource: ShutterstockA French multinational company, Safran (OTCMKTS:SAFRY) primarily designs, develops and manufactures aircraft and rocket engines. In addition, Safran provides defense-related equipment and components. Perhaps most notably given the Ukraine conflict, the defense firm features a drones and robotics arm.To arguably most American investors, SAFRY represents a little-known enterprise. Perhaps not surprisingly then, Safran shares have slipped more than 20% YTD. Surely, being traded in the over-the-counter market doesn’t help. At the same time, SAFRY may be one of the defense stocks that are too cheap to ignore.According to Gurufocus.com, Safran’s business rates as modestly undervalued. On this front, the company features a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of just under 16 times. In comparison, the industry median is 21 times. In addition, Safran enjoys decent profitability metrics, including an operating margin of 11.5%, ranked better than 75% of its peers.Finally, SAFRY features robust momentum. Over the trailing five days — despite broader market volatility — shares gained 4%.TransDigm (TDG)A magnifying glass zooms in on the TransDigm Group, Inc. (TDG) logo on their webpageSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comFocused on the aerospace manufacturing industry, TransDigm (NYSE:TDG) represents a leading global producer of engineered aerospace components. Interestingly, under its Armtec Defense Technologies business, TransDigm provides infrared decoy flares to protect pilots against heat-seeking missiles. In addition, it also manufactures chaff to help fool radar-guided missiles. Should conflict zones heat up, demand for TransDigm products will likely increase.Still, not everyone on Wall Street recognizes the forward-looking potential of TDG and similar defense stocks. Since the January opener, TransDigm shares find themselves down more than 12%. Cynically, though, this framework could change in a hurry.From a purely investment perspective, market participants can’t afford to ignore how cheap TDG is. Per Gurufocus.com, TransDigm features a modestly undervalued business. Significant highlights include the company’s three-year revenue growth rate of 6.2% (rated better than 65% of aerospace firms) and net margin of 15.6% (rated better than 83% of its rivals).Elbit Systems (ESLT)Hermes 900 drone at a showcaseSource: Jordan Tan / Shutterstock.comBased in Israel, Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT) offers relevancies across a wide range of defense, security and commercial programs. This includes unmanned aircraft systems and electronic warfare and countermeasure systems. Given how the conflict in Ukraine articulated the need for intelligence and communications in modern warfare, Elbit should have no trouble marketing its platforms.Compared to other defense stocks, Wall Street apparently recognizes the value undergirding ESLT. Since the beginning of this year, ESLT has gained 13%. However, over the trailing month, Elbit shares bled off about 5% of market value. Thus, from a technical point of view, prospective investors can grab a near-term discount.Fundamentally as well, ESLT arguably represents a cheap name among defense stocks. Gurufocus.com rates Elbit as modestly undervalued. The investment resource provides an excellent breakdown of the underlying financial proposition. To put it succinctly, Elbit features strengths across the board with excellent growth and profitability metrics. It also features a decently stable balance sheet.Ammo Inc (POWW)many ammunition bullets pattern backgroundSource: ThomasLENNE / Shutterstock.comThe most speculative name on this list of cheap defense stocks, Ammo Inc (NASDAQ:POWW) designs and produces ammunition products for both recreational and law enforcement and military use.The company stands among the more intriguing defense stocks. Last year, Ammo generated some headlines when it won a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. Specifically, the government tasked Ammo to “design and manufacture multiple Ballistically Matched Multi-Purpose Rounds (BM-MPR) in support of U.S. military operations.”To be fair, Gurufocus.com labels POWW as a possible value trap. Therefore, if you can’t stand volatility, you may be better served with undervalued blue-chip defense stocks. However, for the adventurous, Ammo features a three-year book growth rate of 68.6%, beating out over 95% of defense companies. Also, it enjoys solid profitability metrics to boot.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

At this fund, the executive worked for its small and medium business funds for both Canadian and American companies. After leaving Burgundy in 2007, the now hedge fund executive set up BloomberSen a couple of months later in February 2008.BloombergSen describes itself as a long term, value investor. Through this, the firm evaluates its investment decisions over the course of five to ten years, as opposed to monthly or annually evaluating them like some of its other peers. This also provides it with tax benefits and low costs as the investments remain in its portfolio for a longer time period. Additionally, the firms that it chooses to invest in often have stable revenue, strong market positions, and low competition - which then ends up benefitting the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation process through lower volatility. A DCF model projects a company's cash flow into the future and adjusts it with the cost of capital and debt to wager a guess at the current true value to determine whether the market share price is under or overvalued.Story continuesAdditionally, the hedge fund does not open its doors to anyone, and if someone is looking to invest with BloombergSen, then a minimum investment of $2 million is required. It also selects only those firms whose shares are significantly undervalued on the public stock market, which then ensures that the portfolio as a whole is protected from both economic downturns and other volatility factors.By the end of this year's second quarter, BloombergSen had a portfolio that was worth $1.6 billion. In this portfolio, some top firms that are well known globally are W. R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB), Aon plc (NYSE:AON), and Colliers International Group Inc.

That said, YouTube’s user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company’s overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70    Dividend Yield as of October 6: 3.63% An American multinational pharmaceutical industry company, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is one of the best dividend stocks on our list due to its strong dividend history. The company was a part of 70 hedge fund portfolios in Q2 2022, down from 79 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds hold a collective value of over $2.8 billion. In September, Pfizer Inc.

The company paid $4.5 billion in dividends to shareholders, which shows that its FCF is stable for shareholder returns. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend Stocks for Growth11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To BuyTop 10 REIT Stocks Under $10Disclosure.

(NYSE:GS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 74% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-nyse-130103843.html,1665147663,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goldman Sachs Group. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Goldman Sachs Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Goldman Sachs Group is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.1% and 6.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$507m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

However, now things are taking a turn. It is now focusing on data centers since that is where most of the action lies. Iron Mountain has realized that for the company to stay afloat and relevant, it must focus on what is trending and in demand, which data storage currently is. Iron Mountain has easily made this transition and switch and looks forward to helping other companies with their data needs in the coming years.For the last few quarters, Iron Mountain’s investments in digitalizing its storage business are starting to pay off. That creates a more stable foundation for the company’s increasing dividends, which should lead to higher future returns. That makes Iron Mountain an attractive option for passive income seekers.However, IRM is down by double digits in the last six months. Aside from the general bearish momentum, shares are also treading downwards after revealing Project Matterhorn’s growth targets. The company is targeting $7.3 billion in annual revenue for 2026, representing a 10% compounded annual growth rate, and the project will play a big part. But the company will need to cover $150 million in one-time costs from 2023 to 2025. This is needed for transformation support as well. The markets don’t seem to be happy with that. Nevertheless, it means Iron Mountain is among the best undervalued REITs right now.Rayonier (RYN)An hourglass filled with blue sand sits on top of $100 bills.Source: ShutterstockRayonier (NYSE:RYN) is attractive because it’s involved in a critical commodity aside from being a REIT. It does not own office space or recreational properties. Instead, it owns huge tracts of timberland.Rayonier is one of the largest timberland owners in the world, with nearly three million acres of land under its control. The company’s holdings are located in the southern and northwestern United States and New Zealand.Rayonier benefits from the business model on two levels. First, due to the boom in commodity prices we are experiencing, timber prices will remain high for some time to come. Secondly, the underlying value of the land will continue rising on a secular level, becoming a hedge against inflation. It allows the company to maintain a very healthy dividend, which it hiked 5.6% in May.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Global Head of Sustainable Investing and Stewardship Julie Moret highlights examples on how active ownership works with human rights and diversity.We believe that companies who purposely manage environmental, social, and governance issues are well positioned for long-term success. When poorly managed, they can detract from financial performance and create risk. Importantly, direct engagement with companies on these issues can be supportive of financial performance, and potentially reduce investment risk. Let's take a look at two quick examples related to human rights and diversity.Companies should ensure sound human rights practices not only for their own employees, but also of those of their suppliers. Otherwise, they face the risk of supply disruption and reputational damage. A 2020 study by the World Benchmarking Alliance showed very low marks for the automotive sector on this issue.We followed up with German automaker, Daimler, now Mercedes-Benz, because the company scored relatively high versus competitors. Among all their sustainable practices, we learned the company identified and audited high risk suppliers, such as cobalt miners. As a result, the company required an industry recognized certification for more responsible mining. Learning about these practices helped us with similar future engagements with auto firms.We believe that a company can achieve more success when it encourages a diversity of talent, perspectives, and backgrounds. In fact, a 2020 McKinsey study found that top quartile companies in terms of ethnic and cultural diversity outperform those in the fourth quartile by 36% in profitability. Diversity starts at the top, so we set a standard that all boards globally be at least 20% female and boards in the US additionally have at least one ethnically or racially diverse director. Otherwise, we withhold support from the chair of the nominating committee or the highest tenured director on the nominating committee.Story continuesTo encourage sustainable business practices, we think investors should take an active stewardship role through engagement with companies and purposeful proxy voting. By integrating sustainable investment and stewardship, investors can manage risks and improve performance in their portfolios.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Northern Trust on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Northern TrustWebsite: www.northerntrust.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Northern TrustView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719516/ESG-Investing-Engaging-With-Companies-on-Human-Rights-and-Diversity]"

Discovery, consider bundling their various services along with its streaming packages.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: We could soon be seeing more streamers partnering for bundles. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Amazon executives have been exploring selling bundles of streaming services at discounted prices through its Amazon Prime Video channels. And the Journal also reporting that Warner Brothers Discovery has discussed eventually participating in bundles with some of its rivals. It really does seem as if we're coming full circle.But I mean, we're seeing some analysts saying we're not going back to the days of cable, not to compare it, because he was saying-- and this was from Devin Emery of Curiosity. He was saying that the problem with bundling wasn't that people didn't like it. They weren't liking what they were paying for a service that they weren't really using. So a bit of nuance there, though, Seana. Would you agree, though?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, but I guess my only response to that would be, I guess, if you pay for a bundle, I don't know if you would necessarily use everything that's included in that bundle. So that would be interesting to see. And also just in terms of the pricing, that's going to be key. We don't really know from this report from the Journal exactly what Amazon is thinking, if Prime is going to be included in these bundles, or if they're thinking of maybe partnering with some other streamers and bundling their services.It's very, very vague just in terms of where they see the direction of this going. Dave, though, I do think it is a natural step in order for us to see more of these types of bundle offers, though, just given the fact that growth there within the sector has been so hard for so many of the leaders here within streaming. We certainly have seen saturation. So many companies are trying to be innovative in terms of what they're doing to drive new customers, to get new customers into their service here. Ad tier is part of that, but bundling, I think, makes sense. So it'll be interesting, though, to see how they do it.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Well, we just showed the two main bundles that do exist right now with the leader out of the gate, really, is that one on your left there. Disney bundle has Disney, Hulu, and ESPN+. And that makes a lot of sense for people. That's a 44% discount off of if you paid for all three of those services separately.But now, some research from CR Research shows that the average consumer is spending $219 a month right now between cable and their streaming services. So everything we got away from, we are now back in. And that's why the Wall Street Journal calls it the great rebundling. Perhaps the best example of what Amazon might do is what Walmart's doing with their membership, now getting a deal with Paramount+ and partnering there.But there's no natural streamer that fits with Amazon Prime because they have everything in the space now with movies and television shows and now live sports. I can't imagine who a natural partner would be. But yes, we're getting back to exactly what we ran away from.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it's tough because when you figure in Walmart, their service is already $98, so are people just going to do these sort of mini bundles? Will there be a bunch of overlap if you want a bit of something and something else? Do you have to get two bundles? It's a lot. I'm not looking forward to it. But hey, if it gives us more options, we can save, like, 44%. I will do the bundling math. I will try.]"

In that report, analysts expect TJX to post earnings of $0.80 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 4.76%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.27 billion, down 2.08% from the year-ago period.TJX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $49.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +9.12% and +2.55%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for TJX. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

When development is successful, HHS buys the products for national preparedness.Concerns about potential use of nuclear weapons have risen after Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued warnings in recent weeks that he is ready to use them to defend Russia, cautioning it was no bluff.The White House has said repeatedly that it has seen no indication that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons despite what it calls Putin's ""nuclear saber-rattling.""President Joe Biden said on Thursday the threat by Putin to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine has brought the world closer to ""Armageddon"" than at any time since the Cold-War Cuban Missile Crisis.Radiation sickness occurs when a person's entire body is exposed to a high dose of penetrating radiation, reaching internal organs in a matter of seconds.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Albemarle (ALB) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.95 a share, just 26 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 2, 2022.Albemarle's Earnings ESP sits at 2.11%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.95 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.81.ALB is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Newmont Corporation (NEM).Newmont Corporation is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 27, 2022. NEM's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.69 a share 20 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Newmont Corporation is $0.65, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 6.15%.Story continuesALB and NEM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.General Dynamics could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics peKeen to find out how analysts think General Dynamics' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is General Dynamics' Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, General Dynamics would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 3.4%. The latest three year period has also seen a 5.9% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per annum, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that General Dynamics is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On General Dynamics' P/EIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Our examination of General Dynamics' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for General Dynamics that you need to take into consideration.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

The work related to the deal will be performed in Groton, CT, and Newport News, VA.The contract is valued at $532.9 million and is expected to be completed by October 2023. Per the contract, General Dynamics Electric Boat will provide lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia-class attack submarines.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly for upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. To this end, military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form integral parts of any nation’s defense system.Therefore, the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines. The unit has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy.In this regard, the business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines. General Dynamics plans to invest $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support growth in submarine construction.Peer MovesNations are reinforcing their defense capabilities to deter any warfare-like situation. Per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% between 2022 and 2031. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few defense primes that can reap the multitude of gains from the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines are the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines and can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 9.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2022 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 9.4%.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. Northrop Grumman also provides launch systems for submarines. Its eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. NOC delivered an average earnings surprise of 3.9% in the last four quarters.Huntington Ingalls has a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines. Its division, Newport News, is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2022 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 13.6%.

The refineries, however, are coming back online and California officials allowed less expensive winter-blend gasoline to be sold a month in advance, bringing drivers relief. California pump prices dropped Friday to $6.39. The upper Midwest, meanwhile, saw gas prices spike after a deadly explosion and fire at a refinery in Toledo, Ohio.“While the West Coast might see some price easing, it’s going to be a little while in the upper Midwest,” Gross said.Overall, gas prices vary across state lines due to proximity to oil refineries and pipelines, and issues at the plants, and state taxes. “When supply is adequate in every region and when there are no refinery issues, really the only difference you see between states and regions is the difference in gasoline taxes,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a company that tracks oil and gas markets.Story continuesWhy are gas prices higher in California than Kansas?: Gas experts break down costs from state to stateSave at the pump: How to save money as gas prices hit all-time high with Russian invasion of UkraineWhat does the OPEC+ decision mean for US drivers?Prices at the pump may go up on the East Coast, as well as in the South, Northeast and the Rockies because of the OPEC+ decision, said De Haan.The West Coast, Great Lakes and Plains, meanwhile, could see prices drop as refinery issues in the area improve. But with OPEC+ cutting production, prices may not go down as much as they could have otherwise, De Haan said.“Everyone's gonna feel the impact to the tune of 10 to 30 cents, ” De Haan said.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is headquartered in Vienna.Why is OPEC+ cutting production?OPEC+ said the move was based on the “uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks,” the Associated Press reported.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the group is adjusting supply ahead of a possible dip in demand, according to AP.The OPEC+ decision, De Haan said, could put the global economy in a “very precarious place because there is very little margin for error.”“I think there's more oil production needed,” De Haan said. “OPEC is doing this cut at a very inopportune time – global oil inventories remain very tight.”President Joe Biden called the move “disappointing,” and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president considered the decision “short-sighted” as the global economy still reels from the impact of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, AP reported.What has Biden done to try to rein in gas prices?After OPEC+’s announcement, Biden said Thursday his administration is looking at “alternatives” to lower gas prices.Biden in March ordered the release of 1 million barrels of crude oil a day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months and told oil producers to immediately cut costs for Americans. “There's not a lot any administration can do – Republican or Democrat – when oil prices started to go up because oil is a global commodity,” Gross said. “We don't set the price here in this country, nor do we set the price for gasoline.”Contributing: Associated Press This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Why are gas prices higher in California than in Texas?]"

98,db691e2e-036c-3683-bf89-5abb6aa9fcb1,NOV,2022-10-08,"UPDATE 1-U.S. natgas futures down 3% on record output, mild weather forecasts",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-natgas-futures-down-193126865.html,1665171086,STORY,['NG=F'],"[(New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments) Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell about 3% on Friday on record output and continued milder than normal weather that will allow utilities to keep injecting more gas into storage than usual in coming weeks. Also weighing on gas prices was a drop in demand from power outages due to storms and reduced liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Over 134,000 homes and businesses were still without power in Florida after Hurricane Ian hit on Sept. 28-29, reducing the amount of gas power generators need to burn to produce electricity. Ian knocked out power to over 4 million in Florida and 1.1 million in North Carolina and South Carolina. Gas demand was also reduced by outages at LNG export plants, including Berkshire Hathaway Energy's 0.8-billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) Cove Point in Maryland for about three weeks of planned work starting Oct. 1 and Freeport LNG's 2.0-bcfd plant in Texas for unplanned work after an explosion on June 8. Freeport LNG expects the facility to return to at least partial service in early to mid-November. Front-month gas futures fell 22.4 cents, or 3.2%, to settle at $6.748 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). On Thursday, the contract closed at its highest since Sept. 22 for a second day in a row. For the week, the front-month fell less than 1%, putting the contract down for seven weeks in a row for the first time since January 2015. U.S. futures were up about 81% so far this year as soaring global gas prices fed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Gas was trading around $45 per mmBtu in Europe and $34 in Asia. That was a 9% drop for prices in Europe. Russian gas exports via the three main lines into Germany - Nord Stream 1 (Russia-Germany), Yamal (Russia-Belarus-Poland-Germany) and the Russia-Ukraine-Slovakia-Czech Republic-Germany route - have averaged just 1.3 bcfd so far in October, the same as September but well below 9.2 bcfd seen in October 2021. TOP PRODUCER Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 100.1 bcfd so far in October from a monthly record of 99.4 bcfd in September. With cooler weather coming, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 89.9 bcfd this week to 91.4 bcfd next week and 93.7 bcfd in two weeks. The forecast for this week was lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday. The average amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants fell to 10.8 bcfd so far in October from 11.5 bcfd in September. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March. The seven big U.S. export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG. So far this year, most U.S. LNG has gone to countries in Europe as they wean themselves off Russian energy. Russia, the world's second-biggest gas producer, has provided about a third of Europe's gas in recent years, totaling about 18.3 bcfd in 2021. The European Union wants to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and refill stockpiles to 80% of capacity by Nov. 1 and 90% by Nov. 1 each year beginning in 2023. Gas stockpiles in northwest Europe - Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands - were currently about 7% above their five-year (2017-2021) average for this time of year, according to Refinitiv. Storage was currently around 92% of capacity. That is much healthier than U.S. gas inventories, which were still about 8% below their five-year norm.

The SPR — the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil — was established back in 1975 in case of a severe oil supply crisis or economic disruption.Biden’s decision comes after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) said it would slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day — putting extra pressure on the global energy supply.However, with the country’s emergency reserve already at its lowest levels since 1984, some experts have concerns about the long-term implications.Don’t missInvest your spare change and turn your pennies into a productive portfolioA TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by cash stuffingYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and KrogerU.S. gas prices are going up againGas prices hit a record high of $5.02 a gallon in June after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but this summer saw a 99-day streak of lower prices due to recession fears and declining oil prices.However, even before OPEC+ declared it would be cutting back on oil production, gas prices began inching back up again in late September. This may have been due to a combination of increasing demand, refinery issues and the upcoming European ban on Russian oil.Now with OPEC+’s recent decision, prices are expected to escalate even further. The group says the production cuts are being made due to “the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.”As of Oct. 7, the average national gas price was $3.89 per gallon, which is about 10 cents higher than the week before, according to AAA.Biden disappointed by 'shortsighted' production cutHours after the OPEC+ announcement, the White House said the president was disappointed by “the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas” as the global economy is still contending with the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesThe press release noted that 10 million barrels of oil would be drained from the SPR and the Secretary of Energy would be exploring other options to increase domestic production.Read more: Do you fall in America's lower, middle, or upper class? How your income stacks upBiden also urged gas companies to keep bringing gas prices down.Why making big withdrawals from the reserve could be riskySince March, the Energy Department has released 160 million barrels of crude oil, or over a quarter of the stockpile — draining the SPR to its lowest levels in four decades.As of Sept. 30, the reserve has dropped to 416 million barrels, according to department data.The Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) stated back in Nov. 2021 that it strongly opposed tapping into oil stockpiles to counter gas prices. The group’s concern was that depleting the emergency reserve could put the U.S. at risk if the global or domestic oil supply reaches dangerously low levels before the supply can be brought back up.The IPAA recommends ramping up domestic natural gas and oil production instead, although oil producers are already dealing with supply-chain issues, limited capital and investor pressure to boost returns.Francisco Blanch, managing director and head of global commodities at Bank of America Global Research also voiced criticism in a segment on Bloomberg Television.“I don’t think it’s a great idea given the incredibly tense geopolitical world we live in today,” Blanch said. By using up the reserve, the U.S. could be putting itself “more in the hands of OPEC+ … eventually you’re just ceding more and more market control.”What to read next'I just can't wait to get out': Nearly three-quarters of pandemic homebuyers have regrets — here's what you need to know before you put in that offer'Remarkable reversal': President Biden just (quietly) scaled back student loan forgiveness — and the change could impact up to 1.5M borrowers.

However, the picture looks much different on a year-to-date basis, suffering a loss of more than 26%.According to Gurufocus.com, WYNN rates as fairly valued against its propriety valuation metrics. However, against traditional metrics, the narrative is so-so. Wynn enjoys a gross margin of 33.7%, which is middling for the travel and leisure industry. At the same time, it’s not entirely fair to bash the company based on “paper” assessments. For instance, Wynn and the casino sector suffered disproportionately during the coronavirus pandemic.Story continuesStill, WYNN represents one of the S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks to buy. That’s because, over time, the east-west cultural divide should play out favorably for Wynn’s Asian resorts. Essentially, revenue by segment data confirms that eastern patrons prefer gambling, whereas western patrons enjoy experiences. Since games of chance offer multiple revenue cycles per unit of time, WYNN may be a surprisingly viable idea once international markets normalize.NRG Energy (NRG)Close up of NRG logo on website against blurred background.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) primarily focuses on energy generation and retail electricity. According to its website, the company provides power-related services to six million customers. Fundamentally, then, the company enjoys inelastic demand at the baseline. While economic forces always influence consumer behavior, every household consumes a basic threshold of electricity.Still, NRG doesn’t quite attract much attention for this inelasticity, thereby making it one of the S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks. While the stock gained almost 3% on Monday, it has lost more than 8% for the year. True, it’s performing much better than the benchmark index, but it arguably deserves better. Never mind – it’s an opportunity for contrarian investors.Gurufocus.com labels it as a possible value trap. I cannot entirely agree with this assessment. For instance, NRG’s three-year compound annual revenue growth rate stands at 43%, which is better than most of its sector peers. In addition, the company commands solid profitability metrics — for example, NRG’s net margin pings at just under 12%, above the industry median.Campbell Soup (CPB)A variety of Campbell's soups in a grocery store. CPB stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / ShutterstockAlthough always relevant because of its low-cost food products, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) ranks among S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks to buy. Unfortunately, the reality is that the company presents a boring business profile. Following the almost narcotics-fueled joyride of 2021, pivoting to CPB seems rather dull. It’s merely the nature of the beast.Moving forward, investors have two ways of looking at Campbell Soup. First, they will recognize that CPB gained 9% YTD. Given the slow-rising nature of the underlying business, this might not draw many fans to the investment opportunity. Indeed, TipRanks notes that among eight analysts, six of them have a consensus hold rating. The remaining experts rate CBP shares as a sell.Second, other investors may appreciate that the framework of the broader markets has shifted. Rather than rewarding risk-on ideas, the equities sector turned deflationary (i.e., red ink). Therefore, companies with well-established businesses may win out.In that case, CPB – which Gurufocus.com labels as fairly valued – may be undervalued in context. Since discretionary spending faded, core spending may run stable or rise.Advance Auto Parts (AAP)Advance Auto Parts store exterior and signSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPerhaps one of the most fundamentally underappreciated S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks, investors should pay close attention to Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP). Mainly, its bullish narrative focuses on the record age of vehicles (12.2 years) on U.S. roadways. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, many households struggled to make ends meet. Therefore, it’s not surprising that cars have become long in the tooth.Cynically, though, this framework bolsters AAP. With the underlying business specializing in aftermarket parts, demand may increase as consumers attempt to keep their rides running. At the same time, Wall Street doesn’t appreciate this narrative, with shares down 31% YTD. To be sure, at some point, it makes more financial sense just to buy a new (or new-ish) car rather than to repair a money pit.Still, for the bold contrarian, Gurufocus.com labels AAP modestly undervalued. Advance Auto features a three-year revenue growth rate of 9.6%, better than 70% of its peers. The company has a net margin of 4.8% on the profitability spectrum. This is better than the industry’s median of 2.5%.Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWith the focus of this article on S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks, invariably, some riskier ideas will pop up. Naturally, mentioning this tidbit provides an excellent segue into Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ). A fan favorite following its corporate do-over, Domino’s should perform well with football season underway. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve also opened its season for a game of, “How high can interest rates go before the economy collapses?”While I jest, the framework remains unpleasant for the consumer economy. Sadly, some analysts predict that the quick-service pizza segment could suffer weak same-restaurant sales. If so, DPZ could tank.On the other hand, recessions tend to create desires for channels of escapism. Frankly, there may not be a more effective form of escapism than a steaming hot (and reasonably priced) pizza delivered to your door.Clearly, the fundamentals can go either way for Domino’s Pizza. However, if you use Gurufocus.com as an arbiter, the investment resource rates DPZ as significantly undervalued. Basically, the website urges investors not to ignore the company’s excellent longer-term growth and profitability metrics.Iron Mountain (IRM)Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truckSource: ShutterstockSeemingly everyone loves talking about digitalization this and digitalization that. However, digital innovations tend to be somewhat fragile. For example, what if you accidentally pour water on your laptop? Boom! Your data is gone, and you’re left wishing you had an analog (paper) backup. Well, that’s one of the surprisingly viable but overlooked business units under Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM).Essentially, you can look at Iron Mountain as a company that keeps your data from turning into an odorous material that meets the proverbial fan. It offers both cloud-based storage solutions and good ole fashioned paper backups of critical documents. Still, Wall Street is no fan of IRM at the moment, with the security down 11% YTD.What’s more puzzling, Gurufocus.com labels IRM as modestly overvalued. Mathematically, you can make this argument because of share price premiums against historically lower growth rates. However, in the current paradigm, where several odious materials hit several proverbial fans, demand for Iron Mountain’s services should increase.For the forward-looking investor, IRM stands as one of the S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks to buy.NortonLifeLock (NLOK)a smartphone running NortonLifeLock (NLOK) softwareSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comThe riskiest idea among S&amp;P 500 sleeper stocks on this list, I can appreciate why investors overlook NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK). While the company provides a valuable cybersecurity service, the sector remains highly competitive. As well, NortonLifeLock may have a product evangelism dilemma. Computer users may suffer from a false assumption that cybersecurity solutions become irrelevant if they don’t do anything questionable on the internet.Add the troubling nature of the consumer economy today, and you immediately incur a rigid framework for NLOK stock. Nevertheless, cyber breaches and identity theft incidents only need to happen once for people to wake up. With experts in the field forecasting a rise in cyberattacks, NortonLifeLock may receive a cynical benefit.Again, if you use Gurufocus.com as an investing resource, it has good news: it rates NLOK as modestly undervalued. Perhaps surprisingly, NortonLifeLock features decent growth metrics and solid profitability indicators for some folks. For instance, the company has a net margin of over 30%, ranked better than nearly 96% of its peers.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The rate, if approved by the commission, will allow the company to generate funds required for an upgrade of the electric grid, which will lower the duration of outages and create resistance against extreme weather. Investments made by Duke Energy Progress in the past five years have helped to save more than 3 million hours of total lost outage time for customers. This is the first-rate appeal from the Duke Energy unit since 2019 and the proposed rate hike, if approved by NCUC, will be implemented in the next three years. The net increase in retail revenues in year one is about $326 million or 8.5%, followed by $151 million (3.9%) in year two and $138 million (3.6%) in year three – a total 16% increase by late 2025. Rate hikes impact the monthly expenses of customers, but a reasonable rate increase is the only way to allow utility operators to recover the expenses made to strengthen their infrastructure for providing reliable services to customers. The new Customer Assistance Program proposed by the Duke Energy unit, as part of the rate case, can assist customers in financial distress.Utilities Invest in InfrastructureThe domestic-focused regulated utilities continue to make investments in their infrastructure to ensure reliable supply and more energy generation from clean power sources. Duke Energy, by investing heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects, remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. DUK anticipates spending capital worth more than $130 billion over the next decade, with $63 billion during the 2022-2026 period. The long-term (three to five year) earnings growth of Duke Energy is currently pegged at 5.97%. Utilities in the same industry with well-chalked-out investment plans for strengthening their services are NextEra Energy NEE, American Electric Power Company, Inc. AEP and Exelon Corporation EXC.Story continues NextEra Energy aims to invest $85-$95 billion from 2022 through 2025 to strengthen its infrastructure. Courtesy of persistent renewable asset additions to its generation portfolio and execution across all business segments, NextEra Energy expects to witness a CAGR of more than 10% for earnings per share through 2025 from the 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.55. The long-term earnings growth of NextEra Energy is currently pegged at 9.66%. NextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). American Electric Power aims to invest approximately $24.8 billion in its transmission and distribution business during the 2022-2026 period to construct a more efficient grid and deliver custom energy solutions to customers. Such investments should enable AEP to make infrastructural upgrades in its transmission and distribution of utility services to resist adverse climate conditions and offer better facilities. Its long-term earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.11%. American Electric Power currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Exelon plans to invest nearly $29 billion during the 2022-2025 forecast period in regulated utility operations for grid modernization and to increase the resilience of its infrastructure to benefit customers. Such systematic investment is going to boost the long-term earnings of the company. The current dividend yield of the company is 3.4% and its long-term earnings growth is pegged at 7.11%.

With this deal, V aims to simplify the cross-border payments of the latter's corporate clients via its world-class digital capabilities. Thanks to the recent tie-up, TD emerges as the first Canadian financial institution to be part of the cross-border business-to-business (B2B) payments network, Visa B2B Connect. The network through which funds are transferred from the bank of origin directly into the bank account of a beneficiary facilitates a seamless and secure transfer of funds on a real-time basis worldwide.Therefore, the ulterior motive of the partnership is to make global corporate payments easier, safer, quicker and affordable. Additionally, better fee transparency, transaction accuracy, effective management of cash flows and simplified settlement are some of the other advantages offered by Visa B2B Connect.The latest move reinforces Visa’s continuous efforts to devise an enhanced cross-border payment system on the back of its innovative digital solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic compelled most organizations to transform their business models and increasingly adopt digital means while making payments.Further, through the enhancement of global payment processes, Visa targets some of the most critical headwinds dampening prospects of the extensive cross-border payments market. The challenges are mostly linked to systematic issues.TD shares a common aim with Visa to ease international cross-border payments conducted by corporate clients, thereby emerging as an apt partner.Visa’s intensifying focus on strengthening its foothold across the Canadian cross-border payments market can be clearly reflected in this latest move. With digital transformation efforts shaping every sphere of life, there is robust demand for convenient and affordable digital cross-border payment solutions. Thus, by adding more partners to its network, Visa B2B Connect offers Visa the perfect ground to capitalize on demand for enhanced digital solutions in the B2B payments space.Story continuesShares of Visa have lost 14.3% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 18.6%.

MGI also resorted to creating a solid digital arm for capitalizing on robust demand for hassle-free cross-border payments.Mastercard keeps an eye on partnering with global and regional financial service providers to modernize the money movement process for consumers and businesses. MA continues adhering to a digital partnership strategy and undertaking significant investments to enhance its digital capabilities. In September 2022, MA cemented its collaborative ties with TripLink to add better cross-border payment capabilities to its businesses in the Asia-Pacific region.Western Union remains the preferred partner for conducting money transfers, considering its expansive worldwide reach into billions of bank accounts, including millions of wallets and cards spanning more than 130 countries. WU has been entering into several collaborations for a while to solidify its digital arm, thus facilitating efficient management of global payments and boosting its customer experience.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the technology sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy Now.In spite of the Fed jacking up interest rates, the technology sector is continuing to attract investor attention in 2022. With rampant inflation still plaguing the market, the sector was expected to suffer from a loss in popularity. However, its cheaper valuation in a time of economic recession is managing to work in its favor. According to a Bloomberg article published this September, The Nasdaq 100 Index was 35% cheaper than its peak in 2020. Some of the best FAANG stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) still continued to rake in cash and maintain their earnings outlooks, inspiring confidence as far as investors were concerned.What are FAANG stocks?The acronym FAANG refers to the top five American technology companies in the market today: Facebook (now known as Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is not an option. The sheer size of the tech industry alone makes it the largest of its kind in the S&amp;P 500, making up almost 27% of the index. As a result, many investors are now being pulled towards durable businesses like the FAANG stocks.According to a Reuters article published this July, Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings results added to investor confidence in the tech sector, as they showed that the FAANG stocks were well-equipped to deal with a recession.

The inflation data commonly, represented by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rose 0.1% for the month of August after remaining unchanged from July, mostly because of the increasing prices of goods and services, including rents, food and healthcare.Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in his speech that the central bank would continue with its hawkish stance to bring inflation to its desired level of around 2%. Investors are now worried that the Fed’s aggressive tightening measures to curb inflation might derail economic growth in the near future. The impact of rising interest rates will increase the cost of borrowing, which will have a spiraling impact on consumer spending and unemployment. It will thus slow down economic growth, which may force the economy toward a recession.The broader index continues to bleed lately, with the S&amp;P 500, the DOW &amp; the Nasdaq declining 21.44%, 17.64%, and 29.22%, respectively, so far this year. The rising global geo-political tensions between Russia-Ukraine and China-Taiwan continue to dent investors’ sentiment.Thus, investors who wish to park their money to earn a sizable income in such a gloomy environment may keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks. These dividend stocks hold a long track of profitability and have a proven business model that helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions. Due to their matured business models, investors can expect a steady flow of income along with higher protection of capital against wild swings in their prices. It is often seen that companies that reward shareholders with a comparatively high dividend payout tend to outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Luxfer LXFR, Bank OZK OZK, The First of Long Island FLIC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Honeywell International HON that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Story continuesLuxfer is a materials technology company, specializing in the design, manufacture and supply of high-performance materials, components and gas cylinders.

116,3a1a53f0-4abe-3ed3-8fb4-a5423ca88c15,LMT,2022-10-08,Why Lockheed (LMT) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-lockheed-lmt-could-beat-161004510.html,1665159004,STORY,['LMT'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Lockheed Martin (LMT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This aerospace and defense company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 8.95%.For the last reported quarter, Lockheed came out with earnings of $1.99 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 per share, representing a surprise of 14.37%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $6.22 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.44 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.54%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Lockheed, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Lockheed has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Is Lockheed Martin Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.53bUS$6.71bUS$6.69bUS$6.72bUS$6.77bUS$6.85bUS$6.95bUS$7.06bUS$7.17bUS$7.30bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 0.83%Est @ 1.17%Est @ 1.4%Est @ 1.56%Est @ 1.67%Est @ 1.75% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.5% US$6.2kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.3b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.5%– 1.9%) = US$211bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$211b÷ ( 1 + 5.5%)10= US$124bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$175b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$400, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.833. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Generally, the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Stocks with a beta higher than 1.0 are more sensitive to the market’s movements, while those with a beta less than 1.0 are less susceptible.For those seeking shelter from volatility, three stocks – The Kroger Co. KR, General Mills GIS, and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ – would be great places to start.On top of carrying a beta of less than 1.0, all three have rock-solid dividend metrics, a significant positive that helps alleviate drawdowns in other positions.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs seen above, all three have widely outperformed the general market in 2022, indicating that buyers have defended the stocks at a much higher level than most.Let’s take a deeper look at each one.General MillsGeneral Mills is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores.

Due to the pandemic in 2020, many companies in the US cut their dividends due to weak earnings. Even so, dividend payments significantly accounted for overall returns. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, citing Bloomberg, the S&amp;P 500 companies that raised their dividends delivered a 12.7% return in 2020, compared with a 6.5% decline in the dividend cutters.The additional income earned through these dividends investments is beneficial for investors, especially in times of financial instability. This year, elite hedge funds are also growing bullish on high-dividend stocks as the market longs for yields due to growing inflation. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are mainly popular among investors as these companies have maintained decades-long dividend growth streaks, providing regular income to shareholders.Over the years, companies with strong dividend growth track records have performed well, outplaying their peers. Charles Schwab compiled Ned Davis Research’s data in its report on dividend investments. The report mentioned that companies that grew and initiated their dividends returned 13.74% from 1981 to 2020 versus a 10.3% return for the stocks that cut their dividends. The report also mentioned that reinvested dividends significantly increased overall S&amp;P 500 returns from 1990 to 2020.In the third quarter of 2022, dividend payments increased by $17.7 billion, compared with $17.6 billion in the previous quarter. Moreover, for the 12 months ending September 2022, US common dividend increases were $86.7 billion, up 20.7% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”12.

It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”11. Broadcom Inc.

(NYSE:GS) at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70    Dividend Yield as of October 6: 3.63% An American multinational pharmaceutical industry company, Pfizer Inc.

Its free cash flow stood at $7.4 billion, compared with $5.9 billion a quarter earlier. The company paid $4.5 billion in dividends to shareholders, which shows that its FCF is stable for shareholder returns. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend Stocks for Growth11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To BuyTop 10 REIT Stocks Under $10Disclosure.

Mr. Siegel recently appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ where he discussed his view on why now is an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors. Here are some comments from the professor of finance at one of the top business schools in the world:“If you’re a long-term investor, I would absolutely buy now. I think these are absolutely great long-term values. Could it go down more? Of course in the short-run and in bear markets (historical), it has gone down more. But when you’re talking about 16 times earnings and even if they are clipped by a recession, you shouldn’t just base it on recession earnings you should base it on longer-term earnings, which I think are very favorable looking beyond the dip. I think these are just absolutely excellent values. Short-term, anything can happen in the short term.”While short-term investors are unwinding their positions and triggering major sell-offs, they are in fact creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

Revenues are expected to be $258.7 million, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Green Thumb Industries Inc., the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

But when a physician in Australia asked Watson if there was a way to reduce packaging waste for a line of our pacemakers, he got to work connecting with the right people.This feedback galvanized our Global Operations and Supply Chain team to launch a pilot program to reduce waste from Attesta™, Azure™, and Astra™ pacemaker packages. The team recently completed the pilot with outstanding results: The project will save five tons of plastic and 20 tons of paper from the landfill over the next year, based on production forecasts for these devices.Reducing waste, increasing supply chain flexibilityDevice instructions help customers and are required by regulatory agencies - but they can also contribute to waste. The pacemaker packages previously included a multi-language CD and multiple sets of paper instructions, with relevant languages for each country they might be shipped to.Based on findings from the pilot project, Global Operations and Supply Chain moved most instructions online. If a device goes to a country that requires paper instructions, our local distribution centers now add only a single set of paper instructions.This approach is called last-mile customization: Devices remain in a standard format for as long as possible and are customized when there is demand.""We can be more flexible to make sure we're supporting customers no matter where they are in the world and what regulatory requirements are in place,"" said Guillaume Mestrallet, business process improvement manager, who led the project's implementation. ""And we're also doing the right thing for the environment by removing waste from our processes.""The project's success required global coordination. Teams verified whether 200 countries would accept online instructions. Paper instructions were moved from manufacturing sites to distribution centers, which must meet regulatory requirements for packaging and labeling. And all changes were implemented according to our internal quality system, including design and production controls.Story continuesThis experience may serve as a guide for other product lines. And it sets a foundation for digital transformation activities in Global Operations and Supply Chain.""I'm excited for the future. For us to be a digital business, we need to learn how to separate some of these final manufacturing configurations,"" said Sheila Minske, engineering capital director, who developed the project's strategy.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Harley-Davidson (HOG) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.45 a share 19 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.45 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.44 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Harley-Davidson has an Earnings ESP of 0.6%.HOG is one of just a large database of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Goodyear (GT).Goodyear is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 4, 2022. GT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.63 a share 28 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Goodyear is $0.61, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.13%.Story continuesHOG and GT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Republic Services has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Waste Connections has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that RSG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.RSG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 27.94, while WCN has a forward P/E of 35.94. We also note that RSG has a PEG ratio of 2.46. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. WCN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.84.Another notable valuation metric for RSG is its P/B ratio of 4.57. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WCN has a P/B of 5.04.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to RSG's Value grade of B and WCN's Value grade of C.RSG has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than WCN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that RSG is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:MRK) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/75-ownership-merck-co-inc-130057102.html,1665147657,STORY,['MRK'],"[If you want to know who really controls Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 75% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Merck. See our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Merck does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Merck's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Merck. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$169m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Merck. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Merck has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

But the drug showed no benefit compared to taking a placebo in reducing hospitalizations.An analysis of real-world data from a separate study dubbed the Clalit study, conducted in Israel, showed that in a cohort of non-hospitalized, high-risk patients, molnupiravir reduced hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years and above.No benefit was found in younger adults ages 40 to 64 years.Additional data from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial showed that a lower proportion of molnupiravir-treated participants in the modified intent-to-treat population had an acute care visit or a COVID-19-related acute care visit versus a placebo.Price Action: MRK shares closed lower by 1.07% at $87.44 on Thursday.See more from BenzingaVerve's Stock Price Could Continue To Rise Through Clinical Progress - Despite Worries About ""DeeperPocketed"" CompetitionAnaptysBio / GSK-Partnered Immuno-Oncology Agent Meets Primary Goal In Lung Cancer TrialNew Book Shows Donald Trump Treated White House Like Movie Or TV Gig: 'Before I Did The Presidency' - DigDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Rockwell Automation Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Patricia Watson bought US$244k worth of shares at a price of US$220 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$233 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for Rockwell Automation share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price.

These groups are completely voluntary and employee-led, and unite employees around a common cause or shared life experiences. Although they have been around since the 1960s, ERGs have grown in popularity recently and are shown to create a sense of belonging and help retain talent at companies. Illumina is an example of a life science company that has embraced ERGs-it has established eight different ERGs and launched its newest one, iLatinx, for its Latinx-identifying employees in September 2021 during National Hispanic Heritage Month. Over the past year, the company says iLatinx has grown to 175 members, and is one of the company's most active ERGs.Natalie M. Crew, Illumina's global events lead and San Diego events lead, said the group was started by a few employees who came together once they observed the lack of a Latinx/Hispanic ERG at the company. Hispanics are also underrepresented in the STEM field, occupying just eight percent of the life science workforce and eight percent of STEM job nationally, according to a 2021 report from the Pew Research Center. ""There was one established ERG at the company, SHADES, that is designed to be a space for all people of color. I had been with the company only about one year, and there was one gentleman who was spearheading this effort for iLatinx. He spread his fire and got many of us excited for the possibility of creating a Latinx group,"" Crew said.In addition to being a forum for employee discussions and a space for leadership development opportunities, iLatinx members regularly engage in community outreach where they mentor students and expose them to STEM concepts and careers, and are active partners with programs such as the Biocom California Institute's Generation STEAM. Members of iLatinx organized Illumina's company-wide effort for the Barrio Logan STEAM Block Party at the San Diego Festival of Science &amp; Engineering this past spring and provided funding to support this year's Girls Who Lead student summer camp, which included hosting a workshop and tour. They also volunteered at Spanish STEAM Sessions (virtual career exposure sessions) for students at Bostonia Global Academy and Cajon Valley Union School District.Story continues""With the launch of iLatinx one year ago, we truthfully felt new and unprepared. We weren't sure what the year would hold or what we could accomplish. But you get a few people together who are determined to make a difference and impact on the community, and the opportunities are endless,"" Crew said. She adds that several opportunities for community engagement and volunteer work presented themselves to employees once iLatinx was formed, and that partnering with local nonprofits and schools has been extremely rewarding for iLatinx members.""The Barrio Logan STEAM Block Party was so beautifully orchestrated, and the best part was we brought the event to the community. You could see the excitement and wonder in the children's eyes, being exposed to things they hadn't yet seen before,"" Crew said. ""I myself am not an engineer or a scientist-by trade I plan events-I help foster these connections and experiences. When you create a lasting experience for a child, and see that spark of connection, there is something spectacular about it that trumps your everyday corporate event.""Erica Gonzalez, iLatinx's operations chair and administrative partner of global supply chain and global facilities at Illumina, said being a part of the group not only gives her a strong sense of community and belonging at work, but having the opportunity to expose young students to science careers has been one of the highlights since she joined the group.""It is truly an honor to be a part of the iLatinx ERG. But the exciting part for me is how we aim to foster inclusivity and build community, both within Illumina and in the areas our employees live and work. Partnering on the Girls Who Lead event was a top highlight of my first year with iLatinx,"" she said. ""It was wonderful seeing the engagement between the students who visited our headquarters and our employee volunteers who spoke of their experiences as women in STEM. It is these types of collaborations and community work that, for me, are so fulfilling on a personal and professional level.To learn more about Illumina's commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging, click here.Illumina, Friday, October 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719472/How-Illuminas-Newest-Employee-Resource-Group-iLatinx-Supports-Employees-and-Advocates-for-Diversity-in-Life-Science]"

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMAA is experiencing a favorable estimate revision trend. Estimates for the third quarter and current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share have moved north marginally over the past two months. Projected FFO per share growth rates for the third quarter and 2022 are 17.4% and 18.1%, respectively.Factors That Make Mid-America Apartment a Solid PickSunbelt-Focused Portfolio: MAA’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. Encouragingly, MAA’s portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown.The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets, as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable trends are increasing the desirability of its markets and boosting demand for rental units. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenue growth.Expansion Efforts: This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $175 to $225 million and acquisitions of $75 to 125 million for 2022. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.Amid a competitive pricing environment for acquisitions and the growing demand for apartment housing across its Sunbelt markets, the company’s focus on its development pipeline is a strategic fit.Redevelopment &amp; Technology Initiatives: MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations.The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base. Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.Balance Sheet Strength: MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. It generated 95.1% unencumbered NOI in the second quarter of 2022, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 22.97% growth expected for the industry. In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity is 10.01% compared with the industry’s average of 5.52%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.  Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In May 2022, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.25 per share, marking a 15% hike over the prior payment.Moreover, in December 2021, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.0875 per share. This marked a 6.1% sequential hike and the 12th consecutive annual increase in the company’s dividend. Looking at the company’s FFO growth projections and its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome key picks from the REIT sector include Equity Residential EQR and BRT Apartments BRT.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equity Residential’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past week to $3.52. EQR carries a Zacks Rank #2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRT Apartments’ 2022 FFO per share has moved 5.8% upward in the past two months to $1.63.

BloombergSen Investment Partners is a Canadian hedge fund that is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. The firm was set up by Mr. Jonathan Bloomberg in 2008, and it is a privately-held company.Mr. Bloomberg has decades of experience working in the financial industry. He completed his bachelor's degree in economics from Tufts University in 1996. Immediately after graduating, the executive embarked on his decades long career in the financial world, by starting work as an analyst at the firm Salomon Smith Barney, focusing on mergers and acquisitions and high yield initial and secondary public offerings. He would go on to work at the firm for two years, leaving the role in 1998. A year later he would then decide to expand his education and secure admission at the illustrious Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania for his Master's in Business Administration.The MBA would prove to be fruitful, as immediately after graduating, Mr. Bloomberg would head on to become a vice president of Burgundy Asset Management, an independent asset management firm also based in Canada. At this fund, the executive worked for its small and medium business funds for both Canadian and American companies. After leaving Burgundy in 2007, the now hedge fund executive set up BloomberSen a couple of months later in February 2008.BloombergSen describes itself as a long term, value investor. Through this, the firm evaluates its investment decisions over the course of five to ten years, as opposed to monthly or annually evaluating them like some of its other peers. This also provides it with tax benefits and low costs as the investments remain in its portfolio for a longer time period. Additionally, the firms that it chooses to invest in often have stable revenue, strong market positions, and low competition - which then ends up benefitting the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation process through lower volatility. A DCF model projects a company's cash flow into the future and adjusts it with the cost of capital and debt to wager a guess at the current true value to determine whether the market share price is under or overvalued.Story continuesAdditionally, the hedge fund does not open its doors to anyone, and if someone is looking to invest with BloombergSen, then a minimum investment of $2 million is required. It also selects only those firms whose shares are significantly undervalued on the public stock market, which then ensures that the portfolio as a whole is protected from both economic downturns and other volatility factors.By the end of this year's second quarter, BloombergSen had a portfolio that was worth $1.6 billion. In this portfolio, some top firms that are well known globally are W. R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB), Aon plc (NYSE:AON), and Colliers International Group Inc.

Revenue increased by 13% as Search proved resilient, primarily led by strength in the travel and retail verticals. YouTube advertising growth was lighter and moderated due to a tough comparison period and a general softening in brand advertising spend. That said, YouTube’s user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company’s overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency.

This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This chipmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1.89%.For the most recent quarter, Skyworks was expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share, but it reported $2.44 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.39%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.62 per share, while it actually produced $2.63 per share, a surprise of 0.38%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Skyworks, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Skyworks currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.11%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

We believe significant and substantive action is required to support athletes and transform hockey for future generations.""(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Toby Davis)]"

(NYSE:NKE) is the largest footwear and athletic apparel company in the U.S. with approximately $49 billion in global revenue.Under the Nike Jumpman trademark, the company provides athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories. It also sells shoes and clothing under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell brands. In addition, Nike offers sporting equipment and accessories such as bags, balls, eyewear, bats, gloves and other protective equipment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKEThe company sells its goods through a variety of channels and outlets, including footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores and its own branded Nike stores. It is found at the top of the list of the world's more recognizable and value brands.Founded as Blue Ribbon Sports in 1964, the company changed its name to Nike in 1971. It currently has a market capitalization of $143 billion.Financial reviewIn late September, Nike reported its fiscal first-quarter 2023 results for the period ended Aug. 31.Revenue increased 10% on a constant currency basis, with strength in direct sales at 14% constant currency growth. Nike brand digital sales increased 23%. Gross margins decreased 2.2% to 44.3% as has been common in corporate America recently, in this case due to elevated freight and logistics costs. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were 93 cents, down 20% from the prior-year period.Nike Is Facing ChallengesOne of the stunning notes in the release was the comment on inventories, which increased 44% to $9.7 billion. This was driven by elevated in-transit inventories from ongoing supply chain volatility.Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $11.9 billion, which decreased approximately $1.8 billion from last year as free cash flow was offset by stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends. Total debt was $9.4 billion and operating lease liabilities were $2.7 billion.Story continuesNike Is Facing ChallengesThe company generates significant amounts of free cash flow most years, ranging from $4 billion to $6 billion. Dividend payments totaled $480 million and share repurchases totaled $1 billion for the quarter. However, buying back that many shares with the company's elevated valuation levels may not be the best use of corporate capital.ValuationConsensus analyst earnings per share estimates are $2.98 for the fiscal year ending May 2023 and $3.78 for the following year. Giving it the benefit of using next year's more normalized earnings, Nike's stock trades at 23 times forward-looking earnings. The forward enterprise value/Ebitda ratio is approximately 15. Management expects gross margins to decline between 2% and 2.50% in 2023.The GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator creates a value of $67, or roughly 30% below today's price. Inputs used were next year's earnings per share estimate of $3.78 and a 10% long-term growth rate.The company pays an annualized dividend of $1.22, which creates a dividend yield of 1.35%.Guru tradesGurus who have purchased Nike stock recently include Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), George Soros (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), while Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) reduced his holding.ConclusionWith one of the most recognizable logos in the world, Nike is truly a global company with a dedicated fan base. However, margins and continued growth are both facing headwinds. Sales to China, a critical component to overall growth, fell 13% last quarter. The excess inventory issue will continue to create operating margin headwinds for the foreseeable future.The stocks excessively high valuation multiples do not create a margin of safety at this time when considering the multiple global and operating risks the company is facing. A lower entry point for investors is probably warranted, perhaps with a price-earnings ratio in the mid-teens range.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

153,06a5a50a-ffd3-3685-9e84-36d440e3510d,NKE,2022-10-08,Why Is the Market So Down on Big Bank Stocks?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-market-down-big-bank-174305902.html,1665164585,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'C', 'JPM', 'FDX', 'NKE']","[The big bank stocks have been laggards in the ongoing market pullback, though the Finance sector as a whole has held up relatively well on the back of strength in the insurance and regional bank spaces.It will be interesting to see if the group’s stock market fortunes will change in any way as JPMorgan JPM and Citigroup C kick-start the Q3 reporting cycle for the group on Friday, October 14th.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of JPMorgan (blue line; down -31.7%) and Citigroup (green line; -28.7%), relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (red line; -22.1%), the Zacks Finance sector (orange line; -20.3%) and the Zacks Tech sector (purple line; -33.2%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, JPMorgan shares are practically neck-to-neck with the Tech sector in the year-to-date period.The performance variance between JPMorgan and Citigroup this year, while not much, is nevertheless likely a function of the latter’s persistent earlier underperformance that Citigroup’s new management has been trying to account for through a strategic restructuring and repositioning.Bank Earnings ExpectationsWith respect to current earnings expectations for the group, Q3 earnings for the Zacks Finance sector are expected to be down -9.9% on +2.6% higher revenues. For the Zacks Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan and Citigroup are a part, Q3 earnings are expected to be roughly a fifth below the year-earlier level on +5.8% higher revenues.The table below shows the Zacks Finance sector’s 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the aggregate as well as at the constituent medium industry level.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor JPMorgan, Q3 earnings are expected to be -25.3% below the year-earlier level on +8.5% higher revenues, while the same for Citigroup are currently expected to change -42.2% and +7.6% respectively on a year-over-year basis.The primary reason for the big year-over-year decline in Q3 earnings for the banks is the very high level of reserve releases in the year-earlier period.Story continuesYou would recall that the banks had booked significant reserves or provisions for loan losses as the pandemic took hold, which they subsequently released. Booking reserves is a direct hit to earnings and its subsequent release boosts profitability. This makes year-over-year comparisons somewhat misleading.Most analysts look at bank profitability yon a so-called ‘pre-provision’ basis, which strips out the impact of such reserves. If we looked at bank profitability for 2022 Q3 on such a ‘pre-provision’ basis, they are essentially flat from the year-earlier level.If we look at a money-center bank like JPMorgan, we find that the commercial banking business is actually doing very well, with improved margins and modestly higher loan volumes offsetting weakness in the mortgage business and rising expenses. We know from Fed data that loan growth in the aggregate was up nicely in Q3, with credit card outlays particularly strong. In fact, other than home equity loans, all other loan categories should be up in the high single digits range in Q3.The positive revenue growth expected for JPM is reflective of the expected strong net interest income, a direct function of expanded margins and bigger loan volumes.On the capital markets side, the investment banking business is down significantly from the year-earlier level, perhaps by as much as -50%, with both M&amp;A and capital raising activities materially down. On the trading front, we are up against record volumes from the year-earlier level. But overall trading volumes, in the aggregate for the group as a whole, should essentially be flat from the year-earlier level. That said, there will be variations among the players, with some like JPMorgan modestly up from the year-earlier level, and others like Citi modestly down.Why the Downbeat Sentiment on Big Bank Stocks?Given the cyclical orientation of the banking business, they remain vulnerable to the rising recession risks to the economy as a result of the Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening. We see this heightened risk in the unusual behavior of the treasury bond yield curve, with shorter dated instruments that are more aligned Fed policy yielding above longer-dated bonds.I wouldn’t repeat why yield curve inversions are scary things and why it’s useful for all of us to keep a close on the risk of such a development. But I do want to point out here that I am sympathetic to the view that the current yield curve and its signaling power about future economic growth may not be fully comparable to historical periods as a result of the Fed’s extraordinary QE policies since the global financial crisis.Irrespective of this plausible but otherwise minority view of the yield inversion, they are a net negative for growth outlook. This, coupled with elevated oil prices and the geopolitical uncertainty resulting from the Ukraine war appear to be weighing on bank stocks lately.The market fears that JPMorgan and its peers will make a lot of money in the run up to the start of the recession as a result of higher margins, but all of that will get offset by the inevitable deterioration in loan portfolios as recessionary forces take hold. That happens through ‘provisions for loan losses’ that banks will eventually need to book as recession becomes unavoidable.The Covid recession turned out to be a non-event on the provisions front, as they ended up releasing the reserves that they had booked earlier. But that was because of the extraordinary fiscal support from the government.The typical behavior in a recession is for the booked provisions to eventually get charged off (or written off), with the magnitude of the charge-offs a function of how bad or otherwise the recession is. The 2008 episode was particularly nasty in this respect, given how central housing was to that downturn.The market has likely ‘over-learnt’ that lesson, as the banking group’s fundamentals remain rock solid at present, thanks in large part to the regulatory changes implemented in the wake of the 2008 recession. As such, we don’t see a lot of fundamental support for the excessively negative sentiment on big bank stocks at present, even if we assume a ‘typical’ recession on the horizon.We see the bank stocks as attractively positioned currently on valuation grounds as well. The chart below shows the relative forward 12-month PE multiple for the Zacks Major Banks industry relative to the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAS you can see, the group is currently trading at 46% of the S&amp;P 500 multiple, which compares to a 15-year high of 125%, low of 40% and median of 67%. Other valuation metrics validate this view as well.  What to Expect from the Q3 Earnings Season after the Nike &amp; Micron Reports We have been skeptical of extrapolating from FedEx’s FDX downbeat quarterly numbers as we see a big part of the FedEx problems as company specific. But FedEx is hardly alone in pointing towards a cloudier horizon.We don’t typically associate Nike NKE with management and operational missteps, but we just heard them tell us of an inventory overhang that has negative implications for margins and profitability. Part of the +44% jump in Nike’s inventory is reportedly related to apparel whose movement through the company’s supply chain was affected by the logistical challenges.We don’t know the details, but it’s fair to assume that some part of the inventory buildup is related to softening demand. After all, the U.S. Fed’s ongoing tightening cycle is directed at crimping aggregate demand as a way to bring down inflationary pressures.Nike’s inventory problem validates what we heard from retailers in the Q2 reporting cycle. Chipmaker Micron MU is faced with a comparable issue that forced it to cut guidance and slash capex to bring chip supplies in alignment with market demand that has come down as a result of weakening PC, tablet and smartphone sales.We are starting to look at these early reports from FedEx, Nike, Micron and others for their fiscal periods ending in August as giving us a preview of what likely lies ahead as the banks kick-off the Q3 reporting cycle in about two weeks. For the record, we and other data vendors count these early reports as part of the Q3 earnings season.Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard The aforementioned JPMorgan and Citigroup results won’t be the first quarterly reports for the Q3 earnings season. In fact, we have already seen 20 S&amp;P 500 members report results in recent days for their respective fiscal periods ending in August. We count all of these August-quarter results as part of our September-quarter tally.For the 20 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +1% from the same period last year on +12.6% higher revenues, with 70% beating EPS estimates and 55% beating revenue estimates.Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 20 companies compares across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these 20 companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe are trying hard not to draw any conclusions here given how small the sample size of Q3 results is at this stage. But it’s hard to put a gloss on the fact that these 20 index members, some of whom are true bellwethers like FedEx and Nike, struggled to beat consensus estimates.In fact, you can see above that the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking the 5-year lows for this group of companies. Needless to add that it is hardly a reassuring start to the Q3 reporting cycle.The Earnings Big PictureTo get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2022 Q3 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +0.4% on +9% higher revenues.Don’t forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -6.2% from the same period last year.The chart below shows the comparable picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe +6.7% earnings growth expected for the index this year drops to +0.1% once the Energy sector’s contribution is excluded.The chart below shows how the aggregate bottom-up earnings total for 2023 on an ex-Energy basis has evolved lately.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What Will Q3 Earnings Season Tell Wall Street?  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study ANSYS'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for ANSYS How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ANSYS is:10% = US$458m ÷ US$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.ANSYS' Earnings Growth And 10% ROETo begin with, ANSYS seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining ANSYS' moderate 10% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ANSYS' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 25% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ANSS? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is ANSYS Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?ANSYS doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that ANSYS' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

To help address this gap, the Wells Fargo Foundation and Elevate, a climate justice nonprofit, have joined forces to provide Chicago residents with access to clean, low-cost energy and inclusive workforce development opportunities while helping to lower carbon emissions in underserved neighborhoods.The two-year project, which is supported by $3.15 million in grant funding from the Wells Fargo Foundation, will support the decarbonization of approximately 100 homes for people with lower incomes, including energy efficiency improvements and solar installation. In addition to reducing emissions, these home upgrades help families save money on utility costs and make their homes more comfortable and resilient to severe weather. The effort will also expand access to Elevate's Contractor Accelerator, which connects women and contractors of color with the training and resources needed to take on clean energy projects as a way to grow their business.""Under-resourced and low-income communities spend disproportionately more of their income toward energy bills and, at the same time, disproportionately bear the burden of environmental injustice and climate change,"" said Robyn Luhning, Chief Sustainability Officer at Wells Fargo. ""Elevate's approach aims to bring economic and health benefits to residents and can be a model for equitably addressing climate change impacts across the U.S. We look forward to sharing key learnings from Chicago to support building decarbonization efforts at the local, state and national level.""The grant was announced at the home of Katherine Parks in Chicago's Austin neighborhood where contractors have installed energy efficiency improvements and replaced all of the natural gas equipment with efficient electric versions that are compatible with solar energy. Parks said, ""My furnace wasn't working very well and I was looking to repair it, but I felt a little apprehensive about electrification in the beginning. Now, I'm so pleased with the upgrades."" Parks runs a small daycare out of her home, and these upgrades will help improve indoor air quality and make the space more comfortable for her and the children she cares for.Story continues""The Wells Fargo-Elevate initiative is multifaceted and comprehensive,"" said Elevate CEO Anne Evens. ""It will mean building decarbonization and energy retrofits for 100 units in select Chicago neighborhoods, the creation of new jobs for Black and brown contractors in Chicago, as well as vital support for research and communications to disseminate outcomes and findings,"" Evens said. ""This investment will allow us to address climate change and the disparities facing diverse communities in Chicago in this space as we provide solutions to develop clean, renewable sources of energy.""The Place-Based Decarbonization and Contractor Accelerator Initiative includes:Retrofitting services: Elevate staff complete property assessments to identify optimal decarbonization and electrification strategies, scopes of work, and estimated construction budgets. This phase also includes resident engagement and a focus on how homeowners can realize the full benefits of low-carbon technologies, such as:Weatherizing the home with efficient air sealing and insulation to reduce heating and cooling costs.Replacing natural gas or propane heating systems with high efficiency heat pumps that add cooling.Installing rooftop solar to generate on-site electricity and further lower energy costs.Skill development Contractor Accelerator: Elevate trains and supports 24 women and contractors of color to prepare them for building electrification projects. This process includes:Adjusting program topics and wraparound support to meet contractor needs.Providing access to advanced technical training and education in electrification to contractors to build their customer base.Connecting contractors to decarbonization projects and providing direct exposure to an emerging market.Research: Elevate uses baseline energy consumption to estimate the avoided carbon emissions resulting from the capital upgrades on behalf of the partnership. The team also tracks non-energy impacts, including improvements in health, utility bill stability, comfort, and more. Elevate also researches the shifting market demand for clean energy projects and approaches to mitigating barriers to entry for women and contractors of color.About Wells FargoWells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a leading financial services company that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses in the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment, and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth &amp; Investment Management.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has lost 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 points to a change of -19.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.11 indicates a change of +28.2% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Wells Fargo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $18.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.8%. The $72.93 billion and $79.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -6.5% and +9.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $17.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16%. EPS of $0.74 for the same period compares with $1.38 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.46 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.47%. The EPS surprise was -3.9%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to a report by S&amp;P Global, citing Bloomberg, the S&amp;P 500 companies that raised their dividends delivered a 12.7% return in 2020, compared with a 6.5% decline in the dividend cutters.The additional income earned through these dividends investments is beneficial for investors, especially in times of financial instability. This year, elite hedge funds are also growing bullish on high-dividend stocks as the market longs for yields due to growing inflation.

The report also mentioned that reinvested dividends significantly increased overall S&amp;P 500 returns from 1990 to 2020.In the third quarter of 2022, dividend payments increased by $17.7 billion, compared with $17.6 billion in the previous quarter. Moreover, for the 12 months ending September 2022, US common dividend increases were $86.7 billion, up 20.7% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”11. Broadcom Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”8. Pfizer Inc.

Its free cash flow stood at $7.4 billion, compared with $5.9 billion a quarter earlier. The company paid $4.5 billion in dividends to shareholders, which shows that its FCF is stable for shareholder returns. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend Stocks for Growth11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To BuyTop 10 REIT Stocks Under $10Disclosure.

However, he said that he would advise the present co-CIOs, Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, and the rest of the investment committee. As of the end of 2021, under Ray Dalio’s leadership, Bridgewater had returned $52.2 billion to clients since 1975, although returns in 2021 were just $5.7 billion on assets under management of $99.2 billion.For the last few years, Ray Dalio had been repeatedly saying that ""cash is trash"". However, he has now warmed up to the idea of holding US dollars and believes that it is an acceptable investment. In April 2020, he declared cash as basically worthless, given the near-zero interest rates and elevated money supply, which would lower the value of dollars. He tweeted on October 3: ""At existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutral – neither a very good or very bad deal. In other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.""Dalio predicts long-term interest rates of over 4.5%, which means rates might climb as per Dalio’s assumptions in the coming years. The $23.6 billion Bridgewater portfolio has a healthy mix of growth and value equities. Some of the best growth plays in Dalio’s fund include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc.

During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)10. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), a Chinese company operating an e-commerce platform, is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. The Bridgewater portfolio held 4.8 million shares of Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in Q2 2022, worth $297.5 million, representing 1.26% of the total securities. The stock has featured in Ray Dalio’s fund since Q2 2019. On September 2, Barclays analyst Jiong Shao raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $66 from $45 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The company posted ""surprisingly stronger than expected topline and gross margins"" in Q2, the analyst told investors.

(NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue to grow with such a team with a strong culture.”9.

His earnings previews are influenced by the ""interesting"" results from Evercore’s three different surveys on Hospital CapEx/Procedures, lab activity, and U.S. TAVR trends, the analyst noted. He has an Outperform rating and a $275 price target on Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) shares.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were long Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 49 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $789.4 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Becton, Dickinson, and Company (NYSE:BDX) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like medical equipment (medical device and laboratory supplier Becton Dickinson). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Pleasanton, California.

(NYSE:VEEV) with an Overweight rating and a $220 price target. The analyst is positive on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)’s ability to successfully address new services with its R&amp;D/Vault platform. The analyst added that he sees Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) as well positioned to boost its top line at 15% over the next few years at stable 40% EBIT margins, which are some of the highest in all HCIT and SaaS universes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), with 757,605  shares worth $150 million. Overall, 45 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of June 2022, up from 41 funds in the prior quarter. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is a ​​New York-based manufacturer and marketer of skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products worldwide.

(NYSE:EL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $303, up from $298. China's zero-Covid policy still impacts the company's business, but after the derating in the stock, these headwinds are now ""adequately reflected"" in the valuation, the analyst told investors. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the leading position holder in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), with approximately 6 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Overall, 46 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of June 2022. Here is what Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund has to say about The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold cosmetic producer Estée Lauder, which we bought last March. At the time, the market reflected a dire outlook for retail demand, especially tourist-related; however, we found its Chinese business attractive and admired its agility across social media and other digital channels. As the stock has appreciated, the resulting valuation now leaves no room for error, such as a potential shift of Chinese consumers’ tastes away from US brands.”6.

More merchants are likely to be added soon.The company intends to make the underlined option available for in-person purchases and to merchants outside the United States in 2023.Block, Inc. Price and Consensus Block, Inc. Price and ConsensusBlock, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Block, Inc. QuoteGrowing InitiativesThe latest move bodes well for Block’s growing efforts toward bolstering its presence in the booming BNPL market.Apart from the introduction of the monthly payment solution, the company recently launched Square’s first integration with Afterpay in Canada, which was only available in the United States and Australia.In addition, it recently unveiled Square’s integration with Clearpay (known as Afterpay outside of the U.K. and Europe) in the U.K.Afterpay recently teamed up with Sephora, an omni-retailer of beauty products, in a bid to offer the BNPL service to the latter’s customers.

If you want to see some more of the most valuable companies in history, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Companies In History.Many of the most valuable companies in history dominate their industries. Some of the most valuable companies in history dominated oil and gas. Some are leaders in information technology and computing. All of the companies created a lot of value for their shareholders.In terms of what creates the most valuable companies in history, the size of the country's economy that a company is from is a key component. If a company's parent country is a small country, it is harder for that company to reach the scale needed to be considered among the most valuable in history. If the company's parent country is a nation with a huge economy, on the other hand, there are likely more markets that have the scale to allow companies to grow to reach very valuable status.In the 16th century, the Dutch were the leading economic power. As things changed, the British became the leading economic power in the 18th and 19th century. As a result, some Dutch and British companies have made it to the list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.In the 20th century, the United States became the leading economic power. Immediately after World War II, the United States had around half the world's GDP and much of the world's wealth. With much of the world's wealth, many American companies had the capital necessary to expand overseas and gain substantial market share. With much of the world as potential markets, American companies can gain more revenue and potentially more profits. As a result of the dominance of the United States economically, many American companies make this list.Another factor that helps companies make it to the list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History is the era that they operate.In terms of eras, modern day companies are more likely to be more valuable given the growth in the global economy. Because economies have advanced so much over the past 100 years, the markets today are much larger than the markets 100 years ago. With globalization, modern day companies also have opportunities at a larger market.Story continuesThe emergence of technology has also created many valuable companies, some of which also make the list of the 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.With technology, companies can grow very quickly and potentially capture a monopoly on very valuable markets that many people use. Microsoft is one example with Windows. Given that technology may not cost all that much to produce after it's first created, some tech sectors can also have higher margins than other industries. With higher margins and larger markets, it can be easier for some tech companies to be considered very valuable.In terms of the composition of the 15 Most Valuable Companies In History, the majority are tech companies and many exist today.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History, we used peak market cap to rank the companies since some of the most valuable companies no longer exist today. Some have also fallen in market cap from their peaks. For companies that existed hundreds of years ago, we used subjective measures to rank them.For the peak market cap, we used data from Ycharts.15 Most Valuable Companies In History15.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the technology sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy Now.In spite of the Fed jacking up interest rates, the technology sector is continuing to attract investor attention in 2022. With rampant inflation still plaguing the market, the sector was expected to suffer from a loss in popularity. However, its cheaper valuation in a time of economic recession is managing to work in its favor. According to a Bloomberg article published this September, The Nasdaq 100 Index was 35% cheaper than its peak in 2020. Some of the best FAANG stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) still continued to rake in cash and maintain their earnings outlooks, inspiring confidence as far as investors were concerned.What are FAANG stocks?The acronym FAANG refers to the top five American technology companies in the market today: Facebook (now known as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). With Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) losing the favor of many investors with its performance this year, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is steadily becoming a new member of this group of stocks.Investors' approach to the markets this year has demonstrated that staying away from the best FAANG stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is not an option. The sheer size of the tech industry alone makes it the largest of its kind in the S&amp;P 500, making up almost 27% of the index. As a result, many investors are now being pulled towards durable businesses like the FAANG stocks.According to a Reuters article published this July, Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings results added to investor confidence in the tech sector, as they showed that the FAANG stocks were well-equipped to deal with a recession. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose by about 3.1% in July after the company mentioned it was targeting double-digit growth in fiscal revenue.Story continues11 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy NowLet's now take a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to buy now.Our MethodologyWe have selected renowned tech stocks that are comparable to the Big Tech companies.

Representatives of the non-profit organization point to a recent $50,000 grant from Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) as a way of expanding this success through initiatives that focus on low-income neighborhoods near MPC's refinery on Salt Lake City's west side.""A girl named Heba was so impacted by a trip to visit national parks that she went on to participate in a national parks conservation group and traveled to Washington, D.C., to advocate for the protection of our national parks,"" said NWSL Director of Community Initiatives and Marketing Jasmine Walton. ""Since then, she has graduated college and now works to empower other young people through her work at a refugee service agency.""The bulk of MPC's grant will support NWSL's YouthWorks program and Westside Leadership Institute, which have served almost 3,800 adults and teenagers since 1997. YouthWorks assists teenagers who are struggling academically and socially by providing weekly classes on life skills that will help them as they enter the workforce, such as budgeting, goal setting, resume writing and building healthy relationships. Participants also take part several days a week in neighborhood beautification projects that involve landscaping work and painting. The Westside Leadership Institute helps area residents learn how to organize as community groups to bring attention to neighborhood challenges and concerns in hopes of resolving them. Some of the institute's courses are taught by business leaders, local community members and professors from the University of Utah.Story continues""The Westside Leadership Institute offers courses throughout the year in both Spanish and English to help residents who want to gain skills that move the needle on issues they are passionate about,"" Walton said. ""West View Media was created by residents who attended one of our first fundamentals courses 17 years ago.

These annual, one-day volunteer efforts bring together hundreds of people to paint and clean up the residences of homeowners who are not physically or financially able to maintain their homes. For several years, employees from MPC's refinery have participated in Paint Your Heart Out, painting houses in neighborhoods around the facility. Since Paint Your Heart Out began in 1985, more than 820 Salt Lake City homes have been repainted.""Given the location of our refinery, we feel a strong connection to NWSL's core mission to create opportunity in this area of the city by preserving and revitalizing local neighborhoods,"" said MPC's Salt Lake City Refinery General Manager Eric Sjunnesen.

176,2ad4de29-29fa-39fb-8712-7645d86fa809,AES,2022-10-08,AES (AES) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aes-aes-top-dividend-stock-154503955.html,1665157503,STORY,['AESC'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.AES in FocusHeadquartered in Arlington, AES (AES) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 4.53% so far this year. The power company is paying out a dividend of $0.16 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.49% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.41% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.63 is up 4.7% from last year. AES has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.22%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. AES's current payout ratio is 42%. This means it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AES is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $1.61 per share, with earnings expected to increase 5.92% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AES is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A federal jury in California has awarded the hefty fine to the auto giant after the vehicle owners alleged that the company sold vehicles with defective engines and hid the fact from the customers.The lawsuit was brought by national plaintiffs’ trial firm, DiCello Levitt, on behalf of owners and lessees of GM trucks and SUVs sold during 2011-2014 in California, North Carolina and Idaho that were fitted with the company’s Generation IV Vortec 5300 LC9 engine. The faulty vehicles included some of its GMC Sierra, Yukon, Yukon XL and Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban and TahoeFiled in late 2016, it claimed that internal company documents showed that General Motors was alerted of a defect in the engine’s piston rings that resulted in excessive consumption of oil. The infiltrated parts of the engine led to damage and gradually, premature engine breakdown and failure in a significant number of GM’s 5.3-liter SUVs and light trucks.In 2010, the company recommended to its dealers the cleaning of the pistons of the affected vehicles. After that proved to be an ineffective solution, engineers suggested engine changes but those, implemented in 2011, once again did not solve the problem and the oil consumption issues persisted until the company stopped production of the engine following the 2014 model year.In the recent verdict, the jury awarded each of the 38,000 class members $2,700, bringing total damages to $102.6 million slapped on the company.Very few class action cases are brought to trial and it is an important legal milestone that the case has been given a verdict as opined by DiCello Levitt.General Motors, however, plans to seek post-trial relief and appeal further if the court allows the verdict to stand.The company has come under the scanner of late over safety issues. A while ago it recalled certain 2013-2015 Chevrolet Spark and 2014-2015 Chevrolet Spark EV vehicles, per a report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Association.The recall was an expansion of a 2014 campaign covering Spark and Spark EV models. The present scope covered nearly 121,000 vehicles because the hoods could fly open while driving due to corrosion in the latch pivot, increasing the risk of a crash.The affected models comprised 116,223 Chevrolet Spark built between September 2011 and September 2015 and another 4,465 Chevrolet Spark EVs built between August 2012 and November 2015.The recent verdict is a blotch in the performance of one of United States’ top-selling brands as it hoodwinked customers and compromised passenger safety.Shares of GM have lost 42.2% over the past year compared with its industry’s 21.2% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Lordstown Motors RIDE and Dorman Products DORM, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Lordstown has an expected earnings growth rate of 66.9% for the current year.

Earnings declined year over year while net sales increased. Management reaffirmed its fiscal 2022 guidance.The company’s sales performance reflects the strength of its broad global portfolio and the effective execution of its strategies despite a volatile operating environment. Its brand marketing investments, innovation and category management initiatives continue to drive growth. The company is on track to capitalize on a sustained shift to cooking more at home, higher digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating and trusted brands.During the third quarter, McCormick continued to battle supply chain-related hurdles. It incurred escalated costs to meet the high demand in some parts of the business. The company is on track to managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies in the supply chain.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of 69 cents per share declined from 80 cents in the year-ago quarter. The downside stemmed from reduced adjusted operating income. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents per share.This global leader in flavor generated sales of $1,595.6 million, up 3% year over year. Constant currency (cc) sales increased 6%, on 10% growth from pricing actions somewhat offset by a 1% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 1% drop from the exits of a low-margin business across India and the Consumer business in Russia as well as a 2% decline from all other volume and product mix. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,590.4 million.During the third quarter, cc sales increased at a three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, relative to a pre-pandemic baseline of 2019.McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated QuoteStory continues The company’s gross profit margin contracted 320 basis points to 35.5%, thanks to escalated cost inflation and other supply chain expenses. These were somewhat countered by cost savings from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program and pricing actions.Operating income was $235 million, down from $265 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by gross margin contraction mainly in the Flavor Solutions unit.Segment DetailsConsumer: Sales went up 1% to $927.9 million and cc sales increased 4%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. The upside can be attributed to growth in the Americas and Asia/Pacific regions with pricing actions fueling sales across all three regions. Consumer sales in the Americas increased by 3%. Consumer sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell by 13%. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific market increased 5%.Flavor Solutions: Sales in the segment increased 6% to $667.7 million.

Adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are likely to bear a 2% negative impact from currency movements.For fiscal 2022, net sales are expected to increase 2% from fiscal 2021 levels and rise 3-5% at cc. This includes an adverse impact from the sale of the company’s Kitchen Basics business. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions along with cost savings. These factors are likely to offset inflationary pressures over time. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.Adjusted operating income is likely to decline 13-11% (down 11-9% at cc). Management envisions adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.63-$2.68 in fiscal 2022. The company posted adjusted earnings of $3.05 per share in fiscal 2021. The guidance reflects an adverse impact of 2 cents from the sale of the Kitchen Basics business.The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s shares have dropped 11.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 4.8%.Some Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks are Lancaster Colony LANC, Hershey HSY and The J.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 14, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.1%.Revenues are expected to be $5.39 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.74% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc?For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc would post earnings of $3.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.42, delivering a surprise of +9.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, this week PNC launched a new career development and tuition benefit available to its employees nationwide.""With PartnerUp's expansion, we're working with more employers and local education partners to provide local high school graduates with the skills needed to land entry-level careers in high-demand industries like healthcare and financial services, without the burden of student loan debt,"" said Vicki Henn, PNC chief human resources officer. ""As a talent-focused company, we're committed to investing in impactful skills development programs and educational initiatives that help drive career growth and economic opportunity in the communities we serve.""Since PartnerUp's inception in 2018, PNC Bank has partnered with 30 schools and 16 employers to offer more than 6,000 high school students the opportunity to secure a more direct, debt-free route to in-demand careers. PNC's effort to extend the career development program to more high schoolers comes as employers across the country continue to grapple with worker shortages in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.""In today's labor market, it's more important than ever that employers challenge our thinking on the experiences and qualifications needed for available jobs, and our roles as leaders in developing talent,"" said Brianna McMeekin, PNC talent program manager. ""With this expansion into new markets, PartnerUp is giving more employers the opportunity to invest and build a pipeline of talent from local high schools, where we're creating content to match career education standards and offering real pathways to success for students, post-graduation.""PartnerUp's push into the Cleveland and Birmingham regions builds on the company's multi-year effort to develop a scalable career pathway program that could be replicated and deployed in additional communities across its footprint. Throughout the school year, the multi-session program offers students in-school curriculum and career development resources, such as resume writing, interview coaching and employer recruitment events to help prepare graduates to go straight into the workforce.Story continuesSince 2018, PNC Bank has offered more than 100 PartnerUp graduates diverse roles at the financial services company, and 87 have accepted and started their career paths with the company. Other graduates of the program have landed at partner companies.For Neylienid Quinones, a recent graduate of Cleveland's John Marshall School of Civic &amp; Business Leadership, the hands-on training, networking resources and career coaching offered through PartnerUp has turned into a life-changing opportunity. The 18-year-old recently landed an entry-level position with PNC's Talent Recruitment team, after successfully completing the program's curriculum. Quinones is one of more than 30 Cleveland Metropolitan School District seniors who received job offers from PNC or other employer partners participating in the PartnerUp program.""It was an eye opener,"" she said. ""I was looking for a job, but I wasn't expecting to get such a big job. I was working in fast food at the time and thinking I would try to go into retail. But instead, I had the opportunity to go from fast food to a career on my second job.""PartnerUp is one of two career development initiatives the company has invested in to help meet increased demand for skilled workers throughout its footprint. In partnership with Guild, PNC recently introduced an education benefit available to the company's 62,000 employees after 90 days of employment.The new benefit gives full-time and part-time employees access to a best-in-class education experience that includes a curated catalog of tuition-covered professional certificates, college prep courses, and associate and bachelor's degrees to help advance career mobility. Fully funded, partially funded and reimbursement options are available.""We're honored to partner with PNC to bring career opportunities to its workforce,"" said Natalie McCullough, Guild president and chief commercial officer.

(NASDAQ:ISRG). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$242 and falling to the lows of US$186. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuitive Surgical's current trading price of US$189 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Intuitive Surgical is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $279.12, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Intuitive Surgical’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Intuitive Surgical look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

Intuitive Surgical's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 61%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ISRG is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ISRG for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ISRG.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 2.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.06%.Coming into today, shares of the discount retailer had lost 4.36% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 3.15%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.08%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Ross Stores as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Ross Stores is projected to report earnings of $0.80 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 26.61%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.36 billion, down 4.77% from the year-ago period.ROST's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.99 per share and revenue of $18.15 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -18.07% and -4.07%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Ross Stores. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at Amphenol's (NYSE:APH) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Amphenol is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$2.4b ÷ (US$15b - US$2.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Amphenol has an ROCE of 19%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 12% generated by the Electronic industry. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol roceIn the above chart we have measured Amphenol's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 66% in that time. 19% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amphenol has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Our Take On Amphenol's ROCETo sum it up, Amphenol has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 73% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Amphenol  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

On that day, Marathon Oil is projected to report earnings of $1.23 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 215.38%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.13 billion, up 46.51% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.75 per share and revenue of $8.29 billion, which would represent changes of +202.55% and +51.61%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Investors have been on quite a roller coaster ride here. So let's kick it off with some of the biggest moves that we've seen play out in the markets. Let's start with the chip stocks because it has been a rude awakening for investors who thought that the sector may have bottomed. Signs of slowing demand and supply chain issues have some worried about a prolonged downturn.You can see the Semiconductor Index moving to the downside here on the five-day chart. Samsung reported a 32% dive in operating income. AMD lowered its revenue guidance for the third quarter. That was enough to drag down some of its competitors. Intel and Nvidia both moving to the downside. You can see the move over the last 48 hours or so.Also part of this are regulations from the Biden administration, clamping down on China's access to chip technology with new export rules. AMD dropping 14% today, the biggest drop that we have seen in this stock since March 2020, closing the week at 58.44.Next up, let's talk about Twitter, this stock up just about 12% over the past five days, a revived chance of Elon Musk's takeover. But this deal is very far from being over. They now seem to have stalled, in part over a debt financing contingency. This is according to reports. Yesterday, a Delaware judge granted Musk's request to delay his trial with Twitter, giving both sides until October 28 to complete the deal. Over the past five days, you can see it up just about 12%, closing at 49.18, so below that deal price that Musk initially wanted to pay for Twitter at 54.20 a share.Let's talk about oil, recording the biggest weekly rally that we have seen since March, as worries over supply offset some of those demand concerns. On the supply side, OPEC+ announcing its biggest output cut since the start of the pandemic, the move coming ahead of the impending European sanctions on Russian oil imports. It's a massive reversal from what we've seen in crude as of late. Over the past three months, you can see crude off just over 10%, coming off the worst quarter that we have seen since 2020, but really rallying on the news that we got this week.Let's round it out with Peloton, the stock surging more than 20%. Two big announcements-- we started off the week with a partnership with Hilton. And then we heard about another round of cuts. CEO Larry Barry McCarthy announcing plans to cut about 12% of the workforce, its fourth round of layoffs this year, saying, quote, ""He needs to do it to save the company.""One of the ways that they're trying to save the company and increase business is through new partnerships. The agreement with Hilton will put its bikes in 5,400 Hilton-owned hotels throughout the US. You can see Peloton moving to the upside for the past five days, up just around 25%. You can see it did close the day in negative territory, but for the week, closing at $8.69 a share.]"

If you want to see some more of the most valuable companies in history, go directly to 5 Most Valuable Companies In History.Many of the most valuable companies in history dominate their industries. Some of the most valuable companies in history dominated oil and gas. Some are leaders in information technology and computing. All of the companies created a lot of value for their shareholders.In terms of what creates the most valuable companies in history, the size of the country's economy that a company is from is a key component. If a company's parent country is a small country, it is harder for that company to reach the scale needed to be considered among the most valuable in history. If the company's parent country is a nation with a huge economy, on the other hand, there are likely more markets that have the scale to allow companies to grow to reach very valuable status.In the 16th century, the Dutch were the leading economic power. As things changed, the British became the leading economic power in the 18th and 19th century. As a result, some Dutch and British companies have made it to the list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.In the 20th century, the United States became the leading economic power. Immediately after World War II, the United States had around half the world's GDP and much of the world's wealth. With much of the world's wealth, many American companies had the capital necessary to expand overseas and gain substantial market share. With much of the world as potential markets, American companies can gain more revenue and potentially more profits. As a result of the dominance of the United States economically, many American companies make this list.Another factor that helps companies make it to the list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History is the era that they operate.In terms of eras, modern day companies are more likely to be more valuable given the growth in the global economy. Because economies have advanced so much over the past 100 years, the markets today are much larger than the markets 100 years ago. With globalization, modern day companies also have opportunities at a larger market.Story continuesThe emergence of technology has also created many valuable companies, some of which also make the list of the 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.With technology, companies can grow very quickly and potentially capture a monopoly on very valuable markets that many people use. Microsoft is one example with Windows. Given that technology may not cost all that much to produce after it's first created, some tech sectors can also have higher margins than other industries. With higher margins and larger markets, it can be easier for some tech companies to be considered very valuable.In terms of the composition of the 15 Most Valuable Companies In History, the majority are tech companies and many exist today.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History, we used peak market cap to rank the companies since some of the most valuable companies no longer exist today. Some have also fallen in market cap from their peaks. For companies that existed hundreds of years ago, we used subjective measures to rank them.For the peak market cap, we used data from Ycharts.15 Most Valuable Companies In History15. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Peak Market Capitalization: $834.40 billionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader in GPUs which is in some ways better suited for some AI applications than traditional CPUs. Given the huge anticipated growth in AI, investors sent NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a peak market capitalization of over $830 billion before the stock eventually fell to its current valuation of around $300 billion.If the company maintains its lead in the AI chip market, however, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could have upside. In terms of hedge funds, Fisher Asset Management was one of the top hedge fund holders with a holding of almost 7.6 million shares at the end of Q2.14. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Peak Market Capitalization: $858.50 billionGiven its market share in e-commerce and the cloud in China, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) achieved a peak market capitalization of over $850 billion before its stock fell due to the Chinese government beginning to reign in the tech giants in the nation. With China's economy weaker and the broader weakness in the market, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has a market capitalization of around $220 billion. There is a chance that Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stock could be delisted if China and the United States can't agree on accounting terms.13. PetroChinaPeak Market Capitalization:$1 trillionPetroChina achieved the $1 trillion mark briefly when it debuted in 2007. As a result, PetroChina became the first company to break through the $1 trillion mark. Since its IPO, however, PetroChina stock hasn't done very well and the company actually withdrew its listing on the NYSE.12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Peak Market Capitalization: $1 trillionInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was worth $258.6 billion in 1967, which assuming the growth in the stock market, could easily be considered worth $1 trillion or even more today. As a result, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is ranked #12 on our list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.Back then International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of the most dominant mainframe computing companies with substantial market share.Today, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is overshadowed by bigger companies in computing but still has potential upside if the economy doesn't slow as much as expected.11. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Peak Market Capitalization: $1.078 trillionAt its peak, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was worth $1.078 trillion as the market anticipated substantial future earnings growth from the company given its billions of daily users and many different ways of monetizing those users.Given competition from TikTok as well as the worsening economy, however, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is worth around $375 billion as of October 7.There is potential upside in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) if it can maintain its user base and grow earnings. Although the market isn't very optimistic about the metaverse, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could also benefit if the metaverse does become a huge market as CEO Mark Zuckerberg expects. Renaissance Technologies owned almost 5.5 million shares at the end of Q2.10. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Peak Market Capitalization: $1.239 trillionAlthough it isn't the largest auto maker in the world, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) achieved the highest peak market capitalization of all auto makers with a peak value of $1.239 trillion. With a market capitalization of over $750 billion as of October 7, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still by the most valuable car company in the world.As the electric vehicle leader, investors expect substantial earnings growth in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s future. Given its CEO in Elon Musk, many expect Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be among the leaders in autonomous driving. ARK Investment Management was one of the top holders of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of the second quarter.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Peak Market Capitalization: $1.888 trillionAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been one of the best growth stocks over the last twenty years. As a result of its growth, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has achieved the number one position in both e-commerce and the cloud, both of which are huge markets. With its positions, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) achieved a peak market capitalization of $1.888 trillion. That ranks the company as #9 on our list of 15 Most Valuable Companies In History.Although its market cap is around $1.25 trillion as of October 7, the stock could still have upside if it continues its earnings growth.8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Peak Market Capitalization: $2.001 trillionAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also been one of the best growth stocks since its IPO in 2004. Thanks to its leading market share in search and also its smart acquisition of YouTube, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has become one of the most profitable companies in the world. As one of the world's leading tech giants, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also achieved a peak market cap of $2 trillion. TCI Fund Management owned almost 2.5 million shares at the end of Q2.7. Saudi AramcoPeak Market Capitalization: $2.43 trillion.Saudi Aramco is the world's biggest oil company and also the leading company in Saudi Arabia.

Meanwhile, the world's top maker of memory chips, AMD and Samsung, are sparking fears that a slump in semiconductor demand could be much worse than expected.Let's bring in Vivek Arya, Bank of America senior semiconductor analyst to take a look at all of this. So Vivek, welcome back to the show. What should we take from this? When we look at some of the chipmakers that are down the most year-to-date, led by NVIDIA, what is it that concerns you about the trend you're seeing right now?VIVEK ARYA: Yeah, thank you very much for having me. I think the semiconductor industry is one that makes us feel very profitable and productive for three years in a row, and then just makes us feel awful in that fourth year. And it seems like we are in that fourth year. The specific things that are causing the headwinds this year are threefold.First, there is just enormous pressure on the consumer because of all the inflationary issues, because of all the turmoil in Europe, because of the lockdowns in China. Secondly, we have the specter of rising rates, which is never good for valuations in high beta, high multiple sector. And then on top of it, as you mentioned, there are some additional restrictions on semiconductor companies in terms of shipping to China.And look, China is the largest customer for semiconductors, then it's never good to have friction between the largest designer of semis, which is the US, and the largest customer. So I think where we are today, when I put it all in the context, is the semiconductor stocks have a way of smelling the turn in the economy 6 to 9 to 12 months before it happens.So last November when semiconductor stocks peaked, there was no talk of recession. The same way, there is no talk of an upturn or the next cycle today. So our assumption is that compare stock to get easier for the sector next year. And if that is the assumption, and if that's the right assumption, we think semiconductor stocks can try and find a bottom sometime in Q4. And meanwhile, the valuations are starting to look very interesting for what is a very profitable industry.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: So Vivek, that's interesting just in terms of what you said to export restrictions, and then taking that in coupling that with your predictions here, your expectations for this space going into 2023. So it sounds like you view it as a challenge here in the near term, but you don't think it's going to have a significant impact in terms of sales. Is that right?VIVEK ARYA: Yeah. So let's talk about those restrictions. So first of all, as I mentioned, friction is never good between the largest designer and the largest buyer of semiconductors. But when you take a step back, the majority of chips that are shipped to China are actually for a lot of consumer applications.They are for smartphones, they are for PCs, they are for a lot of low end consumers, speakers, and so forth. Like the largest buyers of semis in China are not supercomputing or military companies. They are companies like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE. So it's not really supercomputing.In fact, if I take the entire supercomputing and military end use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5% or 10% of in demand. And even if you assume half of it is in China, which is a very big number, it still says that there is not more than a 5% or so headwind.Second point I would mention is that we have to be careful when we use the term restriction. So what is happening is that there is a set of rules that now forces a lot of semiconductor companies to first go and ask for approvals. So they are not actually banned outright from shipping. They have been given this extra step to go and verify that the end customer is not a military end use customer or a supercomputing customer that might be on an entity list.Which is why we think that, yes, it's a headwind and it doesn't help when the sector is already facing a lot of the macro pressures. But in terms of specifically this incremental headwind, we don't think it's more than 5% to 7% incremental. And that, it's only apply to very specific set of companies.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Vivek, I want to draw your attention to something that we saw from Truist Securities in talking about Tesla perhaps being a dark horse when it comes to AI and perhaps a rival for NVIDIA, saying that they actually see it-- obviously, though, NVIDIA is the leader in this space. They see a path for Tesla to build its own business to compete with it. What's your take on perhaps the role that some of these non-traditional chipmakers like Tesla might play in this space?VIVEK ARYA: Sure. Absolutely. Look, first, when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence, we are still in the first innings. You know, that means if I take all the servers that were shipped in the world in the last year, less than 15% of them actually had an AI accelerator in them. And the majority of them used an NVIDIA product.And then if I couple that with the automotive industry, where Tesla participates, the entire automotive industry is only 8% of the semiconductor market. So I think we have to keep a lot of these things in context of what the sizes of these markets are.So we really like NVIDIA. And the reason is that their specific technology of AI accelerators, it's not just a chip. They're not just designing a chip. They're actually designing a complete end-to-end system and a stack of software and a big number of developers, 3 and 1/2 million developers that have been trained on using this product.So I would say that Tesla use case is a very, very specific one, maybe less than 1% of the entire semiconductor industry. But it is a rising tide, many companies will participate, but we think NVIDIA is on a different-- not say different planet, but I think in a different solar system when it comes to the application and the benefits of AI.SEANA SMITH: Vivek Arya, always great to get your perspective of Bank of America. Thanks so much for joining us today.VIVEK ARYA: Thank you.]"

American semiconductor equipment makers Lam Research Corp, Applied Materials Inc and KLA Corp were all down more than 4%.Applied Materials said it was assessing the new rules, while Lam and KLA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc said on Friday it would seek a license under new U.S. export control rules for equipment to keep operating its factories in China.American officials on Friday published a sweeping set of rules that restrict the export of some U.S.-made semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, but provided exemptions for companies from the United States and its allies to seek a license.""SK Hynix is ready to make its utmost efforts to get the U.S. government's license and will closely work with the Korean government for this,"" the company said in a statement. ""We're also ready to operate our fabrication plants in China smoothly, while complying with the international order.""Officials on Friday also introduced rules against selling a broad swath of chips for any use in ""supercomputer"" systems in China. Supercomputers can be used in developing nuclear weapons and other military technologies. U.S. companies Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc both said last month they had been told to stop exporting their top-tier chips to China.The rules define a supercomputer as any system with 100 or more petaflops of so-called double precision computing power, or 200-plus petaflops of single precision computing power, within a 41,600 cubic feet area. A petaflop is a measure of a computer's processing speed.Story continuesNvidia, which said last month the rules could affect $400 million of its current-quarter sales in China, said Friday it did not expect any further impact on its business.""These regulations impose on the broader industry controls on processors meeting certain thresholds that we were already subject to. We don't expect the new controls, including restrictions on sales for highly dense systems, to have a material impact on our business,"" the company said in a statement.AMD did not respond to a request for comment.

Strong growth prospects in emerging economies and strong solvency and capital structure are added benefits.Critical Care sales were up 2.7% on an underlying basis in the second quarter of 2022. The revenue uptick resulted from the increased uptake of the company's Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) algorithm and broad portfolio of sensors. Further, the company continued enrollment in the HPI Smart BP trial that focused on generating additional clinical evidence to support further adoption. The company also continued to see robust demand for the HemoSphere monitoring platform with a healthy pipeline.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteEdwards Lifesciences expects full-year 2022 underlying sales growth in the mid-single-digit range on the back of strength in demand for products used in more intense surgeries.In the second quarter, Edwards Lifesciences’ Surgical Structural Heart sales improved 1.6% on an underlying basis, banking on increased penetration of premium RESILIA products. The company delivered impressive global growth amid headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain non-core cannula products and the COVID-related shutdown in China.In March 2022, the company got FDA approval and subsequent commercial launch of the MITRIS RESILIA valve, which adds to the portfolio of durable RESILIA tissue products with a valve designed for the heart's mitral position. The MITRIS valve builds on the commercial success of the INSPIRIS aortic valve while providing intuitive product features as well as the benefits of the innovative RESILIA tissue technology.Story continuesSo far, the physician feedback for MITRIS has been positive and initial clinical outcomes have been favorable. In the second quarter, the company continued to expand the overall body evidence that supports Edwards RESILIA tissue valves. In May 2022, the company presented results from a commenced trial sub-analysis at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons, which demonstrated the excellent performance of this tissue technology in treating bicuspid aortic valve disease.Edwards Lifesciences expects underlying sales growth for 2022 in the mid-single-digit range, driven by market growth and the adoption of premium technologies.On the flip side, Edwards Lifesciences’ revenues for the second quarter missed the consensus mark. U.S. TAVR sales were impacted by a slower-than-expected improvement in hospital staffing and temporary contrast agent shortages. The company’s research and development expenditures were up 11.3% year over year. This increase was driven by continued investments in the company's transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9.2% year over year, driven by the resumption of in-person commercial activities. These developments drove operating costs by 10%, building pressure on the company’s bottom line.The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and COVID-related hospital staffing issues are concerning. The company has lowered its sales outlook for full-year 2022, taking these macroeconomic challenges into account.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Abiomed ABMD.

VEEV is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by a slew of strategic deals inked over the past few months. A robust first-half fiscal 2023 performance, along with a strong product portfolio, is expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and forex woes persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 32% compared with a 53.2% decline of the industry and 21.3% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of cloud-based software applications and data solutions for the life sciences industry has a market capitalization of $26.77 billion. The company projects 16.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 5.5% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals to Drive Growth: Veeva Systems has entered into a slew of partnerships over the past few months, raising our optimism. In June, the company announced a collaboration with ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to define and operationalize data-driven commercial strategies for the latter’s new Rare Disease business unit.In April, Veeva Systems announced that it had expanded its partnership with LEO Pharma to drive relevant discussions within the scientific community using Veeva Link for Key People.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Veeva Systems’ robust product suite, which includes unique solutions like Veeva Vault, Veeva CRM, Veeva Network and Veeva OpenData. The company also announced mobile innovations in the Veeva CRM platform, which provides information to field teams from any device.Veeva Systems, in June, unveiled a new study training application — Veeva Vault Study. Another new cloud application of the company is Veeva Vault Training. Veeva Systems also announced its intent to build Veeva MedTech CRM on the Vault Platform to meet the need for a deep, industry-specific solution.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Veeva Systems’ solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. Both its segments performed impressively during the quarter. The company continues to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Commercial Cloud’s continued strength looks impressive. Expansion of gross margin also bodes well.DownsidesForex Woes: Veeva Systems derives a major share of its revenues from international operations. Some of its international agreements provide for payment denominated in local currencies and the majority of its local costs are also denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact its operating results when converted into U.S. dollars.Stiff Competition:Veeva Systems operates in a highly competitive market. In new sales cycles within the company’s largest product categories, it competes with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications for the life sciences industry. The company’s Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client-server-based legacy solutions offered by large companies and other smaller application providers.Veeva Systems Inc.

However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.5%. The first quarter was the 121st quarter out of the past 127 quarters for which Neogen reported a year-over-year revenue increase.Segments in DetailThe company registered Food Safety revenues of $67.6 million in the first quarter, indicating 3% (up 9% at constant exchange rate or CER) year-over-year growth. The upside was driven by a 25% increase in aflatoxin test kits, primarily due to an aflatoxin outbreak in Brazil and new business in Mexico and Central America.Animal Safety revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $67.7 million, up 3% (up 4% at CER) year over year. The upside can be attributed to 21% growth in sales of animal care products, including supplements, vitamin injectables, and companion animal parasiticides, enhanced by the acquisition of CAPInnoVet in September 2021.Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNeogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNeogen Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Neogen Corporation QuoteRevenues from Neogen’s animal genomics business increased 7% on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal first quarter. Sales from the company’s December 2021 acquisition of Genetic Veterinary Sciences were partially offset by lower sample volumes in the porcine market and a difficult prior-year comparison due to a large research project.International revenues increased 2% year over year (up 10% at CER), representing 39.1% of overall sales of Neogen in the reported quarter.The company’s U.K. business increased 19% in pounds during the fiscal year, led by a 31% increase in sales of cleaners and disinfectants. Brazil revenues increased 14% in Brazilian reals, driven by strong sales of the company’s mycotoxin test kits, including aflatoxin and deoxynivalenol (DON), as well as increases in veterinary instruments and genomics testing.Latin America revenues rose 20% in Mexican pesos, led by increases across the company’s diagnostic testing portfolio and culture media, as well as higher sales of rodent control products and cleaners and disinfectants.Story continuesNeogen’s revenues from China were down 14%in Chinese yuan compared to the previous fiscal year, attributable to the country's COVID-19 lockdowns in the second half of fiscal 2022. Neogen’s Australasia revenues declined 2% in local currency as a large culture media order in the prior year was partially offset by bovine genomic service increases.Margin DetailsNeogen’s fiscal first-quarter gross profit increased 3.8% year over year to $62.3 million. The gross margin expanded 28 basis points (bps) to 47.1%.Sales and marketing expenses rose 13.8% to $23.4 million, whereas administrative expenses rose 108.8% from the prior-year quarter to $27.9 million. Research &amp; development expenses were $4.9 million, up 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. Operating costs totaled $56.2 million, up 46.9% year over year.In the reported quarter, operating income was $6.1 million, down 72.1% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Operating margin contracted 1237 bps to 4.6%.Cash PositionThe company exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and investments of $374.7 million, down from $381.1 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. The company had no debt on the balance sheet at quarter-end.Our TakeNeogen exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 on a mixed note with better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenues.The company recorded sales growth across the Food Safety and Animal Safety segments. Barring Australia and China, solid international operations also buoy optimism.However, the company observed that customers reduced testing volumes where they could. The company also reported prolonged pipelines, especially with regard to equipment sales. Increases in aflatoxin test kits, Soleris consumables and food quality test kits were offset by a significant decline in Soleris equipment due to a difficult comparison against strong sales in the prior year. Also, allergen and environmental sanitation product lines declined due to reduced buying patterns from customers and supply chain disruptions on certain products.A decline in operating profit on mounting operating costs does not bode well. The ongoing supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to pose challenges for the company.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksNeogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Abiomed ABMD.

However, forex remains a headwind.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 47.3% compared with the industry's decline of 17.6% on a year-to-date basis. The S&amp;P 500 Index has lost 21.3% in the same time frame.The company, with a market capitalization of $6.52 billion, is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables, dental laboratory products, dental specialty products and consumable medical device products. It anticipates earnings to improve 10.4% next year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Favoring the Stock?DENTSPLY's introduction of PrimeScan, a digital impression scanner, and Primemill, among other major products, has been driving the company's top line over the past couple of years. It bolstered the consumable areas with Surefil one, Palodent 360 and the digital denture program. The company's Astra EV Implant has been gaining momentum as well.The company launched Primeprint, a medical-grade, highly automated 3D printer, earlier this year to bolster dentists’ workflows and practice efficiency. Apart from being an easy-to-use device, this 3D printer enables dentists to delegate tasks related to 3D printing to their staff. Primeprint provides complete integration with the CEREC system and will enable the dentist to produce things like night guards, surgical guides and full-scale models in a quick and inexpensive manner.Last year, the company launched ProTaper Ultimate, which is the first major endodontic platform innovation introduced in its endo business in more than five years. As part of a new platform, this will include new files of biosymmetric sealer and a new disinfection device. Apart from this, the company will introduce multiple new motor systems in the upcoming months. It will launch CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan as it further enhances speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new dental scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace.Story continuesApart from these proven products, the company has an excellent new product pipeline that will aid its performance in 2022 and beyond.DENTSPLY's overall growth strategy rests on product innovation. The company's solid internal growth despite challenging macroeconomic headwinds has been primarily driven by its innovative products. It has been pursuing many research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives to support technological development. It will enable DENTSPLY to focus on a more significant and sustainable innovation. This allows the company to focus on developing larger and more impactful initiatives in the quarters ahead.What's Weighing on It?DENTSPLY has a significant international presence. Consequently, a strengthening U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies, has the potential to negatively impact the company's results.DENTSPLY SIRONA has been unable to file its quarterly reports with the SEC in time due to an investigation of certain financial reporting matters initiated by its internal audit committee in May. The investigation hindered the preparation of financial reports during the second quarter as well. The company received a written notice from Nasdaq for filing delinquency from the exchange for its non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules due to the non-filing of quarterly results. The delay in filing quarterly results due to the ongoing investigation may result in DENTSPLY SIRONA losing its coveted position.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. PriceDENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Air Products and Chemicals is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.099 = US$2.4b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 9.9%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Chemicals industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Air Products and Chemicals here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Air Products and Chemicals Tell Us?The returns on capital haven't changed much for Air Products and Chemicals in recent years. The company has employed 56% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 9.9%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom Line On Air Products and Chemicals' ROCELong story short, while Air Products and Chemicals has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 75% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesAir Products and Chemicals does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Air Products and Chemicals  that you might be interested in.While Air Products and Chemicals isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Increasing the company's use of zero-emission renewable power will significantly help Cummins move closer to that target.The Rocky Mount Engine Plant (RMEP) produces mid-range diesel and natural gas engines for more than 500 customers and is a major employer in Nash County with over 1,800 people employed at the location. The 3.62 MW solar farm, which sits on 14 acres, produces power directly sent to the plant, reducing its commercial energy needs.The solar installation will produce around 5.6 million kWh of power annually and more than 136 million kWh over 25 years. The solar installation will anually sequester the carbon equivalent of 4,862 acres of forest, roughly the space occupied by the Raleigh-Durham International Airport.""We have ambitious sustainability goals in PLANET 2050 - aligned with the Paris climate accords (with) a target to be carbon-neutral by 2050 - and are fully committed to achieving them,"" said Jennifer Rumsey, President and CEO, Cummins. ""To get there, our efforts must touch our products, customers, facilities, employees and supply chain. This project is a reflection of that, and our goal of reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions from facilities and operations by half by 2030. I was delighted to participate in the ribbon cutting of the solar farm this spring, and proud to see it now in operation and making an impact.""Story continuesUnique to RMEP, the project uses solar tracking panels. This system has a single-axis tracker allowing the panels to arc and track the sun as it rises and sets. This increases system efficiency without having to install more panels. The tracking panels were installed with a ground mount, due to the project having the available space and in turn being able to maximize the system size for optimal exposure.The solar array was installed by the RMEP Engineering and Corporate Environmental teams to reduce purchased electrical consumption.The largest solar array within the company is on top of the Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company (BFCEC) in Beijing, China, one of the company's busiest plants. RMEP's installation is Cummins' largest solar array in the United States and the largest Cummins-owned solar installation globally.Cummins has completed 51 solar array installations at locations all around the world from Australia to North America. Thirty-five of these projects have been completed since 2019, with 21 installations in India, where Cummins to date has its largest renewable footprint. Work is taking place on planning for an additional 44 new solar installations at Cummins sites, including 15 additional projects in the U.S. and nine locations in China. Additional arrays are planned at other Cummins facilities, including sites in Australia, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.Cummins Inc., Friday, October 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719477/Cummins-Second-Largest-Solar-Farm-Goes-Live-at-Rocky-Mount-Engine-Plant]"

Discovery, consider bundling their various services along with its streaming packages.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: We could soon be seeing more streamers partnering for bundles. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Amazon executives have been exploring selling bundles of streaming services at discounted prices through its Amazon Prime Video channels. And the Journal also reporting that Warner Brothers Discovery has discussed eventually participating in bundles with some of its rivals. It really does seem as if we're coming full circle.But I mean, we're seeing some analysts saying we're not going back to the days of cable, not to compare it, because he was saying-- and this was from Devin Emery of Curiosity. He was saying that the problem with bundling wasn't that people didn't like it. They weren't liking what they were paying for a service that they weren't really using. So a bit of nuance there, though, Seana. Would you agree, though?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, but I guess my only response to that would be, I guess, if you pay for a bundle, I don't know if you would necessarily use everything that's included in that bundle. So that would be interesting to see. And also just in terms of the pricing, that's going to be key. We don't really know from this report from the Journal exactly what Amazon is thinking, if Prime is going to be included in these bundles, or if they're thinking of maybe partnering with some other streamers and bundling their services.It's very, very vague just in terms of where they see the direction of this going. Dave, though, I do think it is a natural step in order for us to see more of these types of bundle offers, though, just given the fact that growth there within the sector has been so hard for so many of the leaders here within streaming. We certainly have seen saturation. So many companies are trying to be innovative in terms of what they're doing to drive new customers, to get new customers into their service here. Ad tier is part of that, but bundling, I think, makes sense. So it'll be interesting, though, to see how they do it.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Well, we just showed the two main bundles that do exist right now with the leader out of the gate, really, is that one on your left there. Disney bundle has Disney, Hulu, and ESPN+. And that makes a lot of sense for people. That's a 44% discount off of if you paid for all three of those services separately.But now, some research from CR Research shows that the average consumer is spending $219 a month right now between cable and their streaming services. So everything we got away from, we are now back in. And that's why the Wall Street Journal calls it the great rebundling. Perhaps the best example of what Amazon might do is what Walmart's doing with their membership, now getting a deal with Paramount+ and partnering there.But there's no natural streamer that fits with Amazon Prime because they have everything in the space now with movies and television shows and now live sports. I can't imagine who a natural partner would be. But yes, we're getting back to exactly what we ran away from.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it's tough because when you figure in Walmart, their service is already $98, so are people just going to do these sort of mini bundles? Will there be a bunch of overlap if you want a bit of something and something else? Do you have to get two bundles? It's a lot. I'm not looking forward to it. But hey, if it gives us more options, we can save, like, 44%. I will do the bundling math. I will try.]"

The rate, if approved by the commission, will allow the company to generate funds required for an upgrade of the electric grid, which will lower the duration of outages and create resistance against extreme weather. Investments made by Duke Energy Progress in the past five years have helped to save more than 3 million hours of total lost outage time for customers. This is the first-rate appeal from the Duke Energy unit since 2019 and the proposed rate hike, if approved by NCUC, will be implemented in the next three years. The net increase in retail revenues in year one is about $326 million or 8.5%, followed by $151 million (3.9%) in year two and $138 million (3.6%) in year three – a total 16% increase by late 2025. Rate hikes impact the monthly expenses of customers, but a reasonable rate increase is the only way to allow utility operators to recover the expenses made to strengthen their infrastructure for providing reliable services to customers. The new Customer Assistance Program proposed by the Duke Energy unit, as part of the rate case, can assist customers in financial distress.Utilities Invest in InfrastructureThe domestic-focused regulated utilities continue to make investments in their infrastructure to ensure reliable supply and more energy generation from clean power sources. Duke Energy, by investing heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects, remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities.

Courtesy of persistent renewable asset additions to its generation portfolio and execution across all business segments, NextEra Energy expects to witness a CAGR of more than 10% for earnings per share through 2025 from the 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.55. The long-term earnings growth of NextEra Energy is currently pegged at 9.66%. NextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). American Electric Power aims to invest approximately $24.8 billion in its transmission and distribution business during the 2022-2026 period to construct a more efficient grid and deliver custom energy solutions to customers.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.M&amp;T Bank Corporation in FocusHeadquartered in Buffalo, M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 19.88% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.2 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.61%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.84%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.76%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.80 is up 6.7% from last year. In the past five-year period, M&amp;T Bank Corporation has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.92%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, M&amp;T Bank Corporation's payout ratio is 37%, which means it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MTB is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $15.18 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 10%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MTB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The bank is expected to keep enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities, which reflect its strong balance sheet and liquidity positions. Hence, it seems to be a wise idea to add the stock to your portfolio now.Analysts also seem optimistic regarding MTB’s earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been revised marginally upward over the past week. Thus, MTB currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking at its price performance, shares of the company have gained 19.8% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 27.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Some other factors, which make M&amp;T Bankstock an attractive investment option at present, are mentioned below.Earnings per share (EPS) Growth: The company recorded EPS growth, seeing a 20-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6%.CBSH also has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 8.5%.Strong Leverage: M&amp;T Bank’sdebt/equity ratio is 0.13 versus the industry’s average of 0.75. This shows that it uses relatively less debt to finance its operations. Thus, the company will be financially stable, even in adverse economic conditions.Net Interest Income (NII) Growth: M&amp;T Bank managed to register solid quarterly results even during the financial crisis. NII witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% over the seven years (2015-2021) with the rise continuing in the first half of 2022 on higher interest rates.The company operates as a solid and sustainable regional bank franchise, with a footprint spanning six Mid-Atlantic States as well as DC. This should allow it to continue generating a decent level of interest income in the upcoming quarters, with a gradual improvement in the lending scenario and rising interest rates.Story continuesInorganic Growth: Given its robust liquidity position, M&amp;T Bank is well-positioned to grow via acquisitions. In April 2022, M&amp;T Bank completed the acquisition of People's United for $8.3 billion. It expects to realize cost savings of $330 million by early 2023, with the deal to be accretive to earnings. Further, the acquisition of People’s United increased M&amp;T Bank’s loans by $36 billion and deposits by $53 billion.Other Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of other top-ranked banks amid the current market backdrop are Associated Banc-Corp ASB and Bank of Hawaii BOH.

Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR, and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart, and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue, the company is a scaled business, and combined with Paylocity, Bamboo, and other dynamic tech companies in the sector, the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim, and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward.6.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if HP is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil and gas well-drilling contractor holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For HP, shares are up 4.2% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is up 3.27% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 0.72% compares favorably with the industry's 0.42% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Helmerich &amp; Payne have increased 12.53% over the past quarter, and have gained 41.25% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -2.23% and -12.76%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to HP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HP is currently averaging 906,915 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HP.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HP's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.08 to -$0.04 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that HP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Helmerich &amp; Payne on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

232,8989fec8-2b9d-31ae-8126-b0c252278cd4,NDAQ,2022-10-08,Details of the Deal: Inside Nasdaq Acquisition of Metrio,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/details-deal-inside-nasdaq-acquisition-164000323.html,1665160800,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 7, 2022 / The environmental, social and governance (ESG) landscape is rapidly evolving, with an increasingly vast and intricate web of climate disclosure requirements, standards, metrics and frameworks for companies to consider. As part of its commitment to helping corporations achieve impact in their ESG journey, Nasdaq has acquired Metrio, a Montreal-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider with a platform for collecting, tracking, analyzing, disclosing and communicating on granular ESG data. The deal not only expands Nasdaq's suite of ESG solutions but will also unlock value by streamlining the reporting process and contributing to a more sustainable world.We recently spoke with Patrick Elie and Pierre-Alexandre Hurtubise, the Co-founders of Metrio, and Michael Bartels, Senior Vice President and Head of IR &amp; ESG Services at Nasdaq, about what this acquisition will mean for companies navigating an increasingly complex ESG landscape and how together they are establishing a comprehensive approach to ESG reporting and disclosure.Patrick and Pierre-Alexandre, what is Metrio, and what led you to create the company?Pierre-Alexandre: Metrio is an end-to-end sustainability reporting platform. Our software not only helps businesses collect, aggregate and interpret a host of granular data about their ESG performance but also empowers them to navigate the increasingly intricate web of proposed climate disclosure requirements, consolidated frameworks and emerging providers. In the same way that corporations would see ERP as the backbone of their financial processes, Metrio is a single source of truth for companies tackling ESG. The granularity of the data allows users to collect and slice and dice, and gives them a lot of flexibility and visibility into tracking, managing and sharing their progress with their stakeholders.Patrick: In 2009, when we founded Metrio, we were creating a solution for a major pain point that most companies didn't have on their radar yet in large parts of the world outside of Europe. We were on a quest to help build a more sustainable future, driven by the simple idea that we can improve what we can measure. We were a long way from the upcoming SEC climate disclosure laws that were recently proposed in the U.S. Similar to any new technology, our first corporate clients were early adopters that understood the importance of sustainability reporting and the impact it could drive, not only on the planet but also on their business processes. Over the years, we've been privileged to work with corporations in Europe, the U.S. and Canada from across all different types of industries. Today, everyone understands the impact that visibility into your ESG data can drive for a business. We're past the point of discussing if companies should report, and now, we're at a stage where the conversation is around - what should companies be reporting on? When it comes to reporting on Scope 3, you'll need to have more visibility across your entire supply chain and a way to collect and aggregate all that data. Our platform has evolved with these growing requirements and will continue to evolve. It's exciting to witness the transformation in the market and in our ecosystem since we first came out with our software. We feel lucky to be continuing our journey with Nasdaq and our great team.Story continuesMike, what prompted Nasdaq to acquire Metrio?At Nasdaq, we're acutely focused on helping our client community better navigate and manage the key challenges facing corporates today - including the ever-increasing obligations around ESG implementation.Our foray into the ESG space was through the organic extension of our advisory business into ESG. Due to our ecosystem position at the nexus between the issuer community and the investor community, we are well-positioned to view and understand developing trends. As thoughtful ESG programs shifted into must-haves for the issuer community, our business grew aligned with these needs. Through our advisory work, we recognized the increasing demand for issuers and the broader corporate community to fulfill key reporting obligations and expanded our efforts by acquiring OneReport in 2020.Metrio was one of the first movers in our space. As we focused on scale and expansion of the OneReport business, we developed a relationship with them and a better understanding of how they were using benchmarks, analytics and a KPI-driven approach to transform how organizations view ESG. As we became more attune with customer needs and demands in this space, it became more evident that Metrio is a natural fit with OneReport and our broader ESG portfolio, and that they shared our drive towards supporting a more sustainable world.Pierre-Alexandre, as ESG-related disclosures evolve, how does Metrio help companies with their ESG reporting?Metrio assists companies in streamlining their ESG reporting process by focusing on four key pillars:Collecting data: We can simplify and shorten the collection process through manual and automated data collection tools that gather granular data and content from across different departments, sites and roles in a business. Collected data is assigned to an owner, checked, and users are automatically prompted to enter new data, correct highlighted errors and add supporting documents when necessary. For companies that have been using spreadsheets for data collection, our solution can save them countless hours of valuable time and ensure they're ready for the audit period.Measuring performance: Our software enables corporations to monitor their ESG performance and get valuable real-time insights with sustainability analytics and dashboard tools. Companies can select metrics based on materiality or any framework, such as SASB, GRI, CDP, and more. Moreover, businesses can customize calculation methodologies and generate KPIs. Those KPIs can also include forecasts to better identify ESG risks and opportunities that they can take action on.Reporting and disclosing data: Companies can create multiple reports based on any framework or establish their own through our software solution.Then, they can select desired filters and gather all data and texts to generate a ready-to-publish PDF, PowerPoint, Word or Excel report. To validate, internal or external audits can certify data and methodology. We ensure our users are able to meet any disclosure requirements, existing or coming up.Communicating ESG story: Corporations can enhance stakeholder engagement and sustainability communications by leveraging our Communications solutions, which allow them to create a dedicated sustainability website to share their vision and performance through interactive charts, graphics and more, combining both quantitative and qualitative information.Ultimately, we want to empower companies to become more sustainable, transparent and profitable by giving them the tools to measure and improve their impact on people and the planet. By helping issuers and business leaders with their ESG reporting, they can decrease risk and create value while building a better place to work and attract talent.Mike, what are the synergies with Nasdaq's suite of ESG offerings? How can companies leverage both offerings?Together, Metrio and Nasdaq can help corporates navigate the increasingly complex ESG landscape by reducing friction in strategizing, collecting, analyzing, reporting and communicating key ESG responsibilities and opportunities.Taking a truly complementary approach, we will harness Metrio's leadership in data collection, KPI assessment and corporate social responsibility report publishing and combine it with Nasdaq's mapping expertise, guidance notes and deep relationships with raters and frameworks. This will allow us to address the full depth and breadth of customer challenges as the ESG ecosystem matures.Patrick and Mike, how will Nasdaq's acquisition of Metrio help advance ESG reporting and disclosure?Mike: Experience tells us that continuing growth of varying stakeholder needs across multi-faceted obligations will necessitate more data, more KPIs and a greater ability to disseminate and communicate ESG information at speed. The technological know-how that sits in both of our organizations-to ingest, understand and normalize multiple data formats, manage them, triangulate across various points to create holistic cross-company benchmarks, measure progress and disseminate that information to frameworks and other key stakeholder groups in a variety of formats-will help us establish pragmatic solutions with an even more comprehensive approach to ESG reporting and disclosure. When you layer on the 400+ years' experience of our collective teams, we have one of the deepest teams of experts in the industry that will help ensure our methodologies and solutions are keeping pace. And, because we are delivering via SaaS, our solutions are built for change and will be able to implement shifts in strategy as requirements evolve.Patrick: As Mike eloquently put it, our solutions are built for change. Our software is built to be scalable and to accommodate our users at every stage of their ESG reporting journey, from data collection all the way to their public communications. By combining our team's experience and knowledge in the sustainability space, as well as our robust end-to-end reporting platform's capabilities, with Nasdaq's vast expertise and resources in the corporate landscape, we will be able to accelerate our growth roadmap and continue to simplify sustainability stakeholder engagement for businesses across the world. As a whole, our goal remains the same as it has for more than a decade now, to ensure a more sustainable future for our ""pale blue dot"" of a home. Now and going forward, we have more great people on our team to help achieve that goal by empowering more businesses with the right tools.Nasdaq, Inc., Friday, October 7, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719513/Details-of-the-Deal-Inside-Nasdaq-Acquisition-of-Metrio]"

The stock market is in shambles, but for long-term investors, it has started to look like an attractive entry point.Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: “If You’re a Long-Term Investor, I Would Absolutely Buy Now”Jeremy Siegel is a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and is a notable commentator on the economy and capital markets. Mr. Siegel recently appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ where he discussed his view on why now is an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors. Here are some comments from the professor of finance at one of the top business schools in the world:“If you’re a long-term investor, I would absolutely buy now. I think these are absolutely great long-term values. Could it go down more? Of course in the short-run and in bear markets (historical), it has gone down more. But when you’re talking about 16 times earnings and even if they are clipped by a recession, you shouldn’t just base it on recession earnings you should base it on longer-term earnings, which I think are very favorable looking beyond the dip. I think these are just absolutely excellent values. Short-term, anything can happen in the short term.”While short-term investors are unwinding their positions and triggering major sell-offs, they are in fact creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces.

However, forex remains a headwind.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 47.3% compared with the industry's decline of 17.6% on a year-to-date basis. The S&amp;P 500 Index has lost 21.3% in the same time frame.The company, with a market capitalization of $6.52 billion, is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables, dental laboratory products, dental specialty products and consumable medical device products. It anticipates earnings to improve 10.4% next year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Favoring the Stock?DENTSPLY's introduction of PrimeScan, a digital impression scanner, and Primemill, among other major products, has been driving the company's top line over the past couple of years. It bolstered the consumable areas with Surefil one, Palodent 360 and the digital denture program. The company's Astra EV Implant has been gaining momentum as well.The company launched Primeprint, a medical-grade, highly automated 3D printer, earlier this year to bolster dentists’ workflows and practice efficiency. Apart from being an easy-to-use device, this 3D printer enables dentists to delegate tasks related to 3D printing to their staff. Primeprint provides complete integration with the CEREC system and will enable the dentist to produce things like night guards, surgical guides and full-scale models in a quick and inexpensive manner.Last year, the company launched ProTaper Ultimate, which is the first major endodontic platform innovation introduced in its endo business in more than five years. As part of a new platform, this will include new files of biosymmetric sealer and a new disinfection device. Apart from this, the company will introduce multiple new motor systems in the upcoming months. It will launch CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan as it further enhances speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new dental scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace.Story continuesApart from these proven products, the company has an excellent new product pipeline that will aid its performance in 2022 and beyond.DENTSPLY's overall growth strategy rests on product innovation. The company's solid internal growth despite challenging macroeconomic headwinds has been primarily driven by its innovative products. It has been pursuing many research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives to support technological development. It will enable DENTSPLY to focus on a more significant and sustainable innovation. This allows the company to focus on developing larger and more impactful initiatives in the quarters ahead.What's Weighing on It?DENTSPLY has a significant international presence. Consequently, a strengthening U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies, has the potential to negatively impact the company's results.DENTSPLY SIRONA has been unable to file its quarterly reports with the SEC in time due to an investigation of certain financial reporting matters initiated by its internal audit committee in May. The investigation hindered the preparation of financial reports during the second quarter as well. The company received a written notice from Nasdaq for filing delinquency from the exchange for its non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules due to the non-filing of quarterly results. The delay in filing quarterly results due to the ongoing investigation may result in DENTSPLY SIRONA losing its coveted position.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. PriceDENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Oracle hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Oracle peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Oracle.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?Oracle's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 55%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 31% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 36% per annum over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Oracle is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Oracle's P/EIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Oracle's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Oracle (2 are potentially serious!) that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Oracle's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

241,3988fbd7-b430-3be6-88c8-15894d81d279,MU,2022-10-08,Micron's semiconductor plant 'provides model for other communities to pursue': Syracuse mayor,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microns-semiconductor-plant-provides-model-200634634.html,1665173194,VIDEO,['MU'],"[Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh joins Yahoo Finance Live to talk about Micron's plans to open a new plant in the Syracuse, New York area and how it will promote job growth and community investment.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, let's stick with the chip makers and what we're seeing play out in the semiconductor space. Micron is the latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion CHIPS Act, announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for a plant in Syracuse, New York.Joining us now is the man who helped seal that deal. We want to welcome Syracuse mayor Ben Walsh to the program. Mayor Walsh, it's great to see you. Congratulations on this historic deal between the city of Syracuse and Micron here. Just talk to us just about the economic implications of this and the opportunity that this presents for your region.BEN WALSH: Transformational is probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity. And this week was historic. So, really, immediately, our focus shifts towards what we need to do to be prepared for this opportunity. Clearly, we have to make sure we have the workforce. We're going to see significant investments in housing. But it's very exciting. And for an older northeastern industrial city like Syracuse, it is part of a really amazing comeback story.DAVE BRIGGS: A story someday you'll have to write in the book how a small town, or at least, medium town, poured $100 billion in investment. How do you do it? Because other companies, other towns, across the country are watching to see exactly how they can do it. What was the key?BEN WALSH: Well, there are so many factors that went into it. We have a great site. The site is located about 15 to 20 minutes north of the city of Syracuse, owned by the Onondaga County Industrial Development agency. They've been investing in that site for nearly 30 years now. It is about 1,400 acres now. So we had the right site. We had the support from New York State government. Governor Hochul made a significant investment.Story continuesThe CHIPS Act, at the federal level, was critically important. And right here in the city of Syracuse, we have been in the midst of our own Renaissance, a lot of investment downtown. The city is really coming back. And as companies are trying to attract and retain talent, having a vibrant city is a critical component. And I'm proud to say we have that here in Syracuse.SEANA SMITH: Up to 50,000 jobs are expected to be created as a result of this. I guess, how do you prepare, how do you build up the workforce in order to fill that large number of jobs?BEN WALSH: Well, it takes time. And I'm pleased to say that we're not starting right now. We've been at this for quite a while now as part of our Syracuse search strategy, which is our strategy for inclusive growth in the new economy. As we've identified opportunities in what we call the fourth Industrial Revolution, we've seen certain areas where Syracuse has a competitive advantage where we have curriculum in our schools that we're developing that can make sure that our people and our workers have the right skill sets.So we have a lot of the right programs and infrastructure in place. This opportunity is just going to require us to scale them at a rate that we've never done before. So, you know, again, looking at scaling our workforce development programs, continuing to invest in housing, public transportation, all of the infrastructure that we need to accommodate this investment.DAVE BRIGGS: Some 9,000 of those jobs should make an average of $100,000 each. That is remarkable. As remarkable as this achievement was, Ben, I'm inspired by an independent mayor winning 60% of the vote in your second term. Is this something that we can see spread across the country? What allowed you to run as an independent? Because the narrative in this country is that it is a dominated two-party system, and you simply cannot break through.BEN WALSH: Well, I'll describe it within the context of this deal. The fact that we have an independent mayor, a Republican county executive, a Democratic governor, all working hand in hand to make this deal happen, is significant, and I think does provide a model for other communities to pursue at a time when our country is very divisive. I think when people focus on what we have in common and where we can have shared prosperity and growth, you can make things happen.So I hope in that way, we are a model, that we are where America is going, or hopefully, we want to be going. And as for me, it was about developing and bringing together a broad coalition, broad diverse coalition of people that had a love for this city, and that we're willing to set party politics aside for the greater good.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of being a model, making things happen, clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large companies? What else are you doing to attract jobs to your city of Syracuse?BEN WALSH: Well, similar to the point about our programs in place, our comeback story, our Renaissance is already underway. We have a facility on the south side of Syracuse, just south of downtown. A local company, JMA Wireless just constructed the first 5G wireless manufacturing facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place. Nothing to the scale of Micron, and we certainly see-- know that there will be significant follow-on opportunities, supply chain opportunities that come with Micron.But we do hope that this also puts us on the radar of many other companies around the globe that are looking for a place where, again, you have the political alignment that allows you to do business, that has the balance of a vibrant downtown, but also beautiful parks and countrysides and mountains and lakes all around us. So it's really pulling all of that together.DAVE BRIGGS: Well, congratulations on the deal. Nice of you to join us, Syracuse mayor Ben Walsh. Appreciate it. Thanks.BEN WALSH: Thank you.]"

Brands, Friday, October 7, 2022, Press release picture""Moving to the USA, a place where the possibilities are endless.""This was a major turning point for Heberto, a 24-year-old General Manager (GM) in Miami, Florida. He was born in Matanzas, Cuba and came to the United States with his mother at the age of 16. They were now in the ""Land of Opportunity;"" however, his chances of success seemed far away.Eager to begin working, his first job was at Taco Bell when he was 17 years old. He started as a Team Member - learning the industry, improving his English skills, and never losing sight of the support that he wanted to be for his family. Through that hard work and dedication, it's no surprise that he became a Shift Lead. He took chances, seized every opportunity, and eventually got involved in a management role which helped him realize how much he enjoyed leading others.""I loved the environment and culture [which gave me] the desire to continue growing in the company. That is why I became a GM… and with the support of all my supervisors.""When first coming to the States, his English was limited to greetings and a few numbers. ""Learning the language was the biggest challenge that I had to face and I'm continuing to face it."" He only sees a positive gain from learning another language though - he's improving every day and says that his position as a GM helps him as well. ""Being a bilingual person will open opportunities in your personal and professional life. It definitely has a big impact on the person I am today.""With that in mind, Heberto encourages others to lead with their inner desires and never stop building their knowledge just like he continues to do in his own life. ""Learning and studying other cultures [here in the U.S.] has helped me appreciate and understand mine even more.""Story continuesHeberto's father, stepmom and two little sisters remain in Cuba. He says that his family is the main source of his inspiration and motivation. Specifically, his two younger sisters for whom he wants to be an excellent role model.

BloombergSen Investment Partners is a Canadian hedge fund that is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. The firm was set up by Mr. Jonathan Bloomberg in 2008, and it is a privately-held company.Mr. Bloomberg has decades of experience working in the financial industry. He completed his bachelor's degree in economics from Tufts University in 1996. Immediately after graduating, the executive embarked on his decades long career in the financial world, by starting work as an analyst at the firm Salomon Smith Barney, focusing on mergers and acquisitions and high yield initial and secondary public offerings. He would go on to work at the firm for two years, leaving the role in 1998. A year later he would then decide to expand his education and secure admission at the illustrious Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania for his Master's in Business Administration.The MBA would prove to be fruitful, as immediately after graduating, Mr. Bloomberg would head on to become a vice president of Burgundy Asset Management, an independent asset management firm also based in Canada. At this fund, the executive worked for its small and medium business funds for both Canadian and American companies. After leaving Burgundy in 2007, the now hedge fund executive set up BloomberSen a couple of months later in February 2008.BloombergSen describes itself as a long term, value investor. Through this, the firm evaluates its investment decisions over the course of five to ten years, as opposed to monthly or annually evaluating them like some of its other peers. This also provides it with tax benefits and low costs as the investments remain in its portfolio for a longer time period. Additionally, the firms that it chooses to invest in often have stable revenue, strong market positions, and low competition - which then ends up benefitting the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation process through lower volatility. A DCF model projects a company's cash flow into the future and adjusts it with the cost of capital and debt to wager a guess at the current true value to determine whether the market share price is under or overvalued.Story continuesAdditionally, the hedge fund does not open its doors to anyone, and if someone is looking to invest with BloombergSen, then a minimum investment of $2 million is required. It also selects only those firms whose shares are significantly undervalued on the public stock market, which then ensures that the portfolio as a whole is protected from both economic downturns and other volatility factors.By the end of this year's second quarter, BloombergSen had a portfolio that was worth $1.6 billion. In this portfolio, some top firms that are well known globally are W. R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB), Aon plc (NYSE:AON), and Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI).Source: https://bloombergsen.com/team/jonathan-bloomberg/Our Methodology We took a look at BloombergSen's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pick out its top investments for this year's June quarter.10 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Jonathan Bloomberg's BloombergSen10.

We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.”HCA Healthcare, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American company that has a host of services and products under its portfolio that range from software platforms to consumer technology gadgets. The software side has services such as YouTube, search engine Google, and Gmail, while the gadget side includes smartphones, smart speakers, and notebooks.Alphabet Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported another strong quarterly result despite the tough macroeconomic conditions. Revenue increased by 13% as Search proved resilient, primarily led by strength in the travel and retail verticals. YouTube advertising growth was lighter and moderated due to a tough comparison period and a general softening in brand advertising spend. That said, YouTube’s user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company’s overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency. Overall, we’re pleased with how the company has performed and are confident that management will be able to control costs, if or when the economic environment becomes more challenging.”6. Humana Inc.

251,11ad9682-6190-338b-84e8-bba4c9f36ff9,PLD,2022-10-08,"Terreno Realty (TRNO) Sees High Occupancy, Rent Growth in Q3",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/terreno-realty-trno-sees-high-135301987.html,1665150781,STORY,"['TRNO', 'PLD', 'REXR-PC']","[Terreno Realty Corporation TRNO witnessed a rise in quarter-end occupancy and an increase in cash rents on new and renewed leases in the third quarter. These reflect solid demand for the company’s properties.In its recently issued operating update, TRNO noted that for its operating portfolio, the occupancy reached 98.4% as of Sep 30, 2022, marking an expansion of 50 basis points (bps) from the prior quarter-end and 40 bps from the year-ago quarter-end. Moreover, its same-store portfolio was 98.9% leased on Sep 30, 2022.Terreno Realty was able to lock in higher rents on new and renewed leases, reflecting resilience in its portfolio. Cash rents on new and renewed leases (commenced during the third quarter) aggregating 0.7 million square feet and 5.1 acres of improved land grew 65.9%. The tenant retention ratio for the operating portfolio was 76.2% and 53.3% for the improved land portfolio.Terreno Realty continued to expand its portfolio through acquisitions in the July-September quarter. During the said period, TRNO shelled out a total of $65.9 million as the purchase price for the acquisition of four properties comprising four improved land parcels of around 12.2 acres.It has around $37.7 million of acquisitions under contract and $65.1 million of acquisitions under letters of intent. From the beginning of the year through Oct 6, 2022, Terreno Realty acquired 16 properties comprising 14 buildings, containing roughly 766,000 square feet, and 10 improved land parcels of around 32.9 acres for a total purchase price of $355.4 million.As of Sep 30, 2022, Terreno Realty’s portfolio included 252 buildings spanning 15.4 million square feet and 46 improved land parcels encompassing 159.9 acres. It also had two properties under redevelopment.On the capital market activity front, in the third quarter, Terreno Realty issued a new $100 million five-year unsecured term loan. The company has no remaining debt maturities in 2022 or 2023. In the said period, TRNO issued 444,512 shares of the common stock, with a weighted average offering price of $64.97 per share, reaping gross proceeds of $28.9 million under its at-the-market equity offering program.Story continuesConclusionTerreno Realty’s efforts to expand and strengthen its portfolio with acquisitions are a strategic fit. These also indicate that the company is financially sound to execute such deals.There has been a significant increase in e-commerce’s share of total retail sales, spurring demand for warehouse and distribution spaces. Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, industrial real estate space is anticipated to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This, in turn, will keep supporting industrial landlords like Terreno Realty, Prologis PLD and Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. REXR to enjoy a favorable market environment.However, with the industrial asset category being attractive presently, there is a development boom in several markets. This high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. This might affect the growth tempo of Terreno Realty, Prologis and Rexford Industrial Realty to some extent.Shares of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Terreno Realty have declined 7.1% over the past three months, narrower than the industry’s fall of 12.7%.

We believe this is critical in order to address global climate change and protect the local ecosystems that farmers need to grow sustainable raw materials.Focusing for Maximum ImpactOur 2018 Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) helped us focus our efforts for maximum positive impact.

It sets out the aims and progress made by the Coalition in its first year, as everyone involved works together to achieve a forest positive future.Leading the WayWe were the first company to raise the issue of deforestation in the cocoa industry, at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 21, in Paris.We are a founding signatory of the Cocoa &amp; Forests Initiative (CFI) and continue to be a driving force to accelerate industry change.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +9.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +227.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.87 points to a change of +326.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.94 indicates a change of -17.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $9.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +45.4%. The $39.02 billion and $36.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +48.3% and -6.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $10.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +78.6%. EPS of $3.16 for the same period compares with $0.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.22%. The EPS surprise was +7.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peKeen to find out how analysts think Vertex Pharmaceuticals' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Vertex Pharmaceuticals would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 63% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 44% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 7.8% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Vertex Pharmaceuticals currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Vertex Pharmaceuticals that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

273,1e77e077-7a11-3b37-a173-cb7c3fa126df,KO,2022-10-08,PepsiCo Earnings Preview: Should Investors be Thirsty for PEP Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-earnings-preview-investors-thirsty-235911963.html,1665187151,STORY,"['PEP', 'KO']","[Investors will get a taste of how PepsiCo PEP is handling the increasingly tough operating environment when it releases its third quarter FY22 financial results on Wednesday, October 12.While many businesses struggle during high inflationary periods, investors hope that PepsiCo can excel or at least shrug off the current economic downturn. PEP’s stock has performed considerably better than the broader market this year and may very well help investors fight inflation.PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola KO have historically been defensive hedges amidst economic uncertainty given their standing as consumer staples giants.Let’s take a look at what to expect from PEP’s Q3 earnings release to see how PepsiCo is performing during the economic uncertainty.Overview Trading roughly 10% from its highs, it will be important to see if consumers’ thirst for PepsiCo’s products continued during the third quarter. PepsiCo has also diversified its business to include complimentary brands like Frito Lay Snacks, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices, and Quaker foods.Last quarter PEP beat earnings expectations by 7% and sales remained stable despite consumers dealing with rising expenses such as gas. CEO Ramon Laguarta mentioned that while PepsiCo is concerned about rising inflation PEP had not seen a shift in consumer purchasing behavior.Performance PEP is only down -6% year to date, outperforming the S&amp;P 500’’s -22%, as investors look for stability amid market uncertainty. Although the S&amp;P 500’s +315% climb, beat PEP’s performance over the last 20 years, we can see from the nearby chart that PEP stock held up much better than the broader market during the financial crisis. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf we take the most recent five years of the 20-year chart and focus on the total return including dividends, we will see that PEP has outperformed the benchmark. PEP’s impressive +70% total return outpaced the S&amp;P 500’s +64%. This also crushed rival Coca-Cola’s +20% total return. PEP’s total return in the last year is +4%, which also topped the benchmark’s -16% and KO’s return is virtually flat.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlook The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP’s Q3 earnings is $1.84 a share, which would represent a 3% increase from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are also expected to be up 3% at $20.85 billion. Estimates for the period have mostly stayed the same over the past two months.Year over year, PEP is projected to post 6% earnings growth in 2022, with its FY23 earnings set to grow another 8%. Solid top line growth is also expected, with FY22 sales projected to rise 5% and another 3% in FY23 to $86.74 billion.PepsiCo is also expected to see 7.6% earnings growth over the next five years, which Is above Coca-Cola’s 6.4%.Valuation Trading around $162 a share, PEP has a forward P/E of 24.4X. This is lower than its high of 27.8X over the last decade and not too far from the median of 21.6X.PEP’s P/E is slightly higher than the industry average of 22.3X, which is on par with rival KO as well. However, investors have historically been willing to pay a premium for PEP compared to its industry.PEP’s cash flow per share of 8.1 is higher than the industry average of 0.5 and KO at 2.6. PepsiCo’s higher cash flow could certainly be important in the current economic downturn as operating costs could rise.Bottom Line PepsiCo’s third quarter earnings are much anticipated and will help investors get a clearer view of how consumer spending behavior has affected the company. This will also give insight into PEP’s stock being a potential hedge against inflation or if the current economic conditions have started to weigh on the company.PEP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Beverages-Soft Drinks Industry is in the bottom 32% of over 250 Zacks Industries. However, PEP’s 2.83% annual dividend yield at $4.60 a share helps investors add solid income as well.While PepsiCo’s dividend yield is lower than Coca-Cola’s 3.20% yield, the combination of a solid dividend along with its growth has helped the stock outperform its rival and the benchmark over the last five years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to a report by S&amp;P Global, citing Bloomberg, the S&amp;P 500 companies that raised their dividends delivered a 12.7% return in 2020, compared with a 6.5% decline in the dividend cutters.The additional income earned through these dividends investments is beneficial for investors, especially in times of financial instability.

The report also mentioned that reinvested dividends significantly increased overall S&amp;P 500 returns from 1990 to 2020.In the third quarter of 2022, dividend payments increased by $17.7 billion, compared with $17.6 billion in the previous quarter.

However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”8. Pfizer Inc.

Its free cash flow stood at $7.4 billion, compared with $5.9 billion a quarter earlier. The company paid $4.5 billion in dividends to shareholders, which shows that its FCF is stable for shareholder returns. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend Stocks for Growth11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To BuyTop 10 REIT Stocks Under $10Disclosure.

Here are some comments from the professor of finance at one of the top business schools in the world:“If you’re a long-term investor, I would absolutely buy now. I think these are absolutely great long-term values. Could it go down more? Of course in the short-run and in bear markets (historical), it has gone down more. But when you’re talking about 16 times earnings and even if they are clipped by a recession, you shouldn’t just base it on recession earnings you should base it on longer-term earnings, which I think are very favorable looking beyond the dip. I think these are just absolutely excellent values. Short-term, anything can happen in the short term.”While short-term investors are unwinding their positions and triggering major sell-offs, they are in fact creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Stryker could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Stryker peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Stryker.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Stryker would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered virtually the same number to the company's bottom line as the year before. Whilst it's an improvement, it wasn't enough to get the company out of the hole it was in, with earnings down 42% overall from three years ago. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 24% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Stryker is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Stryker's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Stryker maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Stryker (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you need to be mindful of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Stryker, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more growth stocks in Dalio’s portfolio, click 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Ray Dalio. Ray Dalio, after a 47-year successful investment career, stepped down from his role as the co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates at the end of September, and he gave up his voting rights as well. However, he said that he would advise the present co-CIOs, Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, and the rest of the investment committee. As of the end of 2021, under Ray Dalio’s leadership, Bridgewater had returned $52.2 billion to clients since 1975, although returns in 2021 were just $5.7 billion on assets under management of $99.2 billion.For the last few years, Ray Dalio had been repeatedly saying that ""cash is trash"". However, he has now warmed up to the idea of holding US dollars and believes that it is an acceptable investment. In April 2020, he declared cash as basically worthless, given the near-zero interest rates and elevated money supply, which would lower the value of dollars. He tweeted on October 3: ""At existing interest rates and with the Fed shrinking the balance sheet, it is now about neutral – neither a very good or very bad deal. In other words, the short-term interest rate is now about right.""Dalio predicts long-term interest rates of over 4.5%, which means rates might climb as per Dalio’s assumptions in the coming years. The $23.6 billion Bridgewater portfolio has a healthy mix of growth and value equities. Some of the best growth plays in Dalio’s fund include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Ray DalioOur Methodology We selected the following growth equities based on high price-to-earnings ratios, which exceeded 30 as of October 6. The growth stocks were chosen from Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates portfolio as of the second quarter of 2022. Story continuesWe have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2022 database of about 900 elite hedge funds. Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Ray Dalio12.

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 995,357 shares of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) worth about $95 million as of Q2 2022. On September 15, the US FDA approved Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)’s PASCAL Precision transcatheter valve repair system for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. It is used for patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation.Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch on October 5 maintained a Buy rating on Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) but lowered the price target on the shares to $107 from $118. The analyst is bullish on device utilization in a normalized environment and said ""the best thing that could come out of the 3Q season is an in-line delivery, 2022 reiterations, and a level setting for 2023.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 39 hedge funds were long Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 7.3 million shares worth $697 million. Like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) is one of the best growth stocks in Ray Dalio’s portfolio. Here is what Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund has to say about Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Innovation can foster growth in Health Care fields other than drug discovery. Edwards Lifesciences makes minimally invasive devices to treat heart disease or for critical care monitoring. Its transcatheter heart valve, SAPIEN, is the most-implanted aortic heart valve in the world. Having settled a lawsuit with Abbott over alleged patent infringement, Edwards is now moving ahead with a newer product line called PASCAL to treat elderly or frail patients—for whom currently available treatments are ineffective—for mitral and tricuspid disease. PASCAL is the fruit of the company’s ongoing investment in research and development. Between PASCAL and its next-generation SAPIEN valve, the company expects to double its addressable market to approximately US$20 billion by 2028.”11. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is headquartered in Newport Beach, California, operating a chain of Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Ray Dalio’s hedge fund owns 90,664 shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) as of Q2 2022, worth $118.5 million, representing 0.5% of the total securities. It is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. On October 4, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan raised the price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) to $1,708 from $1,503 and reiterated a Hold rating on the shares ahead of the Q3 results. The analyst believes investor expectations for Q3 same-store-sales results are in line with the present consensus estimate of 7.4%. He thinks Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) could meet a Q4 consensus same-store-sales estimate of up to 8.5%. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) at the end of June 2022, compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.10 million shares worth $1.4 billion. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings specifically said about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales, price increases to cover cost inflation, and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)10. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), a Chinese company operating an e-commerce platform, is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. The Bridgewater portfolio held 4.8 million shares of Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in Q2 2022, worth $297.5 million, representing 1.26% of the total securities. The stock has featured in Ray Dalio’s fund since Q2 2019. On September 2, Barclays analyst Jiong Shao raised the price target on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) to $66 from $45 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The company posted ""surprisingly stronger than expected topline and gross margins"" in Q2, the analyst told investors. However, ""limited disclosures"" were offered as usual, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 36 funds in the last quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 6.15 million shares worth about $381 million. Here is what Tao Value has to say about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue to grow with such a team with a strong culture.”9. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) is a New Jersey-based company that develops, manufactures, and sells medical supplies, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic products for healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, and pharmaceutical markets worldwide. Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) is one of the best growth stocks in Ray Dalio’s Q2 portfolio, with the billionaire holding a $110.3 million position in the company. On October 4, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar added Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) to the firm's ""TAP Outperform"" list ahead of Q3 earnings of the group. His earnings previews are influenced by the ""interesting"" results from Evercore’s three different surveys on Hospital CapEx/Procedures, lab activity, and U.S. TAVR trends, the analyst noted. He has an Outperform rating and a $275 price target on Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) shares.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were long Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 49 funds in the last quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.20 million shares worth $789.4 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about Becton, Dickinson, and Company (NYSE:BDX) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like medical equipment (medical device and laboratory supplier Becton Dickinson). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8. Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Pleasanton, California. The company provides cloud-based software for the life sciences industry in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 497,587 shares of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) as of the second quarter of 2022, worth $98.5 million. Dalio boosted his stake by 29% in Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in Q2 and it is one of the best growth stocks in his portfolio. On September 15, KeyBanc analyst Scott Schoenhaus assumed coverage of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) with an Overweight rating and a $220 price target. The analyst is positive on Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV)’s ability to successfully address new services with its R&amp;D/Vault platform. The analyst added that he sees Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) as well positioned to boost its top line at 15% over the next few years at stable 40% EBIT margins, which are some of the highest in all HCIT and SaaS universes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), with 757,605  shares worth $150 million. Overall, 45 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of June 2022, up from 41 funds in the prior quarter. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) is one of the highest quality franchises in our portfolio. The company has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations, and it is replicating that success with the rollout of numerous other modules focused on pharmaceutical customers’ manufacturing, quality, safety and clinical operations. Growth has temporarily slowed over the past year as the company laps difficult YoY comparisons caused by the rapid adoption of their virtual sales call solution during the pandemic. Several large deals also encountered unexpected delays in late 2021. Despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident in Veeva’s future growth prospects and high-quality business model (~40% free cash flow margins supported by largely recurring subscription revenues). Meanwhile, we believe the defensive nature of its end market (health care) and strategic importance of cloud IT driven transformations could help buffer the company against a weaker global economy. As shares declined in Q2 along with other software stocks, we added to our position.”7. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is a ​​New York-based manufacturer and marketer of skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products worldwide.

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Ray Dalio. On September 20, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $303, up from $298. China's zero-Covid policy still impacts the company's business, but after the derating in the stock, these headwinds are now ""adequately reflected"" in the valuation, the analyst told investors. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the leading position holder in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), with approximately 6 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Overall, 46 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of June 2022. Here is what Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund has to say about The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold cosmetic producer Estée Lauder, which we bought last March. At the time, the market reflected a dire outlook for retail demand, especially tourist-related; however, we found its Chinese business attractive and admired its agility across social media and other digital channels. As the stock has appreciated, the resulting valuation now leaves no room for error, such as a potential shift of Chinese consumers’ tastes away from US brands.”6.

Ray Dalio owns 629,041 shares of Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) as of Q2 2022, worth over $125 million and representing 0.53% of the total 13F portfolio. On October 5, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch maintained a Buy recommendation on Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) but lowered the price target on the shares to $246 from $255, noting that hospital staffing remains a headwind but it is at least stable, and there are pockets of improved pricing. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 46 hedge funds were long Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), compared to 41 funds in the last quarter. Arrowstreet Capital is the leading stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 million shares worth $206 million. In addition to PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Airbnb, Inc.

If you want to read about some more fast money stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Raging inflation and high interest rates continue to weigh on consumer spending in the past few months, raising investor concerns around an economic recession in the United States that could slow down global growth. Final estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis reveal that the US economy shrank for the second consecutive quarter in the three months ended June, meeting the technical criteria for a recession. The GDP shrank by 0.6% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, below the initially reported 0.9% decline. The numbers indicate that storm clouds are likely to hover over the marketplace in the coming months. However, not all is doom and gloom. Newly released job data shows that payrolls increased 275,000 in September, while the unemployment rate held at 3.7%. Per a recent survey, top US economists expect average hourly earnings to increase 0.3% month-over-month in September, compared to 5.1% from a year ago. The latter number is below the figures estimated for the month of August. In this macro environment, investors are eagerly looking for stocks that offer a healthier risk/reward ratio in the near-term, primarily because investments in traditional growth offerings are a no-go. Some of the best stocks to monitor in this regard include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), among others discussed in detail below. As policymakers try to beat inflation, these options could offer investors access to fast money. Our MethodologyThe companies that have upcoming growth catalysts were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashBest Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds10.

It is one of the best fast money stocks to invest in. The company has grappled with declining prices from commodity chemicals and lower volumes in the past few months. However, the attractive yield and dividend history offers investors some much-needed solidity as the market environment becomes more volatile. On September 16, Deutsche Bank analyst David Begleiter maintained a Hold rating on LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) stock and lowered the price target to $85 from $92, noting that the company was seeing weaknesses across core segments driven by higher costs. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 37 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $953.5 million in LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB), compared to 32 in the previous quarter worth $744 million.Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) is one of the best fast money stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Howard Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We initiated a position in LyondellBasell (LYB). Chemical markets are currently robust given the combination of 2020 plant shutdowns and strongly recovering demand. Despite the tailwinds, Lyondell trades at a low valuation and yields just under 5%.”9. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), together with its subsidiaries, develops, owns, and operates integrated resorts in Asia and the United States. It is one of the top fast money stocks to invest in. The stock has climbed in the past few weeks on the back of reports that the firm is the frontrunner to operate in the home of the Mets. Steve Cohen, the owner of the Mets, is engaging city officials and casino owners to discuss the options to open a casino in Citi Field. The shares have also benefited from easing of virus restrictions across the globe. On September 26, Citi analyst George Choi maintained a Buy rating on Las Vegas Sands Corp.

(NYSE:LVS), with 4.1 million shares worth more than $138.6 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Certain travel-related businesses remain cyclically depressed not secularly challenged and should rebound as economic strength re-emerges. For example, the business operations of Macau-centric casino and gaming companies such as Las Vegas Sands Corporation (NYSE:LVS) have yet to recover due to the ongoing COVID-19 challenges in China. We expect business to rebound sharply when economic growth recovers just as it did in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Sands Corporationis a global leader in the development and operation of luxury casino resorts in Macau and Singapore, and it maintains a liquid and investment grade balance sheet. It is currently valued at a significant discount to our assessment of replacement cost, and the company’s Macau operations are valued at only 7 times estimated cash flow.” 8.

Here is what the fund said:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”7. Constellation Brands, Inc.

While extreme market volatility meant that the Integrated Gas division will deliver a lower contribution to earnings, the moderation of refining margins from their spectacular levels earlier in the year affected the Chemicals &amp; Products unit.    Now, let’s dig into some other segment-wise selected items from Thursday’s release.UpstreamAccording to the latest update, Shell’s upstream production fell 13.5% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2022 at the midpoint of the guidance. The supermajor is estimating its output in the range of 1,750-1,850 MBOE/d compared to 2,081 MBOE/d a year ago and 1,917 MBOE/d in the second quarter of 2022. Tax charges are expected to hurt earnings in the range of $3.4-4 billion. Meanwhile, Shell sees the share of profit of joint ventures and associates to swell by $500-$700 million from storage transfer gains. Segment profit is also likely to include non-cash one-off gains between $800 million and $1 billion.Integrated GasShell’s LNG liquefaction volumes are expected in the range of 6.9-7.5 million tons, which translates into a deterioration of around 2.6% year over year and 6% sequentially. Shell’s integrated gas production is expected to decrease to the range of 890,000-940,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) or 915,000 BOE/d at the midpoint. It was 938,000 BOE/d in the third quarter of 2021 and 944,000 BOE/d in the June quarter. Per the company, third-quarter trading and optimization results in its integrated gas unit will be “significantly lower compared to the second quarter 2022” due to seasonality and market volatility.MarketingThe midpoint of management’s marketing sales volume guidance equates to 2.55 million barrels per day, higher than the 2.515 achieved in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, segment profits are expected to be above second-quarter levels, while indicating that operating expenses will be between $2 and $2.2 billion.Story continuesChemicals &amp; ProductsThe company fears that a drop in refining profitability is expected to bring down adjusted EBITDA from their second-quarter levels. As projected by Shell, the refining margin should considerably weaken in the third quarter, with the metric plunging 46% sequentially. The decrease would hurt product earnings by $1.2 billion at the midpoint of SHEL’s estimates. Similarly, negative margins in Shell’s chemicals-refining operations could take away $300 million to $600 million from third-quarter earnings, the company said. Shell also forecast refinery utilization of 86-90%, operating expense of 2.7-3.1 billion and chemicals manufacturing plant utilization of 75-79%.Renewables and Energy SolutionsThe adjusted bottom line of this segment is expected to hover between a loss of $300 million and a profit of $300 million.Q3 EstimatesThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, which consolidated its dual headquarters in London over The Hague and became a single United Kingdom (“UK”) entity earlier this year, is slated to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shell’s to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $3.03 per share.Other Energy PicksApart from Shell, investors interested in the energy sector might look at Cheniere Energy LNG and Valero Energy VLO.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.6%.Revenues are expected to be $80.72 billion, up 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.29% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth?For UnitedHealth, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that UnitedHealth will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of $5.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.57, delivering a surprise of +6.30%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.UnitedHealth appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

295,675d54a3-94a2-348d-953f-0df44ee54648,UNH,2022-10-08,Is Trending Stock UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-130001615.html,1665147601,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -1.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has gained 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.86 points to a change of +14.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.74 indicates a change of +13.2% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $80.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.6%. The $322.21 billion and $348.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12% and +8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%. EPS of $5.57 for the same period compares with $4.70 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $79.58 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.94%. The EPS surprise was +6.3%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Procter &amp; Gamble's (NYSE:PG) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Procter &amp; Gamble, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$19b ÷ (US$117b - US$33b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 22%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceIn the above chart we have measured Procter &amp; Gamble's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Procter &amp; Gamble here  for free.So How Is Procter &amp; Gamble's ROCE Trending?Procter &amp; Gamble has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 46% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Our Take On Procter &amp; Gamble's ROCETo bring it all together, Procter &amp; Gamble has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with a respectable 53% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble  that we think you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Dividend stocks are gaining popularity among investors as these stocks can potentially increase their portfolios’ returns. Due to the pandemic in 2020, many companies in the US cut their dividends due to weak earnings. Even so, dividend payments significantly accounted for overall returns. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, citing Bloomberg, the S&amp;P 500 companies that raised their dividends delivered a 12.7% return in 2020, compared with a 6.5% decline in the dividend cutters.The additional income earned through these dividends investments is beneficial for investors, especially in times of financial instability. This year, elite hedge funds are also growing bullish on high-dividend stocks as the market longs for yields due to growing inflation. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are mainly popular among investors as these companies have maintained decades-long dividend growth streaks, providing regular income to shareholders.Over the years, companies with strong dividend growth track records have performed well, outplaying their peers. Charles Schwab compiled Ned Davis Research’s data in its report on dividend investments. The report mentioned that companies that grew and initiated their dividends returned 13.74% from 1981 to 2020 versus a 10.3% return for the stocks that cut their dividends. The report also mentioned that reinvested dividends significantly increased overall S&amp;P 500 returns from 1990 to 2020.In the third quarter of 2022, dividend payments increased by $17.7 billion, compared with $17.6 billion in the previous quarter. Moreover, for the 12 months ending September 2022, US common dividend increases were $86.7 billion, up 20.7% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. In view of this, we will discuss high-dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Story continuesTop 13 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels Our Methodology:For this list, we used the data of 895 elite funds in Insider Monkey’s database as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 to select the most popular high-dividend stocks among these hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share for a dividend yield of 3.62%, as of October 6. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 11 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.In August, KGI Securities upgraded Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) is one of the best dividend stocks to consider.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”12.

It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”11. Broadcom Inc.

In Malaysia, for example, Broadcom has taken part in PIKAS, a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine, and roughly 73% fully vaccinated.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also initiated a position in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    Dividend Yield as of October 6: 3.02% Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a multinational pharmaceutical company that develops innovative medical solutions for patients with serious illnesses.

Baron Funds mentioned Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70    Dividend Yield as of October 6: 3.63% An American multinational pharmaceutical industry company, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is one of the best dividend stocks on our list due to its strong dividend history. The company was a part of 70 hedge fund portfolios in Q2 2022, down from 79 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds hold a collective value of over $2.8 billion. In September, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, in line with its previous dividend. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 12 years and its free cash flow generation signals future growth as well. As of October 6, the stock has a yield of 3.63%.

The company paid $4.5 billion in dividends to shareholders, which shows that its FCF is stable for shareholder returns. ClearBridge Investments mentioned Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend Stocks for Growth11 Cheap Healthcare Stocks To BuyTop 10 REIT Stocks Under $10Disclosure.

Here are some comments from the professor of finance at one of the top business schools in the world:“If you’re a long-term investor, I would absolutely buy now. I think these are absolutely great long-term values. Could it go down more? Of course in the short-run and in bear markets (historical), it has gone down more. But when you’re talking about 16 times earnings and even if they are clipped by a recession, you shouldn’t just base it on recession earnings you should base it on longer-term earnings, which I think are very favorable looking beyond the dip. I think these are just absolutely excellent values. Short-term, anything can happen in the short term.”While short-term investors are unwinding their positions and triggering major sell-offs, they are in fact creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces.

The majority of the world’s water is full of salt, frozen within snow or glaciers, or is contaminated or otherwise not fit for human consumption.The industry to convert water into a product fit for human consumption is quite a large one, and there are a lot of different ways to get exposure to the sector.

The firm offers industrial filtering, pumps, and flow solutions. it also has a swimming pool business, where it makes pool equipment and filters.The swimming pool business positively blasted off in popularity during the pandemic as people sought new ways to have fun and exercise at home. Understandably, investors are now concerned that swimming pool installations will plunge after 2021’s record run. That probably will happen.However, investors shouldn’t write off Pentair as simply a cyclical play on leisure dollars. The industrial business is a powerful one and is far less impacted by economic cycles. The need for clean water isn’t going anywhere, and Pentair will enjoy rising long-term demand in that market regardless of near-term swings in the pool business.PNR stock has dropped by more than 40% over the past year, pushing shares down to just 12 times forward earnings and making it one of the more affordable water stocks to buy.Story continuesXylem (XYL)xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) is a major player in the water infrastructure space. Instead of serving one niche, Xylem has built out a broad platform, aiming to be a one-stop shop for water equipment needs.Xylem supplies water measurement, infrastructure, storage, testing, and efficiency equipment among other goods.The basic idea is that a customer such as a water utility can buy everything it needs from Xylem instead of having to go a variety of different vendors for each product. This creates efficiencies of scale with sales and marketing.XYL stock tends to always be expensive, and that remains the case today. Shares were down more than 25% for the year at one point but have rebounded in recent weeks.That rally has picked up steam as the company’s recently announced Q3 earnings easily topped expectations and the company boosted guidance significantly.Unfortunately, shares are now going for more than 35 times forward earnings. However, if you want the leading water infrastructure company, Xylem is one of the best water stocks to own, and its past track record has been strong enough to justify paying a premium valuation for shares.Valmont Industries (VMI)Environmental technology concept. Picture of mountains with icons of infrastructure on top of it. Infrastructure stocks.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockValmont Industries (NYSE:VMI) is a little-known industrial conglomerate. Shares have produced a more than 3,000% gain over the past 30 years, with shares rising from $9 in 1992 to more than $320 today. Often niche players such as Valmont are able to put up surprisingly robust and long-lived outperformance.What has powered Valmont’s tremendous performance? It owns a variety of businesses. One primary one is in making fabricated poles for uses such as traffic, lighting, and cell phone towers. Another key division relates to water; Valmont makes a good deal of mechanical irrigation equipment and related water management solutions and technology.This is a key area of interest given geopolitical developments over the past year. Ukraine and Russia are both major grain producers, and it seems likely the ongoing war will greatly impact harvests from that region.As a result, the world needs to maximize its grain production from other leading agricultural zones. Valmont should see healthy demand for irrigation systems as a result.Ecolab (ECL)Ecolab (ECL) logo on its corporate headquarters building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comEcolab (NYSE:ECL) is the world’s largest provider of sanitation, hygiene and water treatment services globally. The company generated almost five times as much revenue as its closest rival, Diversey (NASDAQ:DSEY), last year.The company’s appeal is simple. A large consumer firm such as a fast food chain, cruise ship operator, or multinational hotel group takes out an all-in-one contract with Ecolab. Ecolab can provide that client with pest control, surface cleaning, specialty chemicals, and water treatment and efficiency.By contrast, that same restaurant or hotel would have to hire a bunch of different companies to provide those tasks on an individual basis. Ecolab’s focus on delivering water-saving solutions to customers has been particularly attractive as clients focus on reducing their ecological footprints while saving money.Ecolab’s business is heavily exposed to consumer discretionary spending. Thus, the pandemic crushed the business as many restaurants, hotels, airports and so on temporarily shut down. Now, however, as the world economy has reopened, business has come roaring back.Earnings are back up as the company has reported double-digit revenue growth again. That said, ECL stock is still far below its highs as investors worry about inflation and supply chain pressures on the company’s margins.Given Ecolab’s dominant market position, however, its only a matter of time until Ecolab shares return to their pre-pandemic levels.American Water Works (AWK)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockThere are a fairly large number of publicly traded American power utilities. For whatever reason, however, water utilities are much more likely to be held privately or by local governments.As a result, there are fewer than a dozen sizable publicly-traded water utility stocks in the United States today. Of these, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is among the largest. It provides water and wastewater services to more than 1,700 towns and municipalities across 14 states.Generally, water utilities, including AWK stock, have been rather expensive. American Water Works shares have traded as high as 40 times earnings at some points.With the current bear market, things have gotten a bit more reasonable. AWK stock is down more than 20% year-to-date, pushing the forward P/E ratio to 32. That might still seem expensive.However, it’s actually not bad for a company as consistent as American Water Works. Year in and year out, the company has higher revenues, higher profits, and raises its dividend. That consistency is worth a lot, especially in uncertain times such as the present.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Miniature house and symbols of public utilities.Source: Andrii Yalanskyi / ShutterstockEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is another large water utility. Until 2020, it was Aqua America and was a pureplay water operation. At that time, however, it bought People’s Gas which diversified the business. Regardless the gas unit is smaller than the prior Aqua America operations.The combined firm offers investors the promise of tremendous stability. Essential Utilities is a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning that it has increased its dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. The company’s focus on regulated utilities means cash flows are steady, which enable such a predictable and increasing dividend stream.The company has also found some growth opportunities in modernizing older water infrastructure. Given the water quality crises we’ve seen in cities such as Flint, there is increasing government focus on improving older infrastructure. Essential can play a role in updating these vital pipe and treatment facility networks while earnings a regulated return on capital for doing so.Global Water Resources (GWRS)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comDon’t let the name fool you, Global Water Resources (NASDAQ:GWRS) is a smaller utility that has a laser focus on just one state, Arizona. It is based out of a Phoenix suburb.Over the years, it has accumulated a wide service area in numerous towns and suburbs in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas.Arizona is a unique market in that its growth patterns encouraged the development of hundreds of tiny water utilities, each of which often service an area as small as one subdivision or small town. Recent regulatory changes have made it harder for small Arizona utilities to remain independent, thus causing a wave of consolidation. Global Water has acquired more than half a dozen other Arizona water utilities in recent years.This makes GWRS a strong growth stock within the typically staid utility industry. And Arizona itself is booming. Thanks to immigration and retirees moving to Phoenix for warm weather, Arizona has been one of the fastest-growing states in the country.More people means more water usage, and, in turn, more profitability for Global Water. In the meantime, the company also rewards shareholders with a monthly dividend which gives investors steady reliable income.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ECL, WTRG, and GWRS stock.

308,1e77e077-7a11-3b37-a173-cb7c3fa126df,PEP,2022-10-08,PepsiCo Earnings Preview: Should Investors be Thirsty for PEP Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-earnings-preview-investors-thirsty-235911963.html,1665187151,STORY,"['PEP', 'KO']","[Investors will get a taste of how PepsiCo PEP is handling the increasingly tough operating environment when it releases its third quarter FY22 financial results on Wednesday, October 12.While many businesses struggle during high inflationary periods, investors hope that PepsiCo can excel or at least shrug off the current economic downturn. PEP’s stock has performed considerably better than the broader market this year and may very well help investors fight inflation.PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola KO have historically been defensive hedges amidst economic uncertainty given their standing as consumer staples giants.Let’s take a look at what to expect from PEP’s Q3 earnings release to see how PepsiCo is performing during the economic uncertainty.Overview Trading roughly 10% from its highs, it will be important to see if consumers’ thirst for PepsiCo’s products continued during the third quarter. PepsiCo has also diversified its business to include complimentary brands like Frito Lay Snacks, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices, and Quaker foods.Last quarter PEP beat earnings expectations by 7% and sales remained stable despite consumers dealing with rising expenses such as gas. CEO Ramon Laguarta mentioned that while PepsiCo is concerned about rising inflation PEP had not seen a shift in consumer purchasing behavior.Performance PEP is only down -6% year to date, outperforming the S&amp;P 500’’s -22%, as investors look for stability amid market uncertainty. Although the S&amp;P 500’s +315% climb, beat PEP’s performance over the last 20 years, we can see from the nearby chart that PEP stock held up much better than the broader market during the financial crisis. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf we take the most recent five years of the 20-year chart and focus on the total return including dividends, we will see that PEP has outperformed the benchmark. PEP’s impressive +70% total return outpaced the S&amp;P 500’s +64%. This also crushed rival Coca-Cola’s +20% total return. PEP’s total return in the last year is +4%, which also topped the benchmark’s -16% and KO’s return is virtually flat.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlook The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP’s Q3 earnings is $1.84 a share, which would represent a 3% increase from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are also expected to be up 3% at $20.85 billion. Estimates for the period have mostly stayed the same over the past two months.Year over year, PEP is projected to post 6% earnings growth in 2022, with its FY23 earnings set to grow another 8%. Solid top line growth is also expected, with FY22 sales projected to rise 5% and another 3% in FY23 to $86.74 billion.PepsiCo is also expected to see 7.6% earnings growth over the next five years, which Is above Coca-Cola’s 6.4%.Valuation Trading around $162 a share, PEP has a forward P/E of 24.4X. This is lower than its high of 27.8X over the last decade and not too far from the median of 21.6X.PEP’s P/E is slightly higher than the industry average of 22.3X, which is on par with rival KO as well. However, investors have historically been willing to pay a premium for PEP compared to its industry.PEP’s cash flow per share of 8.1 is higher than the industry average of 0.5 and KO at 2.6. PepsiCo’s higher cash flow could certainly be important in the current economic downturn as operating costs could rise.Bottom Line PepsiCo’s third quarter earnings are much anticipated and will help investors get a clearer view of how consumer spending behavior has affected the company. This will also give insight into PEP’s stock being a potential hedge against inflation or if the current economic conditions have started to weigh on the company.PEP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Beverages-Soft Drinks Industry is in the bottom 32% of over 250 Zacks Industries. However, PEP’s 2.83% annual dividend yield at $4.60 a share helps investors add solid income as well.While PepsiCo’s dividend yield is lower than Coca-Cola’s 3.20% yield, the combination of a solid dividend along with its growth has helped the stock outperform its rival and the benchmark over the last five years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the time, preorders poured in from big-name players including Anheuser-Busch and Walmart, as well as PepsiCo—which reserved 100 trucks.

Tesla will deliver its first fleet of all-electric semi-trucks to PepsiCo by December 1, 2022Now roughly five years in the making, all fingers are crossed that the Semi doesn’t run into any more supply chain constraints ahead of its rollout.

PepsiCo has been aiming to reduce fuel costs and emissions, and reserved 100 of the trucks in 2017.U.S. companies have pledged to take action to reduce their impacts on the environment, with PepsiCo aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040.Transportation accounts for roughly 10% of the Mountain Dew maker's greenhouse gas emissions, PepsiCo's CEO, Ramon Laguarta, has said. Its company-owned fleet traveled 1.2 billion miles last year.Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced the start of production of the Semi truck late on Thursday on Twitter, saying the vehicles have a 500-mile (805 km) range and are ""super fun to drive.""Musk initially said the trucks would be in production by 2019 but the timeline has been delayed by years due to parts shortages.Other companies including United Parcel Service Inc, Walmart Canada and food service distributor Sysco Corp had also placed preorders for Tesla's Semi trucks.Walmart, UPS and Sysco did not respond to requests for comment on the status of their orders or delivery timings.Neither Musk nor Pepsi disclosed the number of Semis that would arrive at the packaged food company in December. On its website, PepsiCo said it expects 15 of its trucks to deploy by the end of this year.Tesla, on the other hand, has been struggling to deliver as many electric vehicles as it produces, which has hurt its share price.

Elon Musk says Tesla will deliver the first semi-truck ever to PepsiCo in December. Pepsi ordered 100 trucks in 2017 when production was expected to begin in 2019. And this is quite the truck. I remember when Tesla initially unveiled it. I believe it's supposed to get 500 miles on a full charge.It is a very-- it is a very intimidating-looking truck. But I think, really, it's going to give a good snapshot into what is possible with electric trucking and how much perhaps more infrastructure-- charging infrastructure we still need in this country. It's coming, but we still need it, and we need it now.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and this not to be confused with the Cybertruck that had a rock thrown at it and still had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunt, I believe it was, Pepsi, Walmart. They had some major purchase orders.

PepsiCo has been aiming to reduce fuel costs and emissions, and reserved 100 of the trucks in 2017.U.S. companies have pledged to take action to reduce their impacts on the environment, with PepsiCo aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040.Transportation accounts for roughly 10% of the Mountain Dew maker's greenhouse gas emissions, PepsiCo's CEO, Ramon Laguarta, has said. Its company-owned fleet traveled 1.2 billion miles last year.Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced the start of production of the Semi truck late on Thursday on Twitter, saying the vehicles have a 500-mile (805 km) range and are ""super fun to drive.""Musk initially said the trucks would be in production by 2019 but the timeline has been delayed by years due to parts shortages.Other companies including United Parcel Service Inc, Walmart Canada and food service distributor Sysco Corp had also placed preorders for Tesla's Semi trucks.Walmart, UPS and Sysco did not respond to requests for comment on the status of their orders or delivery timings.Neither Musk nor Pepsi disclosed the number of Semis that would arrive at the packaged food company in December. On its website, PepsiCo said it expects 15 of its trucks to deploy by the end of this year.Tesla, on the other hand, has been struggling to deliver as many electric vehicles as it produces, which has hurt its share price. Musk is also trying to close his $44 billion takeover of Twitter Inc, which has Tesla investors worried that the billionaire was spreading himself too thin.(Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru and Jessica DiNapoli in New YorkEditing by Arun Koyyur and Matthew Lewis)]"

317,e5171bc6-4db4-34eb-ac5b-bb652b1a5f67,UNP,2022-10-08,Union Pacific's (NYSE:UNP) investors will be pleased with their favorable 94% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacifics-nyse-unp-investors-130021473.html,1665147621,STORY,['UNP'],"[It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) share price down 13% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 74% in that time.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Union Pacific managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Union Pacific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Union Pacific's TSR for the last 5 years was 94%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Union Pacific shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 4.5% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 19%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.Cisco Systems' earnings growth of late has been pretty similar to most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the mediocre earnings performance to persist, which has held the P/E back. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this can at least be maintained so that you could pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems peKeen to find out how analysts think Cisco Systems' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Cisco Systems' Growth Trending?Cisco Systems' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 13% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 9.3% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 7.0% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.6% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's curious that Cisco Systems' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cisco Systems' P/EIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.We've established that Cisco Systems currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.A lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns, and go directly to read Top 5 High Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Dividend stocks are gaining popularity among investors as these stocks can potentially increase their portfolios’ returns. Due to the pandemic in 2020, many companies in the US cut their dividends due to weak earnings. Even so, dividend payments significantly accounted for overall returns. According to a report by S&amp;P Global, citing Bloomberg, the S&amp;P 500 companies that raised their dividends delivered a 12.7% return in 2020, compared with a 6.5% decline in the dividend cutters.The additional income earned through these dividends investments is beneficial for investors, especially in times of financial instability. This year, elite hedge funds are also growing bullish on high-dividend stocks as the market longs for yields due to growing inflation. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are mainly popular among investors as these companies have maintained decades-long dividend growth streaks, providing regular income to shareholders.Over the years, companies with strong dividend growth track records have performed well, outplaying their peers. Charles Schwab compiled Ned Davis Research’s data in its report on dividend investments. The report mentioned that companies that grew and initiated their dividends returned 13.74% from 1981 to 2020 versus a 10.3% return for the stocks that cut their dividends. The report also mentioned that reinvested dividends significantly increased overall S&amp;P 500 returns from 1990 to 2020.In the third quarter of 2022, dividend payments increased by $17.7 billion, compared with $17.6 billion in the previous quarter. Moreover, for the 12 months ending September 2022, US common dividend increases were $86.7 billion, up 20.7% from the same period last year, as reported by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”11. Broadcom Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”8. Pfizer Inc.

(NYSE:PFE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm had to say:“While the level of general turnover abated as we progressed through 2021, it remained high in one area: post-COVID-19 recovery plays. The concept behind this investment thesis was, and still is, straightforward: with the advent of effective vaccines, the path from pandemic to endemic is just a matter of time. As this transition occurs, the estimated excess savings of over $2 trillion built up on U.S. consumer balance sheets will unlock dramatic pent-up demand for experiences, especially global travel. This investment case seemed especially compelling when the Pfizer vaccine positively surprised markets in November 2020. As a result, we made post-COVID-19 stocks (which were trading well below our estimate of recovery value) a sizable theme within the portfolio. We understood this to be a more aggressive tilt in positioning because it required a major improvement in demand to catalyze fundamentals and drive price toward higher business values. While we accepted that recovery would not be smooth and that it would take time to deploy vaccines both domestically and globally, we decided that recovery was the logical path of least resistance and we were being well compensated for these risks.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019.
