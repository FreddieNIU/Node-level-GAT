It has amassed assets over $17.48 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap GrowthLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Further, growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.47%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk.

At TEAM, she served as the head of strategy and finance. She was successful in expanding the finance team after the company’s initial public offering.Lyft, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), may hope that Brewer brings all her experience into play and helps turn around its sagging fortunes.

SLCA recently announced the official launch of EverWhite Pigment, a newly developed high-white pigment for coatings, building materials and other applications. This highly specialized substance can be used to partly replace or complement other inorganic white pigments, such as Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) and Aluminum Trihydrate (ATH).The benefits of EverWhite Pigment include its hardness and endurance, which resemble the functionality of high-performing pigments like TiO2, its premium bright-white and consistent color formulations, and the fact that it is sourced locally. Customers can use it on quartz countertops, cementitious products, plastic fillers, coating formulas and a wide range of building products. EverWhite Pigment disperses more easily, the bright-white color retains its quality and the opacity flexibility aids in the product depth effect.EverWhite offers customers a great alternative to conventional inorganic white pigments.

CF has collaborated with CHS Inc. to accelerate quantifiable and certifiable greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in the agriculture and food systems by manufacturing and distributing low-carbon nitrogen fertilizer. This initiative was created as part of the United States-United Arab Emirates Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate program, which aims to drive global innovation in climate-smart agriculture.Fertilizer production, which is critical to crop yields, contributes significantly to the global food production lifecycle GHG footprint. To address food production's GHG footprint, both firms will capitalize on CF Industries' investments to manufacture ammonia, the building component of nitrogen-based fertilizer products, with lower Scope 1 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. They will also use CHS' vast distribution network to connect producers with low- and zero-carbon fertilizers. The companies are keen on working together to promote the use of low-GHG nitrogen fertilizer to assist farmers and crop end users, such as consumer product goods companies and ethanol manufacturers, in reducing agriculture's overall carbon footprint.A major advantage of incorporating decarbonized fertilizer is that it can quantify the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to its production and communicate this attribute to the farmer, who can then provide products with a quantifiably lower GHG footprint to their customers. This will enable the company to establish a certifiable decarbonized agricultural value chain, CF noted.Price PerformanceShares of CF have plunged 40.1% over the past year compared with the decline of 39.6% of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCF Industries noted on its first-quarter earnings call that it expects production economics in Europe to remain difficult. Full ammonia capacity production rates are not likely to restart in the region until 2023, with some plants still preferring to import ammonia in order to generate enhanced products.  CF forecasts urea exports from China to be 2-3 million metric tons for 2023 under current measures, with annual exports returning to 3-5 million metric tons if government export restrictions are lifted.Energy inequalities between North America and marginal producers in Europe and Asia are projected to be much greater than in the past.

The study looked at 2,405 patients who underwent TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve at 28 sites across seven European countries.With a focus on conscious sedation, recovery outside of the IC, and a target of next-day discharge, the Edwards Benchmark programme standardises a minimum approach to TAVR that unlocks the inherent advantages of the procedure's less intrusive nature while maintaining patient outcomes.Patients who underwent TAVR had ICU stays cut by 25% and median hospital stay reduced by 33%, while still maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes comparable to those of patients treated prior to the establishment of the Benchmark route. Researchers came to the conclusion that expanding the use of Benchmark best practises will increase the TAVR pathway's effectiveness without lowering patient safety.The trial results showed great patient satisfaction with all aspects of the Benchmark practises, scoring above 90% on post-procedure patient satisfaction surveys, in addition to a noticeable reduction in ICU stay and hospital stay with no loss of patient safety after 30 days.Significance of the StudyThe findings of this study confirm the value of the Edwards Benchmark programme for standardizing clinical pathways for patients undergoing TAVI (TAVR) in Europe. The findings show substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing patient safety.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Benchmark Registry adds to the expanding body of research that shows TAVR to be a triple-win procedure that not only improves patient quality of life but also lowers costs for the healthcare system. These results ought to reassure implanters that the Benchmark programme can assist TAVR centres to become more productive without compromising safety.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement market size was valued at $5,714.3 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 7.2% by 2030. The rising prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS), increasing demand for minimal-invasive procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and the growing geriatric population are driving the market.Recent DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Edwards Lifesciences presented new data from the COMMENCE aortic trial, demonstrating low rates of structural valve deterioration (SVD) in bioprosthetic aortic valves with the company's innovative RESILIA tissue. The latest COMMENCE aortic trial data emphasizes the value of RESILIA tissue-based offerings in helping patients and their physicians with lifetime management of valve disease.The company continues to advance  enrolment in the PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from the alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce the long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter based aortic valve interventions.In the United States, fourth quarter TAVR procedures grew in the mid-single-digit range.

12,76eafaba-5595-3737-8ae4-4edd2196e12c,RJF,2023-05-19,Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) shareholders have earned a 28% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financial-nyse-rjf-165850572.html,1684429130,STORY,['RJF'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE:RJF) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 23% in that time. But don't let that distract from the very nice return generated over three years. In fact, the company's share price bested the return of its market index in that time, posting a gain of 99%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Raymond James Financial achieved compound earnings per share growth of 20% per year. In comparison, the 26% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Raymond James Financial the TSR over the last 3 years was 108%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveRaymond James Financial shareholders are down 3.6% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 5.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Raymond James Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NYSE:RJF) fell 30.45%. On Nov. 10, 2022, it hit an all-time high of $123.98, and by the close on May 16, it was down to $86.22.Did something big occur? Did the diversified financial services company have something cataclysmic happen? Apparently, it was just Mr. Market on another one of his random walks.How do we know? Over the past three years, its average annual revenue growth rate was 12.50%, while earnings per share without non-recurring items grew by an average of 13.50% per year. However, earnings growth was bumpy over that period, which may have caused some investors to shy away.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with RJF. Click here to check it out. RJF 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RJFPeter Lynch Chart of RJFRaymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedPatient investors would have ridden out those ups and downs, but short-term investors and traders likely sold and bought the newest bright thing.But how much faith can we have in the patient investors? Are they wise or simply hanging on despite their losses?To begin, Raymond James is diversified and brings in revenue from several different segments:Raymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedIt also has a 61-year history in the financial industry, which means it can call on extensive experience when confronting new challenges.For many businesses, current short-term interest rates would be a challenge. But as Raymond James reported in recent earnings reports, it is a net beneficiary of these higher rates.It also claims in its 10-K for the year that ended Sept. 30, 2022 that it maintains a conservative, long-term focus in its decision-making. That suggests the company is less likely to make bad deals or pursue capital-destroying ideas.As this chart shows, its return on invested capital has been greater than its weighted average cost of capital every year for the past dozen years.Raymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedOverall, its fundamentals are reasonable, but not exciting. In part, that is due to a low financial strength ranking of 4 out of 10. In turn, that reflects the nature of its financial businesses.Story continuesRaymond James profitability is somewhat stronger at 7 out of 10. It has a net margin of 15.15%, a return on equity of 17.67% and has been profitable in each of the past 10 years.Revenue and earnings per share without NRI have grown at about an average rate for the capital markets industry over the past three years. Revenue has grown by an average of 12.50% per year, while earnings per share without NRI has averaged 13.50%.Similarly, its three-year book growth rate has averaged 10.90%.Acquisitions have supplemented organic growth, with Raymond James being an active buyer. In the annual report for 2022, it noted, As the firm marks 60 years, our commitment to augmenting organic growth with key strategic acquisitions continues as we welcome fixed income market maker, SumRidge Partners; banking and investment firm, TriState Capital; and U.K.-based wealth management firm, Charles Stanley.Of course, one of its sources of revenue is advising clients on their acquisitions and mergers.It currently pays a dividend yielding 1.75%, based on its May 17 price of $87.53. As the following chart shows, it has increased the dividend per share from 9 cents in 2013 to 42 cents this year.Raymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedAs for share repurchases, Raymond James has been on a bit of a roller coaster. Shares outstanding reached 224.10 million in 2018, fell to 208.95 million in 2020, went up to 220.70 million in 2022 and this year dropped back to 219.20 million.Overall, the numbers posted for profitability, growth and returns to shareholders paint a picture of a stable, growing company. It knows how to build its revenue, generate earnings and to return the non-growth portion of its profits to shareholders.How much would you have to pay to buy this package of current and future returns? At the moment, the share price lags both recent highs and its 10-year trendline.Raymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedThe GF Value Line assesses the current price as modestly undervalued. Based on historical multiples, a proprietary adjustment factor for previous returns and growth and future estimates, the GF Value is estimated at $107.72. Thats 23.06% higher than the current price of $87.53.Raymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedThe price-earnings ratio comes in at 11.53, which is below the industry average of 16.89. The PEG ratio, which is calculated by dividing the price-earnings ratio by the five-year Ebitda growth rate, is 1.05, which is at the bottom of the fair price range.Because Raymond James predictability ranking is high at five out of five stars, we can have confidence in the discounted cash flow forecast. It sees a 57.46% margin of safety.Raymond James: Solid, Profitable and UndervaluedThe consensus suggests the company is undervalued, likely between 23.06% and 57.46%.Nine gurus followed by GuruFocus had stakes in Raymond James at the end of the first calendar quarter, according to 13F filings. PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio) has a significant position of 12,836,557 shares, representing 6.06% of Raymond James shares outstanding and 1.04% of its own portfolio.Glenn Greenberg (Trades, Portfolio) of Brave Warrior Advisors had 2,176,510 shares and Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) of Fisher Asset Management held 532,022 shares.Institutional investors have invested heavily with 77.99% of shares outstanding. Insiders also hold a significant position with 7.69% of shares. The latter reflects the deep position of Thomas A. James, the chairman emeritus and son of founder Robert James. He owned 13,339,786 shares as of December 2016.Investors should be aware that 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.In conclusion, Raymond James Financial is a solid, profitable and growing company. It is also available at a discount, at least for now.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Our main focus is protecting our associates and customers, but also protecting our merchandise. This is not an issue that one retailer — or retailers at large — can solve themselves. We need engagement from the local communities to help solve this,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey said on Yahoo! Finance Live (video above).He was speaking after Walmart reported first-quarter same-store sales growth Thursday that beat expectations. It also raised its full-year earnings-per-share forecast.Rainey didn't share the financial impact the store is taking from inventory shrinkage, which is mostly from the theft of merchandise.But the fact it's happening may be attributed in part to increased economic stress among consumers, Rainey explained.Target did put a number around the problem, much to the shock of its investor base.The discounter estimated in its earnings release Wednesday that inventory shrinkage would clip profits by a whopping $500 million this year. Factoring in an about $700 million profit hit from the same cause in 2022, Target is on pace to see $1.2 billion go up in smoke, due primarily to organized retail crime.Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said the problem is getting worse, is nationwide, and across various merchandise departments.""The unfortunate fact is violent incidents are increasing at our stores and across the entire retail industry. And when products are stolen, simply put, they are no longer available for guests who depend on them,"" Cornell said on a call with reporters.""Left unchecked, organized retail crime degrades the communities we call home. As we work to address this problem, the safety of our guests and our team members will always be our primary concern. Beyond safety concerns, worsening shrink rates are putting significant pressure on our financial results,"" he said.Story continuesThe problem of organized retail crime has only grown worse in recent years, as thieves look to secure goods and sell them cheaper to consumers in an age of elevated inflation.Goods stolen from stores, which contributes to inventory shrinkage, led to $94.5 billion in losses in 2021, up from $90.8 billion in 2020, according to a late-2022 study by the National Retail Federation (NRF).About 32.8% of companies surveyed called out organized retail crime as becoming ""much more"" of a concern in the last five years.In a report released last month, an NRF analysis of 132 crime groups that conducted booster operations between 2014 and 2022 found that 16% used at least one violent tactic in stores. Those tactics include smash and grab, use of firearms or other weapons, battery, flash mob tactics, or threats of violence against store employees.The contentious situation has caused big retailers to vacate certain high-crime cities such as San Francisco in 2023.Nordstrom (JWN) recently followed Whole Foods in exiting a key location in San Francisco, citing concerns over worker safety.Independent news site The San Francisco Standard has tracked 20 closures of household-name stores in the city since 2010, including Office Depot.Target execs declined to say it would close stores to mitigate the profit impact of crime.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors Co. GM, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, Unum Group's UNM, MGM Resorts International MGM and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Value Stocks to Buy Amid Recession ThreatsWe are in the middle of a volatile May after a solid April. Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metrics raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained range-bound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.General Motors Co. has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM's strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.The forward P/E of General Motors for the current financial year is 4.61X, lower than the industry average of 9.84X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.47, lower than the industry average of 1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last seven days. United Airlines Holdings Inc. is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. Our second-quarter total revenue estimate indicates a 14.7% year-over-year increase.For second-quarter 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve almost 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. UAL's focus on cargo revenues is encouraging. UAL's fleet-upgrade efforts are commendable as well.The forward P/E of United Airlines for the current financial year is 4.16X, lower than the industry average of 9.74X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.09, lower than the industry average of 0.28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last 30 days. Unum Group's conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. Sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience. The geographic expansion of UNM is paying off as acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K.We believe strong operating results have led to a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, boosting financial flexibility. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders' value. For the long term, it estimates premiums from core business to increase 3-5%. UNM estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.The forward P/E of Unum for the current financial year is 8.67X, lower than the industry average of 11.75X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.81, lower than the industry average of 1.49. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last seven days.

The removal of COVID-related travel restrictions in Macau resulted in high contributions from the MGM China segment.MGM Resorts is also planning to expand its footprint in New York. MGM is optimistic regarding BetMGM operations as it anticipates revenue contributions of $1.8 -$2 billion in 2023.The forward P/E of MGM Resorts for the current financial year is 6.77X, lower than the industry average of 20.71X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.39, lower than the industry average of 2.12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. is likely to gain from expansions in the Permian Basin. The Sandbox and EP Minerals buyouts are also expected to make significant contributions.

24,32f4e284-53fd-3189-91b6-e7fb89857f5e,MET,2023-05-19,"Should You Be Concerned About MetLife, Inc.'s (NYSE:MET) ROE?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/concerned-metlife-inc-nyse-met-110050371.html,1684494050,STORY,['MET'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for MetLife How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for MetLife is:3.1% = US$1.0b ÷ US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.Does MetLife Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see MetLife has a lower ROE than the average (9.8%) in the Insurance industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for MetLife by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining MetLife's Debt And Its 3.1% Return On EquityMetLife does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 3.00. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

There's no denying a buy of that magnitude suggests conviction in a brighter future, although we do note that proportionally it only increased their holding by 6.6%. View our latest analysis for Callon Petroleum The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Callon PetroleumNotably, that recent purchase by Steven Webster is the biggest insider purchase of Callon Petroleum shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$32.48 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Callon Petroleum insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months Callon Petroleum insiders were buying shares, but not selling. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeCallon Petroleum is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Callon Petroleum insiders own about US$38m worth of shares. That equates to 1.9% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Callon Petroleum Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see recent purchasing. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Callon Petroleum we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Callon Petroleum you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Both contracts were set to add between 2% and 3% this week - their biggest weekly gain since early-April.Crude markets were cheered by the Biden administration signaling that it will begin refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as well as signs of increased U.S. fuel demand ahead of the summer season.But the outlook for oil markets still remained dismal, especially as weak economic data from China continued to trickle in. Softer-than-expected industrial production and retail sales readings released this week suggested that a post-COVID rebound in the country was stalling, which in turn cast doubts over China driving a recovery in oil demand this year.A stronger dollar also limited gains in crude markets, given that it makes commodities more expensive for overseas buyers. The dollar was boosted by a flurry of hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials this week, who warned that stubborn inflation was likely to keep rates higher for longer.An bigger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims furthered this notion on Thursday, driving the dollar to a near two-month high. Focus is now on a panel discussion involving Fed Chair Jerome Powell later on Friday, for any more cues on monetary policy.Fears of rising interest rates and slowing economic growth have been a key weight on oil prices this year, with markets fearing that a U.S. and potentially global recession will stymie crude demand.Story continuesCrude supplies in the world’s largest oil consumer also remained bloated, data showed this week, as U.S. inventories grew at their fastest pace in nearly three months in the week to May 12.Related ArticlesOil rises on debt ceiling optimism, set to snap 4-week losing spreeEU's Michel calls for 'stable and constructive' cooperation with ChinaU.S., Taiwan reach deal on first part of '21st Century' trade pact]"

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire David Tepper's 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.So, what would happen to the economy if America were to default? Well, the government borrows money to fund a variety of programs and functions such as salaries and healthcare spending. This funnels money into the economy and stimulates productivity for a variety of businesses. In case of a default, this spending stops and a large amount of money is removed from the economy. How large? According to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the event can cut up to ten percent of the American economy until the government figures out how to raise money. Perhaps ironically, a default also increases the risk premium that investors lending to the U.S. government demand for their money, which then spirals into higher costs of borrowing for the consumer (for instance for mortgages) and more interest payments that the government has to make on its debt. In broader terms, a Democratic Party think tank estimates that the economy can lose as many as three million jobs and a 30 year mortgage could cost an additional $130,000 to fund.Story continuesIn this turmoil, how does one invest? Well, it's important to look at what hedge funds are doing especially since talk of the debt ceiling had started to emerge since January. Fortunately for us, hedge fund filings for the first quarter of this year have started to become available and one fund that is on our radar is billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Mr. Tepper is one of the richest people in the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth at $18.5 billion as of May 2023. He set up the hedge fund in 1993 and since then it has grown to manage billions of dollars in funds, with our research suggesting a portfolio value of $1.8 billion as of Q1 2023. The billionaire has a business school named after him, and he started his career working in a steel company. Mr. Tepper's astute management at Goldman Sachs during the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash earned him laurels in the industry, as he bought debt that had dropped in value at the time but then recuperated the losses after the market recovered - resulting in gains for the investment bank.Today, we'll look at Mr. Tepper's top stock picks as the clouds of recession remain on the horizon and lawmakers wonder if a default will really be that bad. Some top picks of the billionaire are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

With CHAT, investors can gain exposure to this rapidly-evolving field, potentially benefiting from what we believe will be the exponential growth of generative AI technology.""Unlike other technological megatrends, generative AI has already begun to have significant real-world impact. OpenAI's ChatGPT has become the fastest application ever to reach 100 million users*, and its customers are already integrating its technology to improve their everyday lives for everything from creative writing to coding software.Our proprietary research assigns a total addressable market of ~$120 billion to enterprise generative AI software. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs research suggests artificial intelligence could drive $7 trillion in global economic growth over the next seven years as a result of accelerated productivity growth.Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses neural networks to generate new data that is similar in structure and format to existing data. Unlike other AI techniques that use existing data to make predictions or classifications, generative AI can create entirely new data that is original and unique. This is accomplished through the use of complex algorithms that learn to recognize patterns and relationships within large datasets, allowing the AI system to generate new content or ideas that are similar in style or format.Story continuesThe Roundhill Generative AI ETF (CHAT) is an actively-managed ETF that is designed to provide exposure to companies around the globe involved in generative AI and related technologies.CHAT's top holdings at launch include: Nvidia (7.8% weight), Microsoft (7.6% weight), Alphabet (7.2% weight), Baidu (5.4% weight), iFLYTEK (5.0% weight), Adobe (4.9% weight), AMD (4.9% weight), SenseTime Group (4.7% weight), C3.ai (4.5% weight) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM - 3.6% weight).""We had been hearing from investors for months that they were interested in investing in generative AI, but were frustrated by the lack of ETF options available to them.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the CHAT ETF please call 1-855-561-5728 or visit the website http://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/chat. Read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.The Fund expects to have concentrated (i.e., invest more than 25% of its net assets) investment exposure in one or more of the Technology Industries at any given time, which may vary over time. Further, the Fund expects to obtain such investment exposure by transacting primarily with a limited number of financial intermediaries conducting business in the same industry or group of related industries. As a result, the Fund is more vulnerable to adverse market, economic, regulatory, political or other developments affecting those industries or groups of related industries than a fund that invests its assets in a more diversified manner. The value of stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Fund.Artificial Intelligence Company Risk. Companies involved in, or exposed to, artificial intelligence related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel.Technology Sector Risk. The Fund will invest substantially in companies in the information technology sector, and therefore the performance of the Fund could be negatively impacted by events affecting this sector.Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies.Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ""non-diversified,"" it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.Concentration Risk. The Fund will be concentrated in securities of issuers having their principal business activities in the technology group of industries.CHAT is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/roundhill-investments-launches-generative-ai--technology-etf-nyse-arca-chat-301828049.htmlSOURCE Roundhill Investments]"
40,f07dbf41-8cbc-33e6-8a89-684ea1a688df,CRM,2023-05-19,Those who invested in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) five years ago are up 63%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-salesforce-nyse-crm-130036003.html,1684328436,STORY,['CRM'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Salesforce share price has climbed 63% in five years, easily topping the market return of 43% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 25% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Salesforce To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Salesforce's earnings per share are down 16% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.In contrast revenue growth of 22% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Salesforce is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthSalesforce is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Salesforce will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Salesforce shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 10% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Salesforce better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Salesforce has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course Salesforce may not be the best stock to buy.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 5.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share, indicating a change of +64.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.76 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

42,69e7351f-1c16-3898-bd46-0f8c8db44451,FLS,2023-05-19,Flowserve Corporation's (NYSE:FLS) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flowserve-corporations-nyse-fls-fundamentals-132734767.html,1684416454,STORY,['FLS'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Flowserve's (NYSE:FLS) recent performance, when its stock has declined 3.7% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Flowserve's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Flowserve How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Flowserve is:13% = US$242m ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Flowserve's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo begin with, Flowserve seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This certainly adds some context to Flowserve's moderate 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Flowserve's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 8.3% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is FLS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether FLS is currently mispriced by the market.Is Flowserve Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 70% (or a retention ratio of 30%) for Flowserve suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Flowserve has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 32% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Flowserve's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

43,916fd26d-45b3-3e26-92c7-747b1d68b22e,RL,2023-05-19,Ralph Lauren (RL) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-earnings-expected-140002772.html,1684418402,STORY,['RL'],"[The market expects Ralph Lauren (RL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis upscale clothing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.47 billion, down 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ralph Lauren?For Ralph Lauren, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ralph Lauren will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ralph Lauren would post earnings of $2.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.35, delivering a surprise of +15.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ralph Lauren doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, Guess (GES) is soon expected to post loss of $0.28 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -216.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $555.46 million, down 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Guess has been revised 0.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 9.09%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Guess will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If your graduation celebration involves balloons, make sure they are secured with a weight. Otherwise they can float away and come into contact with overhead power lines, causing a public safety risk.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)In the first four months of 2023, metallic balloons striking electric lines have caused 91 power outages in PG&amp;E's service area, disrupting service to more than 35,000 customers. These power outages can interrupt electric service to critical facilities such as hospitals, schools and traffic lights.""Graduation season is a happy time for California students and families, filled with school commencements and celebrations. But the mass balloon releases we often see at graduation ceremonies can quickly put a damper on the fun. When metallic balloons make contact with power lines, they can cause widespread power outages. We urge everyone to celebrate responsibly and secure metallic balloons with a weight,"" said Aaron Johnson, Vice President for PG&amp;E's Bay Area Region.Metallic balloons have a silvery coating, which is a conductor for electricity. If the balloons float away and make contact with power lines, they can short transformers, cause power outages and melt electrical wires, causing public safety risks. A few years ago, more than 6,000 San Francisco customers were without power after metallic balloons released during a graduation ceremony came into contact with overhead power lines. PG&amp;E tends to see an increase in balloon-caused outages during graduation season.To help ensure that graduation balloon celebrations are enjoyed responsibly, PG&amp;E reminds customers to follow these important balloon safety tips:Story continues""Look Up and Live!"" Use caution and avoid celebrating with metallic balloons near overhead electric lines.Make sure helium-filled metallic balloons are securely tied to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from floating away. Never remove the weight.When possible, keep metallic balloons indoors. Never permit metallic balloons to be released outside, for everyone's safety.Do not bundle metallic balloons together.Never attempt to retrieve any type of balloon, kite or toy that becomes caught in a power line. Leave it alone, and immediately call PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5000 to report the problem.Never go near a power line that has fallen to the ground or is dangling in the air. Always assume downed electric lines are energized and extremely dangerous. Stay far away, keep others away and immediately call 911 to alert the police and fire departments.

You just need to know where to look.Tech stocks are attractive because they represent companies on the cutting edge of innovation. The companies representing tech stocks are developing and manufacturing software, hardware, semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. Some are involved in technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning.These companies are revolutionary, and it’s fun and profitable to be on the ground floor for life-changing innovation. It also means that tech stocks can be highly volatile, so they aren’t for every investor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI enjoy using the Portfolio Grader to weed out the bad stocks and find top-rated tech stocks with the greatest growth potential.

FSLR stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is at the forefront of harnessing green energy to support the power grid rather than relying on fossil fuels. Companies like First Solar are getting an added boost from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in Washington.The law encourages the development of green technologies by providing $10 billion in new tax credits.BloombergNEF’s latest Clean Energy Outlook report says the Inflation Reduction Act will help green energy companies create 356 gigawatts of new solar capacity by 2030, pushing the nation’s total annual capacity to more than 600 GW. That would be enough power for 660 million homes.First Solar is rapidly expanding, spending $1.2 billion to scale production of its photovoltaic solar modules. It announced last week that it’s buying Evolar AB, a Swedish maker of a thin film for solar panels, for $80 million.Story continuesFSLR stock is up 53% this year and has an “A” rating from the Portfolio Grader.Arista Networks (ANET)Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) develops, markets and sells cloud networking solutions. It claims more than 7,000 cloud customers around the world.Its Arista EOS (Extensible Operating System) helps customers build and manage large-scale networks. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create software products and management tools that help customers automate their businesses and provides security.Earnings for the first quarter included revenue of $1.35 billion, a 54% increase from a year ago, an EPS of $1.43 beat analysts’ expectations for $1.35.ANET stock is up 14% in 2023 and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.National Instruments (NATI)APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.Source: ShutterstockNational Instruments (NASDAQ:NATI) provides software and hardware products for engineers, helping them design and deploy measurement and automation systems.It operates in the aerospace, defense, semiconductor and transportation spaces. Its top product, LabVIEW, helps users create custom applications for data acquisition, instrument control and analysis.Revenue in the first quarter set a record high of $437 million for the company, up 13% from a year ago.But the most interesting thing about National Instruments is a pending deal with Emerson (NYSE:EMR) that would see the latter buy NI for $8.2 billion.The deal, which values NATI stock at $60, is expected to close in the first half of Emerson’s fiscal 2024 year.Emerson must also complete its sale of Climate Technologies to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) in an $8 billion deal. So there are still some hoops to jump through.There’s only about a 3% profit if you get a new position in NATI stock. But if the economy crumples as some believe it will and NI’s stock price falls, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to pick up some shares for a bit of security when you cash in next year.NATI stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Motorola Solutions (MSI)Motorola smartphones are shown on display in electronic store. The brand logo is in the background.Source: N.Z.Photography / ShutterstockFor a company nearly 100 years old, Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) is doing an excellent job of staying on the cutting edge of new technology.The company was first in the business of making car radios. Now it produces two-way radios, mobile devices and software most often used by law enforcement and first responders.It recently won new contracts to support the city of Chicago, the U.S. Air Force and Portugal’s public safety communications network.Revenue in the first quarter was $2.17 billion, up 14.7% from a year ago, as the company reported strong demand for command center software, video security and land mobile radio devices.Net non-GAAP earnings were $2.22 per share, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.08.And the profits should continue. Motorola said it ended the first quarter with a record backlog of $14.1 billion, up 5% from a year ago.MSI stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Super Micro Computer (SMCI)a man working on a computer hard driveSource: ShutterstockCalifornia-based Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) doesn’t have the most original name. But the company has some creative solutions for the IT industry. Supermicro sells server systems, motherboards, power supplies, networking equipment and more.One factor that rates highly in the Portfolio Grader’s rankings is momentum – and few stocks are showing as much positive momentum as Supermicro right now.The company’s stock price is up 63% this year and 172% in the last 12 months.Earnings for the company’s fiscal third quarter of 2023 aligned with expectations—revenue of $1.28 billion and earnings of $1.63 per share. Revenue decreased slightly from last year, but EPS rose about 5%.However, the company’s stock price jumped by 28% when SMCI forecasted fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.8 billion and EPS of $2.46. That was much higher than Wall Street’s expectations for $1.64 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.76.As long as the momentum and strong earnings remain, SMCI stock will continue to get a solid rating from the Portfolio Grader. Currently, it has an “A” rating.Array Technologies (ARRY)Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.Source: ShutterstockArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) is another way to play solar energy. But unlike First Solar that makes solar panels, Array helps solar panels work better.The company creates the solar tracker technology and machinery needed to position solar panels throughout the day so they’re following the sun. As interest in solar energy continues to grow, Array will have a broader market to develop.Earnings for the first quarter were a blowout win. Revenue of $376.7 million was 25% better than a year ago and beat analysts’ expectations of $322.8 million. Earnings of 25% per share were much better than Wall Street’s expected 4 cents per share.ARRY stock is up 13% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Axcelis Technologies (ACLS)Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comMuch as Array helps solar panels work better, Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) helps semiconductor chips work more efficiently.Its next-generation Purion platform uses an ion implanter technology in the chip fabrication process, letting manufacturers create better chips with fewer errors in the production process.Semiconductors are becoming more of a part of our daily lives. As our reliance on semiconductors increases, Axcelis will be a more significant part of tomorrow’s infrastructure.

Unlike Gen Z's steady growth in the labor market, representation from Baby Boomers, Gen X (born 1965-1980), and Millennials (born 1981-1996) continues to decline. The data for the report was derived from Paychex payroll data as of April 2023.""Our data clearly supports the fact that the workforce composition is shifting as more Gen Z members seek full-time and long-term roles, more members of Gen X begin to retire, and Millennials enter their prime earning years,"" said Frank Fiorille, Paychex VP of risk, compliance, and data analytics. ""Considering these facts, employers need to develop recruiting and retention strategies that keep Gen Z at the forefront, appealing to their values-based approach and celebrating the unique contributions this group brings to the table.""Other key insights from the Paychex report include:Gen Z females are working more than their male counterparts. The Gen Z workforce is comprised of 53% females and 47% males. Gen Z females represent 20.5% of all female workers, while Gen Z males only represent 17.7% of all male workers. Furthermore, Gen Z females represent a larger share of their gender's workforce compared to males in every industry except Construction.Gen Z workers are most common in leisure and hospitality. Making up 37.2% of the total small business workforce in Leisure and Hospitality, Gen Z is not only overrepresented relative to the national average but is the generation with the highest representation in the sector.Wages for Gen Z are low, but they're rapidly growing. Hourly earnings growth for Gen Z (9.3%) is more than double the national average (4.5%), largely due to the generation's lower-than-average wages ($19.79 per hour).Gen Z is making strides to close the gender pay gap. The pay gap between male ($20.82/hour) and female employees ($18.82/hour) in Gen Z is $2.00 compared to $6.74 across all generations. Notably, Leisure and Hospitality is the only industry in which female ($17.65/hour) Gen Z employees make more than their male ($17.57/hour) counterparts, by a slim margin of $0.08/hour.

It also provides for the mutually exclusive rights for ADM and Air Protein to collaborate to build and operate the world’s first Air Protein commercial scale plant.""Food security and sustainability are two of the enduring trends driving the growth and evolution of protein demand, and ADM is at the forefront of expanding the entire protein ecosystem,"" said Ian Pinner, ADM’s senior vice president, Strategy and Innovation. ""We are proud to be a strategic investor in Air Protein, and with today’s agreement, we’re expanding our partnership to bring ADM’s industry-leading expertise in flavors and complete nutrition solutions to help expand the universe of applications in which Air Protein’s technology can be used. To sustainably feed a growing global population, we need a broad protein ecosystem, from animal to plant to other novel sources. ADM is proud to work with both startups and major consumer brands to leverage our full pantry of capabilities and expand opportunities that innovative technologies present.""Prior to entering the SDA, ADM has served as a strong supporter of Air Protein through investment of Series A and SAFE funding, and along with others including the Ford Foundation, Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital, Plum Alley, and GV (formerly Google Ventures), Air Protein has raised $107 million in cumulative capital.

Our first Air Farm facility, located in San Leandro, CA, will serve as a prototype for the protein farm of the future. The state-of-the-art facility demonstrates the making of protein and other ingredients using air, water and energy as inputs. Air Protein makes protein ingredients that are rich in vitamins and minerals, flavor proteins, color proteins, and functional proteins that can deliver on a range of texture applications. The dramatic difference between Air Protein’s landless agriculture platform and all other ways of making protein is that others depend on land and/or an agricultural supply chain. This improves both the competitiveness and stability of production costs as it enables protein production without traditional supply chain risks (climate, geopolitical, etc.). At Air Protein, our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to rainforest-friendly food to sustainably feed the future.Source: Corporate ReleaseSource: ADMView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230518005171/en/ContactsADMJackie Andersonmedia@adm.com 312-634-8484Air ProteinDavid Schutzmandavid@schutzmanpr.com (203) 550-8551]"

But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. That's what has happened with the Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) share price. It's up 31% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 8.5% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Philip Morris International achieved compound earnings per share growth of 4.5% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Philip Morris International's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Philip Morris International the TSR over the last 3 years was 55%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePhilip Morris International shareholders are down 3.5% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.9%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Philip Morris International better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Philip Morris International (at least 2 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: Philip Morris International may not be the best stock to buy.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire David Tepper's 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.So, what would happen to the economy if America were to default? Well, the government borrows money to fund a variety of programs and functions such as salaries and healthcare spending. This funnels money into the economy and stimulates productivity for a variety of businesses. In case of a default, this spending stops and a large amount of money is removed from the economy. How large? According to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the event can cut up to ten percent of the American economy until the government figures out how to raise money. Perhaps ironically, a default also increases the risk premium that investors lending to the U.S. government demand for their money, which then spirals into higher costs of borrowing for the consumer (for instance for mortgages) and more interest payments that the government has to make on its debt. In broader terms, a Democratic Party think tank estimates that the economy can lose as many as three million jobs and a 30 year mortgage could cost an additional $130,000 to fund.Story continuesIn this turmoil, how does one invest? Well, it's important to look at what hedge funds are doing especially since talk of the debt ceiling had started to emerge since January. Fortunately for us, hedge fund filings for the first quarter of this year have started to become available and one fund that is on our radar is billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Mr. Tepper is one of the richest people in the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth at $18.5 billion as of May 2023. He set up the hedge fund in 1993 and since then it has grown to manage billions of dollars in funds, with our research suggesting a portfolio value of $1.8 billion as of Q1 2023. The billionaire has a business school named after him, and he started his career working in a steel company. Mr. Tepper's astute management at Goldman Sachs during the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash earned him laurels in the industry, as he bought debt that had dropped in value at the time but then recuperated the losses after the market recovered - resulting in gains for the investment bank.Today, we'll look at Mr. Tepper's top stock picks as the clouds of recession remain on the horizon and lawmakers wonder if a default will really be that bad. Some top picks of the billionaire are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

Cangrejos is expected to be a high-margin mine with a life expectancy of 26 years and has strong exploration potential. This deal thus adds to WPM’s portfolio of high-quality, low-cost assets.The Cangrejos project is fully owned by Vancouver, Canada-based Lumina Gold Corp., which is a precious and base metals exploration and development company. Lumina has been working to de-risk the project and advance it toward construction. Attributable annual production from the project is expected to be around 24,000 ounces of gold for the first ten years. It is projected to be more than 24,500 ounces of gold per year for the life of the mine. As per Lumina Gold’s preliminary feasibility study, Cangrejos is the 26th largest primary gold asset in the world.Wheaton will purchase 6.6% of the payable gold from the project until 700,000 ounces of gold have been delivered. Once this level is achieved, the stream will be reduced to 4.4% of the payable gold production for the life of the mine.  The addition of the stream will increase WPM’s total estimated proven and probable gold reserves by 0.76 million ounces, measured and indicated gold resources by 0.25 million ounces and inferred gold resources by 0.16 million ounces.Wheaton International will pay Lumina an upfront cash consideration of $300 million, of which $48 million is available pre-construction. Wheaton International will make ongoing payments for the gold ounces delivered, equal to 18% of the spot price of gold until the uncredited deposit is reduced to nil and 22.0% of the spot price of gold thereafter.As of Mar 31, 2023, Wheaton Precious had approximately $800 million of cash on hand. This, combined with the liquidity provided by the available credit under the $2 billion revolving term loan and ongoing operating cash flows, positions the company well to fund the acquisition of the Cangrejos gold stream and fulfill all outstanding commitments and known contingencies. It also provides flexibility to acquire other lucrative mineral stream interests.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of Wheaton have gained 18.9% in the past year against the industry’s 16.5% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderWheaton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Gold Fields Limited GFI, PPG Industries, Inc.

(NYSE:PPG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.75bUS$1.78bUS$1.99bUS$2.17bUS$2.31bUS$2.43bUS$2.53bUS$2.61bUS$2.70bUS$2.77bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x13Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.92%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.49%Est @ 3.07%Est @ 2.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$21bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$36b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$142, the company appears about fair value at a 6.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PPG Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.023. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PPG IndustriesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PPG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.22, while GVDNY has a forward P/E of 32.99. We also note that PPG has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. GVDNY currently has a PEG ratio of 3.52.Another notable valuation metric for PPG is its P/B ratio of 4.52. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerThe Executive Vice President of Core Services &amp; Equipment, Abdellah Merad, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$57.20 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$43.25. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Schlumberger better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Schlumberger Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Schlumberger. In total, insiders sold US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of SchlumbergerAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$142m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Schlumberger Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Schlumberger stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Schlumberger is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Schlumberger you should know about.But note: Schlumberger may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

75,25c7a491-6259-3769-8089-1a76610869dd,AIG,2023-05-19,Buy These 5 Low Price-to-Sales Stocks for a Sparkling Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-low-price-sales-145502875.html,1684421702,STORY,"['KBH', 'AIG', 'PAM', 'MT']","[Investment in stocks after the analysis of the valuation metrics is considered one of the best practices. When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profit.What’s Price-to-Sales Ratio?While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. Therefore, a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Barnes Group Inc. B, American International Group AIG, ArcelorMittal MT, KB Home KBH and Pampa Energia S.A. PAM are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Barnes is a global diversified manufacturer and provider of highly engineered products, innovative solutions, and differentiated industrial technologies.

The application uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret bacterial growth and release negative specimens with minimal human interaction.The AI-based imaging application is backed by the BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II screening plates and powered by BD Synapsys Informatics Solution. The application can be used with both standalone BD Kiestra ReadA systems and track-based BD Kiestra laboratory automation solutions.The latest regulatory approval is expected to solidify BD’s foothold in the global Diagnostics business, thereby boosting its overall Life Sciences segment.Significance of the ApprovalPer the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MRSA in hospital settings may cause severe problems, including blood stream or surgical-site infections, sepsis and even death. As performing a lab test is the only way to determine if a particular kind of infection is caused by MRSA, the ability to run these tests efficiently and effectively may have a significant impact on patient treatment.The BD Kiestra MRSA application uses AI to automate the traditional labor and time-intensive task of inspecting Petri dishes to determine the presence or absence of bacterial growth. This will likely enable medical laboratory scientists and technicians to focus more on higher-value analysis. The application is also expected to assess single specimens or group together the large volume of plates with non-significant growth for batch review and release of negative results. This, in turn, may help reduce the administrative burden on technicians.The MRSA imaging application uses AI algorithms to look for specific culture characteristics on the BBL CHROMagar MRSA II plate. Based on that information and analysis by BD Synapsys informatics, the plate images are automatically organized and sorted into meaningful worklists for laboratory scientists and technicians.Story continuesPer management, the pandemic led to significant and ongoing labor challenges in laboratories. Management believes that since reading plates is a labor-intense and potentially error-prone process in microbiology, the use of the imaging application to automatically organize specimens in meaningful worklists may help use limited laboratory staff more efficiently. It will likely allow lab personnel to concentrate on more critical and complex specimens.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global molecular diagnostics market is anticipated to reach $30.2 billion by 2027 from $23.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Factors like the emergence of new viruses, technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and the growing awareness of early disease diagnosis are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Recent Developments in Life Sciences ArmThis month, BD announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it recorded solid top-line and bottom-line results and improvements in the overall base revenues. Robust performances by both geographic regions were also seen. The BD Life Sciences segment’s Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business unit saw growth in Microbiology. The Biosciences business unit also registered continued double-digit growth in Research Reagents.In March, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the BD Vaginal Panel on the BD COR System.In February, BD received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test.Price PerformanceShares of BD have gained 0.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 10.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 6.9% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, BD carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The company’s Mental Health business witnessed a record number of GeneSight tests in the first quarter, with nearly 4,000 clinicians ordering the test for the first time.Excluding contributions from the Gateway Genomics acquisition, prenatal testing volumes grew 12% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The quarterly figure includes minimal contributions from California due to ongoing disruptions caused by the state's revised prenatal screening program.New Partnerships Appear Promising: Myriad Genetics announced several new strategic partnerships in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesIn March, the company expanded its partnership with Illumina to increase the access and availability of oncology homologous recombination deficiency testing in the United States.Last month, Myriad Genetics announced a collaboration with SimonMed Imaging — one of the largest independent outpatient imaging providers in the United States. The program is expected to enable affordable access to genetic testing and deliver personalized insights to better inform clinical decisions for millions of potential patients.On the first-quarter earnings call, MYGN mentioned that it has entered into a partnership with ClinVar at the request of the company’s providers.Strength in Commercial Capabilities: Throughout last year, Myriad Genetics made good progress in its commercial execution, resulting in robust volume growth in the last two quarters.

And you see the stock getting a big lift on the back of those numbers, up about 9%.We were kind of asking questions yesterday, Seana, going into the upfronts for Netflix about just how significant that ad pool was going to be for them. This is the first time they've given us a number here, investors certainly liking that in a big way, even in this environment, where we have seen a big pullback in ad dollars.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly, we're looking at the biggest gain for this stock since October. Netflix clearly did impress with the numbers that they put up with the plans that they do have for their ad tier. And something that investors have been waiting for, investors have been betting on-- the success of this. And they really came through and proved that with their upfront presentation there, the excitement about that, JP Morgan reiterating their overweight rating.Another nugget to point out here-- more than a quarter of the new sign-ups chose the ad plan in regions where that was available-- so certainly a welcome sign there for Netflix that has been struggling to grow their subscriber base.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. Paul Tudor Jones is one of the richest people in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, his current net worth sits at a cool $7.5 billion - making him rank among the top three hundred richest people in the world today. Like a lot of other billionaires and centi-millionaires, he attributes this unthinkable fortune to the world of investing. Mr. Jones set up the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 and since then his fund has grown to have a portfolio worth a whopping $6.4 billion as of March 2023.Mr. Jones's entry into the investment world provided him with the perfect skill set to play the market conditions that have been in place for more than twelve months now. He started his career by trading cotton futures on the New York Stock Exchange - which provided him an opportunity to gain experience in trading commodities. A couple of years later he would set up his own hedge fund and its first investment would come from a commodities trading firm. He rose to fame in 1987, when he understood that a stock market crash was coming. This manifested itself in the form of the Black Monday crash of 1987, and the short bets that he placed enabled Tudor Investment to mark a whopping 200% gain while others bled losses.A couple of years later, Mr. Jones's genius would make its mark again when he would profit by holding options that enabled him to sell shares at high prices when they were plummeting during a stock market crash. His hedge fund leverages the experience that Mr. Jones gained during his earliest days in the financial market, and these days it focuses primarily on discretionary macro trading. This strategy takes a broader look at the global macroeconomic environment and crafts trading strategies accordingly. As you're likely aware, the global commodities market was upended last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook oil prices and created grain shortages.Story continuesThis enabled Tudor Investment to take a crucial role in the market and once again make its market in a tumultuous environment. While there's little data available on how well the hedge fund performed last year, we can get a semblance of its fortune by taking a look at the portfolio size. Insider Monkey's research shows that Tudor Investment's portfolio was worth $6.5 billion as of March 2023. This marks a 30% growth since the fourth quarter of last year when the portfolio had stood at $5 billion. The portfolio was worth $4.2 billion in Q1 2022, enabling the latest figures to mark a whopping 55% gain. Looking at this, it appears as if Mr. Jones is definitely doing something right even as the stock market recovers from another historic bloodbath in less than five years.Jones has made some interesting statements recently which should be crucial for anyone looking to invest in the stock market. However, before we get to this, a brief stock of the current macroeconomic conditions is warranted. The Federal Reserve has been on an aggressive interest rate hiking spree to control inflation. This makes doing business harder and that is precisely the effect the Fed aims to have since lower output means a slower economy and in effect lower spending to usher in lower prices. The consequence of this is a potential recession, but the Fed chairman Jerome Powell believes that this might not be the case as he recently stated:So I think that—I think it’s still possible. I—you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession. But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out, either. It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.However, Mr. Jones begs to differ from Chairman Powell. In a fresh interview given in May 2023, he outlined thatThen we have, in a more intermediate basis, we have the financial cycle. The financial cycle, which is what we kind of look at internally, is the combination of the historical debt and asset valuation boom-bust. So if you think about post covid, we had this massive increase in debt. Massive increase in equity valuation. It creates this boom in the financial cycle, that's happened in 1990, that happened in 2000. That happened 2008. Our financial cycle, the peak of total debt growth plus stock market valuation occurred in September of 2021. Historically, it's about a two year lag, when that really really bites and you go into recession. That would be third quarter this year; there's a good chance based on our most recent financial episodes, there's a really good chance that we're going to be on the verge of looking like, or, actually going into recession.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top stocks that were on Mr. Jones's mind as he headed into what might be a recession year. Some top picks are Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor JonesOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best stocks to buy according to Paul Tudor Jones, we used his hedge fund's filings for the first quarter of 2023 with the SEC to sift out those stocks that had the largest investment in dollar terms.Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones10.

At issue was whether a valid patent can cover all the members of an identified group, or if it is limited to only those members of the group specified by the patent owner.In 2014, Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron for patent infringement over their rival drug Praluent, which works by a similar mechanism as Repatha. Both drugs use laboratory-made antibodies to block a protein called PCSK9 that inhibits the removal of bad cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve this result through different chemical combinations.Bad cholesterol, known LDL, can cause a buildup of plaque in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.Amgen sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of Repatha worldwide in 2022.

It argued that a patent need only to ""enable skilled artisans to 'make and use' the invention,"" not account for the full range of possible forms the invention might take.The justices said that Supreme Court precedent weighed against Amgen.""For if our cases teach anything,"" Gorsuch wrote, ""it is that the more a party claims, the broader the monopoly it demands, the more it must enable.""During arguments in the case in March, Amgen faced tough questions from the justices about why its patents described 26 specific examples of antibodies when the scope of its patents would cover a larger number.Sanofi urged the justices to affirm the Federal Circuit's ruling, characterizing Amgen's bid as ""a blatant attempt to corner the market"" for cholesterol-lowering drugs.President Joe Biden's administration, arguing in support of Sanofi, told the justices that Amgen had not disclosed the information needed to make to make its patents valid.(Reporting by John Kruzel; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.1% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 6.9% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Public Service Enterprise Group which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Public Service Enterprise Group. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Public Service Enterprise Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Public Service Enterprise Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Public Service Enterprise Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Public Service Enterprise Group. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. With 9.0% and 6.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Public Service Enterprise GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$43m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Public Service Enterprise Group (at least 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire David Tepper's 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.So, what would happen to the economy if America were to default? Well, the government borrows money to fund a variety of programs and functions such as salaries and healthcare spending. This funnels money into the economy and stimulates productivity for a variety of businesses. In case of a default, this spending stops and a large amount of money is removed from the economy. How large? According to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the event can cut up to ten percent of the American economy until the government figures out how to raise money. Perhaps ironically, a default also increases the risk premium that investors lending to the U.S. government demand for their money, which then spirals into higher costs of borrowing for the consumer (for instance for mortgages) and more interest payments that the government has to make on its debt. In broader terms, a Democratic Party think tank estimates that the economy can lose as many as three million jobs and a 30 year mortgage could cost an additional $130,000 to fund.Story continuesIn this turmoil, how does one invest? Well, it's important to look at what hedge funds are doing especially since talk of the debt ceiling had started to emerge since January. Fortunately for us, hedge fund filings for the first quarter of this year have started to become available and one fund that is on our radar is billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Mr. Tepper is one of the richest people in the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth at $18.5 billion as of May 2023. He set up the hedge fund in 1993 and since then it has grown to manage billions of dollars in funds, with our research suggesting a portfolio value of $1.8 billion as of Q1 2023. The billionaire has a business school named after him, and he started his career working in a steel company. Mr. Tepper's astute management at Goldman Sachs during the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash earned him laurels in the industry, as he bought debt that had dropped in value at the time but then recuperated the losses after the market recovered - resulting in gains for the investment bank.Today, we'll look at Mr. Tepper's top stock picks as the clouds of recession remain on the horizon and lawmakers wonder if a default will really be that bad. Some top picks of the billionaire are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

103,3de7993b-72fc-38fd-828f-5f7563f21b8b,GD,2023-05-19,General Dynamics (GD) Wins Deal to Support Abrams Battle Tanks (Revised),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-gd-wins-deal-124412354.html,1684413852,STORY,['GD'],"[General Dynamics Corp.’s GD business unit, Land Systems, recently clinched a modification contract involving Abrams battle tanks. The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Valued at $17.6 million, this contract is expected to be completed by May 24, 2024. The work related to this deal will be executed in Sterling Heights, MI.The contract involves foreign military sales to Kuwait and Poland.Significance of the Abrams TankThe M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams is the most advanced main battle tank. It boasts features that are technologically advanced in terms of communications, fire control and lethality, reliability, sustainment and fuel efficiency, along with an upgraded armor. The SEPv3 Abrams is also designed to seamlessly accept future upgrades.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in the land mission of the military. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. Moreover, the recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunition, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles for the U.S. Army. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.Its excellence and in-depth experience in building combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, has been leveraging the company to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such an upward trend in demand is likely to bolster GD’s revenue generation prospects from its Land System business unit and boost the company’s overall top line.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension have made it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any combat mission and land warfare affair.Per a report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.A few defense primes that can reap the multitude of gains from the expanding armored vehicle market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE System’s Challenger 2 is a heavily armored and highly mobile battle tank, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.BAESY’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.7%.

If the July decrease is approved, it would be the third reduction in the fuel portion of FPL bills in 2023.FPL offers energy-saving tips to customersEven with the latest proposed rate reduction, individual bills could increase as customers use more air conditioning during the summer months.

Shares have lost about 10.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.BNY Mellon Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates on Higher RevenuesBNY Mellon’s first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.13 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09. The bottom line reflects a rise of 20.2% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for earnings was 91 cents.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest revenues and marginally higher fee revenues. However, the assets under management (AUM) balance witnessed a decline. Higher expenses and provisions hurt the results to some extent.Net income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $905 million or $1.12 per share, up from $699 million or 86 cents per share recorded in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for net income was $645.9 million.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues increased 11.1% year over year to $4.36 billion. The top line marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.35 billion. Our estimate for revenues was $4.16 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, were $1.13 billion, up 60.9% year over year. The rise reflected higher interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expenses.The net interest margin (FTE basis) expanded 53 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.29%. Our estimate for NIM was 1.22%.Total fee and other revenues increased marginally to $3.24 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees, financing-related fees, distribution and servicing fees, and investment and other revenues. Our estimate for the same was $3.07 billion.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) were $3.10 billion, up 3.1% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components, except for net occupancy costs, sub-custodian and clearing costs, costs related to the amortization of intangible assets, and other expenses. Our estimate for expenses was $3.22 billion.Story continuesAsset Balances MixedAs of Mar 31, 2023, AUM was $1.9 trillion, down 15.8% year over year. The decline was due to lower market values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset by net inflows. Our estimate for AUM was $1.99 trillion.Assets under custody and/or administration of $46.6 trillion increased 2% year over year, primarily reflecting client inflows and net new business, partially offset by lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAllowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.27%, up 2 bps from the prior-year quarter. In the reported quarter, the company recorded a provision for credit losses of $27 million, up significantly from the $2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. We projected provisions of $20.5 million for the first quarter.As of Mar 31, 2023, non-performing assets were $105 million, down 11.8% year over year.Capital Position ImprovesAs of Mar 31, 2023, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11%, up from 10.1% as of the Mar 31, 2022 level. Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8%, up from 5.3% as of Mar 31, 2022.2023 OutlookManagement assumes current market-implied interest rates and deposit run-offs to be modest. Given such a scenario, NIR is expected to be up 20%, with further upside.Excluding notable items, expenses are expected to increase almost 4%, assuming exchange rates remain flat at where they were at 2022-end. On a constant currency basis, non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) are projected to rise nearly 4.5%.The effective tax rate is projected to be 21-22%, mainly due to the increase in the corporation tax rate in the U.K. this year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

It is also worth remembering that the benchmark still trades nearly 15% below its peaks, so total euphoria is far from back.The performance over the last year, which includes short-term peaks and valleys, highlights why investors with horizons of many years or even many decades are wise to stay invested and avoid too much market timing.Instead, most investors are best served buying strong, proven companies in good and bad times if they have faith in the health and stability of the U.S. economy and stock market over the long haul.If you believe in the global economic system and financial markets it is difficult to imagine that current index levels and stock prices won’t look “cheap” five, 10, or 20 years from now—almost no matter what happens in the near term. Plus, missing the market’s best days (which often occur within a few weeks of the worst days) is proven to negatively impact your returns in a very meaningful way.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe bears keep waiting for the earnings outlook to turn far worse than it already has over the last year. If the wider S&amp;P 500 earnings outlook holds steady through the summer, the bulls might be proven right in saying the worst is over (the current Q2 period) when it comes to corporate profits.Meanwhile, inflation is coming down and Wall Street is betting that Jay Powell and the Fed are essentially done raising rates. Many expect the Fed to start to lower rates by the end of 2023 or early 2024.Others might be focused on all the negativity and scary headlines around the debt ceiling. But a debt-ceiling deal will almost certainly get done because the alternative could cause unimaginable damage to the economy. Biden and McCarthy echoed this sentiment recently.Story continuesHere are two mega-cap stocks from different sectors of the economy that investors might want to buy in the back half of May and hold for years and years to come.Mastercard Incorporated (MA)Mastercard is a credit card powerhouse that operates an elaborate backend processing and payment network around the U.S. and globally. Mastercard essentially grabs a small percentage of the never-ending amount of credit card swipes, taps, and more that pass through its insanely complex global payment network. MA is poised to grow as the world becomes increasingly cashless. Mastercard is also actively diversifying to evolve and fight back against a wave of young and hungry fintech upstarts.Mastercard’s newer efforts include the likes of cryptocurrency, buy now pay later, and other potential growth segments. MA’s core credit card space remains insanely consistent and its travel-focused cross-border unit is booming again. MA currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but it topped our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates in late April, with its FY23 and FY24 earnings estimates up since then on the back of resilient consumer spending.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for Mastercard’s revenue to jump 13% in 2023 and over 12% higher next year to reach $28.27 billion, which would follow 18% sales growth in 2022 and 23% expansion in FY21. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge 15% this year and another 17% next year to extend a long history of impressive bottom line growth, fueled by Mastercard’s high-margin business.Mastercard stock has climbed nearly 40% off its October 2022 lows, including an 11% run in 2023. MA is still trading around where it was in the summer of 2021, having moved mostly sideways over the past two years. Yet, Mastercard might be ready to break out, with it back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Plus, it completed the golden cross, where the short-term moving average climbs back above the long-term trend, at the end of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMA shares touched fresh 52-week highs on Thursday. Yet, Mastercard is trading at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings to put it near its own decade-long median and at a 35% discount to its own 10-year highs. Mastercard is also trading about 9% below its average Zacks price target. And 20 of the 24 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Mastercard are “Strong Buys” next to three “Buys” and one “Hold.”Mastercard shares have skyrocketed over 1,110% in the past 15 years to edge out Microsoft and leave the S&amp;P 500’s 200% climb and the Zacks Tech Sector’s 250% run in the dust. Despite all of the established fintech firms and upstarts trying to edge out Mastercard, the credit card powerhouse remains a growth machine and deeply entrenched in the economic and financial system.McDonald’s (MCD)The McDonald’s brand consistently ranks in the top 10 globally alongside the likes of Apple, Disney, Nike, and others. McDonald’s hasn’t lost a step with older generations, while catering to younger people by rolling out digital point-of-sale kiosks, adding new on-trend menu items, and going all in on mobile ordering and delivery. In fact, the McDonald’s app was downloaded 127 million times worldwide in 2022, according to Apptopia to blow away Uber Eats’ 60 million, DoorDash’s 42 million, and Starbucks’ (SBUX) 34 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s posted 10.9% global comparable sales growth in 2022, which came on top of 17% YoY expansion in the key metric in 2021. MCD’s adjusted earnings climbed roughly 9% and 50%, respectively during this same stretch. The firm raised its 2023 guidance in late April on the back of higher prices and positive traffic growth, with its upbeat earnings revisions helping it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Zacks estimates call for MCD’s adjusted earnings to climb by 9% in 2023 and another 10% in FY24 on the back of 8% and 7%, respective revenue growth. Some of McDonald’s bottom-line expansion can be attributed to its corporate restructuring efforts and other initiatives aimed at streamlining operations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s is a Dividend Aristocrat that’s paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. MCD is up 28% in the last year and is trading well above its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The stock has more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, while destroying Disney, Coca-Cola, Walmart and other giants of various industries. MCD’s stock price sits near all-time highs, but it trades at a 15% discount to its own 10-year highs at 25.7X forward earnings.There are over 40,000 McDonald’s locations across over 100 countries, with roughly 95% owned by franchisees. McDonald’s customers know what they are getting when they eat at the fast-food titan, which is something Wall Street loves. And MCD shares have already cooled off substantially in recent weeks, falling back to neutral RSI levels vs. highly overbought in late April.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per the terms of the partnership, the role of the acquirer bank will be performed by FCMB, while Netplus will act as the payment service provider.Shares of Mastercard gained 1.8% on May 17.With the Mastercard Tap-on-Phone service, the Near Field Communication capabilities of merchants’ smart gadgets are activated and subsequently these can play the role of payment acceptance devices. This, in turn, enables the smart gadgets to establish connection with the contactless payment card of a customer, who merely needs to place the card on the merchant’s device for seamless payments. Thereafter, both the parties in a transaction benefit from higher processing speed and reduced waiting times.Apart from infusing ease and affordability, the newly launched payment solution also takes care of security threats that often comes hand in hand with digital transactions. Before transaction processing takes place, customers need to feed a unique four-digit PIN for authentication and authorization purposes.The contactless payment solution is likely to act as a blessing in disguise for Nigeria’s merchants since it not only saves time but also provides relief from exorbitant costs to establish a separate hardware POS device. Also, the cost-effective nature of the service makes its adoption easier for businesses of all sizes.While the trend to go digital is here to stay, the rollout of contactless payment solutions, such as Tap on Phone across several countries is likely to enable Mastercard occupy a significant share of the global digital payments market.  This time, the focus is on solidifying foothold in the digital payments market of Nigeria and its neighboring regions.FCMB and Netplus will complement MA’s endeavor since the companies share the mutual aim of developing cutting-edge, cost-effective and hassle-free payment solutions.Story continuesMA is focused on increasing digitization in several African nations as the continent continues to witness a flourishing digital economy. This is primarily attributable to increased Internet usage, a rapidly-growing young population and higher usage of smartphones.MA has also launched Tap-on-Phone services across the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Pakistan, to name a few.Shares of Mastercard have gained 16.5% in a year compared with the industry’s increase of 5.9%.

113,67674437-7be0-3b17-a219-4c72eceb1070,MA,2023-05-19,5 Financial Transaction Stocks to Watch as Digitization Gains Pace,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-watch-142202836.html,1684419722,STORY,"['WEX', '^GSPC', 'V', 'FLT', 'MA']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to gain on the back of the widespread uptake of digital means, leading to solid transaction volumes. A tactical merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy and tech investments enable the players to devise an advanced digital solutions suite. Resilient consumer spending, despite continued inflationary pressure, bodes well. Growing cross-border volumes resulting from a recovery in travel might boost the revenue growth of industry players. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. FLT and WEX Inc. WEX are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryGrowing Digitization: The pandemic led to a widespread inclination toward adopting digital means. Amid several roadblocks thrown by the pandemic, people became aware about the convenience and affordability brought about by digital payments. A diversified set of flexible payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later solutions, mobile wallets, biometrics, to QR code utilization, came to the forefront. The world witnessed a higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones. Thereby, financial transaction services stocks were compelled to launch contactless payment solutions or upgrade the existing ones in order to capture a sizable share of the global digital payments market. For such growth-related initiatives, the companies frequently resort to innovative technologies, which in turn, might escalate costs. However, digital prowess is pivotal in bolstering the customer base and diversifying income streams for the industry players in the long term.Story continuesA Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: Apart from tech investments, an active M&amp;A strategy is crucial to developing an efficient digital suite for financial transaction services companies. The pursuit of such a strategy also reflects their intensified focus on entering new markets, widening market share and attracting customers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by governments of different countries in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down. This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. An exciting year awaits, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Favorable Consumer Spending: Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market and substantial savings in hand keep the purchasing power of consumers steady amid looming fears of inflation and recession. The ease and affordability of e-commerce shopping continue to drive consumer spending growth and enable industry players to process a larger amount of transaction volumes through their card offerings. Per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending increased by $129.6 billion sequentially in the first quarter of 2023. Market and consumer data provider, Statista estimates consumer spending to witness 34.8% growth over the 2023-2028 period.Rebounding Cross-Border Travel: People are now likely to travel across the world, which can be either for recreational purposes or for business. With organizations preferring a return-to-office policy, business travel is likely to remain on an uptrend in the days ahead. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. In order to handle the growing pace of business travel, the industry players have come up with innovative business travel solutions for easier flight bookings.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

I'm Brian Sozzi. And it's almost time to pull out the old swim trunks and suntan lotion, hit the road for summer vacation. The summer travel season will come against a backdrop of a slowing US economy and nagging inflation. Concerns about the debt ceiling aren't helping, sentiment around travel either.Let's check in with Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern. Peter, always great to get some time with you here, where we're getting ready for the heart of the summer travel season. From your perspective, what are you seeing in terms of demand?PETER KERN: Well, I think it's already summer, so you should get your swim trunks out and get going. But we're seeing a ton of demand. Obviously, a big pickup you probably heard in international travel this summer as international trends have come back. So lots of demand domestically, lots of demand internationally. Still not all of the airlift back across the world. So still some tightness in supply in air. And, you know, unfortunately, that means prices are going to stay high for the summer.BRIAN SOZZI: Peter, how do trends in the business compare today or compare them to pre-pandemic levels?PETER KERN: Yeah. A lot of trends have actually returned to kind of pre-pandemic levels when you look at the splits between domestic and international, when you look at the splits between big city versus beaches and mountains, which were, you know, popular during COVID as getaway places. And we also saw a big stretch above duration of stay, length of stay during COVID, where people were basically fully hybrid or weren't going in the office, or you could go work for a month from wherever if you could afford to.And so those trends have all basically returned to pre-pandemic, which is length of stay has shrunk. Big cities are back in a big way. And-- and everything's kind of normalized international to domestic. There are still a few spots. China is not fully back, parts of Asia. But generally, things are returning to pretty much pre-pandemic normalcy.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Why are the prices climbing?PETER KERN: Why the price is high, is that what you say?BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.PETER KERN: Well, it's a surprise-- well, first of all, we had two years, several years of inflation. We had more demand than supply. There's still demand outstripping supply when you think of, you know, we think there's been a structural change and more people just want to travel generally. It's not revenge travel anymore. It's just more travel as opposed to spending money on other things. And you still, as I mentioned, got pockets where supply is not back fully.So prices were driven higher when there was tons of revenge travel, tons of inflation. And they got to a point. And now, they're basically holding, because demand has stayed up. And if you think about air travel. There's a little less supply in the world, so they can keep prices high. And in the hotel world, hotels have generally been willing to trade off a little volume for price, because getting employees is harder. There's other issues.So we've seen, you know, hotels, airlines, et cetera, sustain price. Car rental is a little different. Car supplies come back. And those prices have come down considerably. But certainly, in hotel and in air, they're staying pretty high.BRIAN SOZZI: How could this-- how long could this recovery and leisure travel continue? And I ask you that, Peter, because today, we get an earnings report from a Walmart, yesterday Target. And they're telling us that consumers are very cautious, so cautious that they're maybe not putting an extra pair of socks or another pair of bathing suits into their shopping basket, because inflation is so high.PETER KERN: Yeah. Look, I think so far again, we're not seeing any signs of it. I think it's clear that people are prioritizing travel over many other things. I don't know about stocks. But you know, I think we're going to-- it appears like it will sustain itself. And I think people, you know, again, have slightly more time, not as much time as during COVID. But with hybrid work, there's a little more time for leisure travel.There's a lot of, you know, factors going into it. But I think so far, and this is really across the globe, we're not seeing any real downturns from anything that we would all call, you know, economic pressure. So will it sustain itself forever? Who knows. But depending on the depth of any, you know, economic pressure we get, et cetera, it appears like travel will remain the top of the list of what people want to spend on. And-- and that means we should see travel and leisure travel hold up. Corporate travel slightly different. But certainly, in the leisure space, it's been incredibly strong.BRIAN SOZZI: Last time we talked, Peter, it sounded like you were getting ready to launch a new rewards program. And I know a lot of the analysts on the Street are excited to think about what that might mean to your bottom line. Where are you in that?PETER KERN: Yeah. So I'm even more excited than the analysts. So we are launching in July, in the US, it's basically what's called One Key. It will encompass our big three brands-- Expedia, hotels.com, and Vrbo. And you'll be able to earn cash, burn cash. We're calling it One Key cash across all of the products. So you can take a cruise and earn points and use it for vacation rental or vice versa, hotel, air, et cetera.So we're really excited about it. It's the first of its kind. We obviously have a huge member base. And we think putting the member bases together. And in vacation rentals, there hasn't even been a way to get rewarded. So now, this will be the first real rewards program for vacation rental, which we think is really powerful for Vrbo, and, even more importantly, the fact that you'll be able to share across all the brands. And we'll take that whole consumer base and be able to give them more benefits, more member discounts.We're sourcing more high-level discounts for people. There's going to be more package discounts. So there's a lot of benefits coming. And we're really excited. So we're launching that July 6 and have a big party in New York. You should come. And it's going to be great.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, you know my email, Peter. By all means, send the invite. And, you know, maybe when I do come to that party, we can talk about your AI initiatives. You, along with a lot of other companies, are teaming up with or looking into ChatGPT. What are you doing there? And how will AI change the travel experience?PETER KERN: Yeah. Well, first of all, we've got to work on your party game, because if you want to talk about AI at a party, we have an issue. But putting that aside, we're really excited about AI. We've been working in the space for a long time. And as I said on our earnings call and many other calls, you know, we've been working the space to enhance the consumer proposition for years. And that goes into every big and little thing you see, whether it's what images we show you, how we sort and filter for you, and a bunch of other things.But the onset of large language models and ChatGPT in particular was exciting to us. As I say, we stayed on the front foot on AI for a long time. And when that came, we really got after it to see how we could use it to enhance the consumer experience. So the first place we've experimented with is we have a plug-in into ChatGPT. And people can be in ChatGPT, ask travel questions, get recommendations from ChatGPT, and then click off into our environment.Now, that's only for the developer universe and the page universe. So it's not available to everybody yet. But we were basically the first in travel to get there. And then the inverse is, maybe more exciting, we brought ChatGPT into our app, our iOS app. And we're basically allowing people to use ChatGPT to ask, where should I stay near the Empire State Building or near the Eiffel Tower? What are the best hotels there? Whatever, they can ask a bunch of questions.And then as they get recommendations, we save those recommendations to our trip planning products. And you can go in and search and compare and do all those things. But there's lots more potential for that. And we are looking at interesting ways to use ChatGPT to help in service. Perhaps, help people in search and sort if they want to ask longer, bigger questions.So there's really a lot of areas where it has application. And we're working closely with ChatGPT and looking at ways where we can utilize the technology.BRIAN SOZZI: As a leader working so closely with AI, Peter, I know there's some very interesting initiatives. Bigger picture, do you have any concerns how AI impacts the economy over time?PETER KERN: Yeah. You know, we've watched a lot, I've watched a lot of the debates. I think they're really interesting. And obviously, there are implications for humanity. And I know people like to get focused on the political environment and other places where it can be used or perhaps abused. I think, you know, many have said, including Sam Altman, that, you know, probably regulation will be required. And I think that's a healthy thing.But I think when people think about it, they get over bias towards all of those dramatic stories. There are a lot of really, really good applications that don't take jobs away, don't change the political climate. They really just enhance people's experiences with products that we use every day or try to use every day. And I think, if you think about all the ways that can enhance people's experience, you know, if searching is complicated, there's all kinds of applications that people with that have disabilities or other challenges.So there's a lot of great uses and utility to really enhance what people are doing as opposed to replace what people are doing. So I think in our environment as a perfect example, you know, we had to build guardrails for ChatGPT, so that it would only answer travel questions. We didn't want it to get into other things with our consumers. We're not interested in answering those problems.So you have to-- you know, you can't just set it free and see what happens. You have to use it for a particular application. But if used in the right ways, we think it's incredibly valuable to enhancing a consumer experience, our workers experience. Our service personnel can we'll be able to use it someday. And we're constantly working to enhance those things. So if this helps us do better, that'll be great.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, when I see you at that party in New York City, Peter, we have bathing suits in artificial intelligence to talk about. Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon.PETER KERN: Thanks, Brian. Look forward to your bathing suit recommendations. Thanks.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm just going to show up wearing it. Peter Kern, thanks so much.]"

""No one does this better than the U.S. Air Force, but we will lose that edge if we don't move forward now.""The Air Force plans to spend $2.3 billion on the program in fiscal 2024, and an additional $595 million to continue engine development for the new fighter.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna Editing by Leslie Adler and Richard Chang)]"

Shares have lost about 7.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Lockheed due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Lockheed's Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Sales Rise Y/YLockheed Martin reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $6.43 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.07 by 5.9%. The bottom line, however, was in line with the year-ago quarter's figure.The company reported GAAP earnings of $6.61 per share in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $6.44 in the prior-year quarter.Our model projected adjusted earnings of $6.15 per share for the same time frame.Operational HighlightsNet sales amounted to $15.13 billion in the reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.87 billion by 1.9%. The top line rose 1.1% from $14.96 billion in the year-ago quarter.Our model projected net sales of $14.84 billion for the first quarter of 2023.BacklogLockheed Martin's backlog as of Mar 26, 2023, was $145.09 billion compared with $150 billion at the end of 2022. The Aeronautics segment accounted for $53.30 billion of this amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $34.91 billion.The Space Systems, and the Missiles and Fire Control segments contributed $29.44 billion and $27.45 billion, respectively.Segmental PerformanceAeronautics: Sales declined 2% year over year to $6.27 billion primarily due to lower volume on production contracts for the F-35 program.The segment’s operating profit decreased 1% year over year to $675 million. The operating margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 10.8%.Missiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales dropped 3% year over year to $2.39 billion. This was due to lower sales from the sensors and global sustainment programs, as well as marginal sales of $60 million from the tactical and strike missile programs.Story continuesThe segment’s operating profit decreased 2% year over year to $377 million, while the operating margin expanded 10 bps to 15.8%.Space Systems: Sales increased 16% year over year to $2.96 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, national security space programs, and commercial civil space programs.The segment’s operating profit improved 13% to $280 million. The operating margin contracted 20 bps to 9.5% in the quarter under review.Rotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues dropped 1% to $3.51 billion on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales from Sikorsky helicopter program, as well as various C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) programs.The segment’s operating profit declined 14% to $350 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin contracted 140 bps to 10% in the same time frame.Financial ConditionLockheed Martin’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.44 billion at the end of first-quarter 2023 compared with $2.55 billion at the end of 2022. Cash from operating activities amounted to $1.56 billion compared with $1.41 billion in the year-ago period.GuidanceLockheed Martin reiterated its financial guidance for 2023. The company expects revenues of $65-66 billion for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $65.71 billion, which is slightly lower than the mid-point of the company’s guided range.LMT’s earnings per share are anticipated to be $26.60-$26.90 for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s full-year earnings of $26.86 per share is higher than the mid-point of the company’s guidance range.Lockheed Martin expects a free cash flow of $6.2 billion for 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, Lockheed has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Lockheed has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Details of the DealValued at $65.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Sep 30, 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Huntington Ingalls will provide engineering and technical support for CVN 80 and CVN 81 aircraft carriers.Work related to this deal will be executed in Newport News, VA.Aircraft Carriers &amp; Huntington IngallsHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News unit is an expert in engineering, design and construction of U.S. Navy CVNs. These are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet, with a displacement of more than 90,000 tons.The abovementioned unit has designed and built the first next generation ship, Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers, and more than 31 aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy since 1933. This includes all 10 Nimitz class (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in service.The U.S. defense budget request for fiscal 2024 reflects continued investment in shipbuilding, funding the second Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine, two Virginia class (SSN 774) attack submarines, two Flight III Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers and the final increment of Fallujah (LHA 9).The budget request also reflects funding for USS Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) nuclear aircraft carriers and aircraft carrier refueling programs, and investment in the submarine industrial base. This should benefit Huntington Ingalls’ shipbuilding business significantly.The aforementioned discussion reflects the solid position that HII enjoys in the nuclear aircraft carrier market, resulting in a strong inflow of contracts for the company. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsNations are strengthening their defense capabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions. In this context, the demand for military ships with next-generation technology-based warfare capabilities, is gaining momentum. This is due to the system’s growing importance in military missions.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the aircraft carrier ship market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 2% during the 2023-2028 period. Such solid growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for Huntington Ingalls, as it enjoys the lucrative position of a prominent aircraft carrier in the market.A few other defense primes that can gain from the expanding aircraft carrier market are General Dynamics GD, BAE Systems BAESY and Lockheed Martin LMT.Story continuesGeneral Dynamics’ NASSCO-Norfolk, a consolidation of two great shipyards, is a Master Ship Repair contractor. It provides high-quality and cost-effective maintenance and modernization for the U.S. Navy.With facilities in Bremerton, WA, in the Pacific Northwest, NASSCO-Norfolk holds experience in more than 450 ships, a Master Ship Repair Agreement contract, and the maintenance and repair of aircraft carriers from the Navy's amphibious fleet.GD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 5% from the year-ago reported figure.BAE Systems designs and manufactures naval ships as well as state-of-the-art combat systems and equipment supporting those warships. The company played a key role in the design and construction of the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier, the largest warship in the United Kingdom. It also provides management and delivery of planned overseas support to the aircraft carrier.BAESY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 25.4% from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block 2 systems are used to upgrade warships’ electronic warfare capabilities. This helps warfighters respond to evolving threats.The company also offers upgrade to the AN/SLQ-32 systems on U.S. aircraft carriers to determine if its potential foes are tracking the ships using electronic sensors.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

(MHO) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-homes-inc-mho-hits-131501745.html,1684415701,STORY,"['MHO', 'PHM']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of M/I Homes (MHO)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $71.22 in the previous session. M/I Homes has gained 54.2% since the start of the year compared to the 15.3% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 33.1% return for the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2023, M/I Homes reported EPS of $3.64 versus consensus estimate of $2.36.For the current fiscal year, M/I Homes is expected to post earnings of $12.40 per share on $3.71 billion in revenues. This represents a -30.1% change in EPS on a -10.15% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $13.17 per share on $3.91 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.21% and 5.22%, respectively.Valuation MetricsM/I Homes may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.M/I Homes has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 5.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 9.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 3.7X versus its peer group's average of 5.4X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, M/I Homes currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if M/I Homes fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though M/I Homes shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does MHO Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MHO have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM). PHM has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. PulteGroup, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 32.02%, and for the current fiscal year, PHM is expected to post earnings of $9.05 per share on revenue of $15.03 billion.Shares of PulteGroup, Inc. have gained 11.3% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 7.68X and a P/CF of 5.94X.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the top 2% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MHO and PHM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

122,8b6ba3d0-27d0-3d0b-9c01-fe6bf16f93ff,PHM,2023-05-19,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in PulteGroup Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-pultegroup-123012039.html,1684326612,STORY,['PHM'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in PulteGroup (PHM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PHM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?PulteGroup's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at PulteGroup's main business drivers.Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup Inc. engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding (which accounted for 98.1% as of 2022 total revenues) and Financial Services (1.9%).The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices, with a variety of options and amenities to all major customer segments: first-time, move-up and active adult. Pulte’s brand portfolio includes Centex, Pulte Homes,Del Webb, DiVosta Homes, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.The company operates in 810 active communities in 42 markets in 24 states across the United States in 2022. The homebuilding division is broken down into six reportable segments; Northeast, Southeast, Florida, Texas, Midwest and West.Pulte’s direct subsidiaries under the homebuilding segment include Pulte Diversified Companies Inc., Del Webb Corporation and Centex Corporation.Pulte’s Financial Services business includes mortgage banking and title operations through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Pulte Mortgage arranges financing by originating mortgage loans for homebuyers.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s orders were 8,898 units, up from 8,767 homes in the prior- year quarter. Quarter-end backlog totaled 13,129 homes versus 19,935 units in the year ago quarter. Potential housing revenues from quarter-end backlog decreased 30.8% from the prior-year to $8 billion.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in PulteGroup ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $2,970.45, or a 197.04% gain, as of May 17, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 149.01% and the price of gold increased 41.05% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for PHM.Shares of PulteGroup have outperformed its industry in the past three months. The company reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32% and 9.4%, respectively. The company has been benefiting from robust land acquisition and operational strategic initiatives. PHM expects the land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. This is attributed to strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 30 days. Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues, and significant inflation are dampening the performance, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 10.82%, and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft MSFT, Activision Blizzard ATVI and Sony's SONY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Just when investors thought the housing market would implode under the ""squared weight"" of (1) a steeply inverted yield curve and (2) the regional banking crisis, we are witness to homebuilders like PulteGroup putting up solid Q1 numbers and guidance that lift their prospects considerably.The reason that PHM is a Zacks #1 Rank now is that analysts launched their consensus estimates since that report from full-year EPS of $7.44 to $9.05.And next year's profit haul also moved higher from $7.24 to $9.00 per share.This rebound may mark the earnings trough not only for many homebuilders, but for real estate in general.Inflation and Interest Rates: Have They Peaked?This past weekend I published an article about the ""possible peak"" in my real estate-focused newsletter Multifamily Investing.You can read the full version at the link but here is a synopsis...The US economy is doing a pretty good job of absorbing the regional banking crisis.Despite the persistence of digital banks runs -- with short-sellers preying on blood in the water to drive out deposits by pummeling stock prices -- the stock market has held up well and the Federal Reserve signaled a pause in their efforts to battle inflation.Meanwhile, job creation, consumer spending, and housing markets remain strong according to a collection of robust data sets.This scenario sets up ""the pause"" for the Fed with interest rate hikes.That diverse body of economists, with tons of data and analysis at their disposal, has done a good amount to tamp down wildfire inflation.And while the yield curve will remain inverted for some time, the message is clear that they have taken a big bite out of the cost surges.Story continuesSo now we are seeing inflation stabilize across many sectors. Sure, 5-7% inflation in some sectors like Food &amp; Energy are alarming.But what matters now to investors is the trend direction and speed.And that trend is showing a new downward trajectory in inflation and a slowing in the rate of acceleration in either direction.History shows that this pattern leads to the fire being put out.Especially in the age of exponential technologies that tend to foster hyper productivity and disinflation. Honestly, when was the last time you had to worry about sending a check, a document, a photo, or yourself for a signature when they can all be done now instantaneously?What's the Impact for Real Estate?While I thought the regional banking crisis would have a bigger negative impact on mortgage lending than the positives of the Fed pause, I'm starting to reconsider that idea.In their article for Forbes Advisor, Mortgage Rate Forecast For 2023, Robin Rothstein and Chris Jennings (Editor) suggest that the inflation battle is being won and the market is recognizing this...Recent data indicates the Fed's tightening policy seems to be working, though some analysts say too well, given the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector. Nevertheless, headline inflation cooled to 5% in March for the first time in nearly two years and is well below its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. Even so, the current rate is still far above the Fed's 2% goal.The good thing about this article is that they quote a variety of real estate-focused economists and analysts sharing their views of the unfolding interest rate landscape.On the alarmed end of the spectrum comes this...""The latest interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unnecessary and harmful,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, in an emailed statement. ""(Small regional banks) are becoming zombie-like banks, unable to lend even to good businesses as they are more concerned with balance sheet shuffling for survival. This situation will worsen with each additional rate hike by the Federal Reserve.""Among the optimists were these forecasts...National Association of Realtors (NAR). ""[F]orecasts that ... mortgage rates will drop—with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate progressively falling to 6.0% this year and to 5.6% in 2024.""Compass U.S. region president, Neda Navab. ""There have been signals that mortgage interest rates may be at or near their peak, given recent encouraging news around inflation and a corresponding drop in the U.S. Treasury yields that help set mortgage rates. A sustained drop could push mortgage rates into the 5% range late in the second quarter or in the second half of 2023, but that's definitely not guaranteed.""Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). ""Long-term rates have already peaked. We expect that 30-year mortgage rates will end 2023 at 5.2%.""What About the Debt Ceiling Battle?We've seen this movie before and it usually gets resolved after some customary political brinkmanship.But the Forbes Advisor piece does share some additional views, including the idea that the uncertainty and potential for default will keep rates elevated into the summer.This remains the wild card for the spring home-buying season.The good news is that digital-centric financial markets are extremely quick at absorbing new information (good or bad) and discounting new trends.This means that barring a tumultuous US default event, inflation and rates are trending down, the regional bank crisis volatility is being absorbed by much bigger banks, and national lenders, builders, and investors will be modeling for rates in the 5% handle.And if the economy avoids recession, then all the bargains I was expecting in the Multifamily space may not unfold either. To learn more, check out this on-demand educational webinar from Mike Morawski where he goes over the return dynamics, underwriting traps, and tax advantages of Multifamily Investing...Creating Generational WealthMike has some great slides in there that illustrate what I call the ""power laws"" of Cash Flow and Equity Build.Bottom line: We could still get more Regional Bank scares, but the intelligence of the market discounting machine has weighed and measured what these failures mean and found them lacking in systemic or economic impact. I am surprised by this, but then again, this is a feature and not a bug of US economic resilience as I talked about in my recent vlog...Dollar Destruction Hysteria: Why the Panic is Wrong, AgainBear of the Day:Vornado Realty Trust made headlines earlier this year when they defaulted on a $450 million commercial property loan in NYC.Vornado first-quarter 2023 funds from operations (FFO) plus assumed conversions as adjusted per share of 60 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Moreover, the figure declined 24.1% year over year.Quarterly results display better-than-anticipated revenues aided by healthy leasing activity. However, higher operating expenses acted as a dampener.Total revenues came in at $445.9 million in the reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $443.7 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues improved nearly 1%.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, total same-store net operating income (NOI) (at share) came in at $264.6 million compared with the prior-year quarter's $264.7 million. The metric for the New York and 555 California Street portfolios improved 1.6% and 4.3%, respectively. However, the same-store NOI (at share) for THE MART portfolio declined 22.6% from the prior-year period.Operating expenses flared up 5.7% to $228.8 million year over year.During the quarter, in the New York office portfolio, 777,000 square feet of office space (771,000 square feet at share) was leased for an initial rent of $101.02 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 9.5 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $2.48 per square foot per annum or 2.5% of the initial rent.In the New York retail portfolio, 25,000 square feet were leased (20,000 square feet at share) at an initial rent of $373.07 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 6.8 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $26.54 per square foot per annum or 7.1% of the initial rent.Additionally, at THE MART, 79,000 square feet of space (all at share) was leased for an initial rent of $56.44 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 6.8 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $8.04 per square foot per annum or 14.2% of the initial rent.For VNO's 555 California Street portfolio, 4,000 square feet of space (3,000 square feet at share) was leased for an initial rent of $156.96 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of seven years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $39.07 per square foot per annum, or 24.9% of the initial rent.Vornado ended the quarter with occupancy in the New York portfolio at 89.9%, down 130 basis points (bps) year over year. Occupancy in THE MART declined to 80.3% from 88.9%. However, occupancy in 555 California Street improved 70 bps to 94.9%.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Vornado and Rudin closed the earlier announced transactions related to their 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street properties with Citadel Enterprise Americas LLC (""Citadel"") and with an affiliate of Kenneth C. Griffin, Citadel's Founder and CEO (""KG"").Additionally, Vornado entered into a joint venture (JV) with Rudin (""Vornado/Rudin"") to purchase 39 East 51st Street for $40 million. Upon the formation of the KG JV, VNO intends to combine this property with 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street to create a premier development site, to be known as ""Site"" collectively. The transaction is expected to be completed in second-quarter 2023.Balance SheetVornado exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $890.9 million, slightly up from $889.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Additional content:Microsoft's (MSFT) $69B Activision Deal Gets EU ClearanceMicrosoft has received approval from The European Union for its $69-billion acquisition of Call of Duty-maker Activision Blizzard. This decision goes against the U.K. and U.S. authorities, who have concerns about the deal.The European Commission, after conducting its analysis, concluded that the acquisition would not harm competition. Microsoft made a promise to allow other companies in the cloud gaming market to offer popular games like Call of Duty on their platforms for the next ten years. However, the deal still faces legal challenges in the United States and the U.K., which could be difficult for Microsoft to overcome.The EU's decision is seen as positive for competition and is expected to give a boost to the cloud streaming market, which currently makes up a small percentage of the overall gaming industry.The EU's viewpoint contrasts with that of the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission, both of which had reservations about the deal. The main difference in opinions seems to revolve around how quickly the cloud gaming market will grow in the future.Overall, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has received EU approval but the deal's ultimate success depends on overcoming legal hurdles in the United States and the U.K. The decision by the EU shows confidence in the potential benefits of competition and growth of the cloud gaming market.What's the Problem with the Acquisition?The main problem with the acquisition is regarding the competition. Microsoft's gaming division would have too much of the industry, which could unfairly limit its competitors and ultimately harm consumers.In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wants to stop Microsoft from buying Activision, as they believe it could have negative effects. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also concerned that the deal could lead to higher prices and fewer options for gamers in the U.K.The CMA has issues with the solutions Microsoft proposed to address these concerns. The problem revolves around exclusivity – if Microsoft wants to benefit the most from the deal, they might make future games from Activision exclusive to Xbox and PC, leaving out Sony's PlayStation.Since Microsoft acquired Minecraft in 2014, the game has been available on platforms owned by Sony and others without any restrictions. As part of the ongoing discussions surrounding the Activision deal, Microsoft has made a commitment to keep Call of Duty, which has been a major point of contention, accessible on Sony and Nintendo platforms for ten years following the completion of the acquisition.Although the deal is approved by the EU, it may not go through. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had a dissenting opinion last month. CMA had cited cloud gaming market as a concern, which is now agreed by Microsoft. This could make the difference in CMA's decision.Microsoft's Gaming Prospects to Get a BoostThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is building an Xbox mobile store, which will offer games directly to mobile devices. Microsoft wants to add Activision Blizzard content to this store to build on its already existing communities of gamers.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks.For fiscal fourth-quarter Microsoft expects Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens due to third-party and first-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass.Microsoft's shares have gained 30.6% year to date, whereas the Zacks Computer and Technology sector have grown 22.7%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

124,5317f4b7-0439-3526-8dab-8336b31f2111,BAX,2023-05-19,Baxter International's (NYSE:BAX) Dividend Will Be $0.29,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-internationals-nyse-bax-dividend-102320634.html,1684491800,STORY,['BAX'],"[Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) will pay a dividend of $0.29 on the 3rd of July. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.7%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Baxter International Baxter International Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Even while not generating a profit, Baxter International is paying out most of its free cash flows as a dividend. Generally paying a dividend without making profits isn't a great idea and we are also worried that there is limited reinvestment into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 123.1%. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 117%, which is a bit high and could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.16. The dividend has shrunk at around 4.3% a year during that period. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Over the past five years, it looks as though Baxter International's EPS has declined at around 38% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Baxter International's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Baxter International you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Shares have lost about 2.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Johnson &amp; Johnson due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q1 Earnings &amp; Sales Top, 2023 View UpJ&amp;J’s first-quarter 2023 earnings came in at $2.68 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 as well as our estimate of $2.49 per share. Earnings rose 0.4% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings exclude intangible amortization and some other special items, primarily a $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal. Including these items, J&amp;J reported first-quarter loss of 3 cents per share, down 101.6% from the year-ago quarter.Sales came in at $24.75 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion. Sales rose 5.6% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 9% and a negative currency impact of 3.4%. Sales also beat our estimates of $23.6 billion.Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 7.6% on an operational basis compared with an 0.8% increase in the previous quarter.First-quarter sales in the domestic market rose 9.7% to $12.52 billion. International sales rose 1.8% on a reported basis to $12.23 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 8.3%, plus a negative currency impact of 6.5%. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an adjusted operational basis, international sales rose 7.9% in the quarter.All three segments delivered a strong performance in the quarter, with sales in all segments rising sequentially over the fourth quarter.Segment DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 4.2% year over year to $13.41 billion, reflecting a 7.2% operational increase and a 3% negative currency impact. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 7.2%. Pharmaceutical segment sales exceeded our estimates of $12.62 billion.Sales in the domestic market rose 5.9% to $7.02 billion. International sales rose 2.4% to $6.39 billion (operational increase 8.6%).Higher sales of key products, such as Darzalex, Stelara, Tremfya and Erleada and J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine drove the segment’s growth. The sales growth was dampened by lower sales of Imbruvica and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.Darzalex sales rose 22% year over year to $2.26 billion in the quarter, which beat our estimates of $2.14 billion.Stelara sales grew 6.8% to $2.44 billion in the quarter driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and price. Stelara sales beat our estimate of $2.42 billion.  Imbruvica sales declined 20.3% to $827 million. Rising competitive pressure in the United States due to new oral competition has been hurting sales of Imbruvica for the past few quarters. Imbruvica sales missed our estimates of $870.6 million.Erleada generated sales of $542 million in the quarter, up 35.6% year over year. Tremfya recorded sales of $640 million in the quarter, up 8.4% year over year, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix.New drug, Carvykti, a BCMA CAR-T therapy approved for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, recorded sales of $72 million. New drug, Spravato, approved for treatment-resistant depression, recorded sales of $131 million, up 86.9% year over year.PAH revenues of $872 million rose 2.4% year over year. Xarelto sales rose 13.7% in the quarter to $578 million.Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza/Trevicta sales declined 0.4% to $1.04 billion in the quarter. Simponi/Simponi Aria sales declined 5.8% to $537 million, while Prezista sales decreased 4.8% to $477 million.  Zytiga sales declined 54.5% to $245 million in the quarter due to generic competition. Sales of Remicade were down 26.5% in the quarter to $487 million.J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine generated sales of $747 million in the quarter, up 63.4% year over year. International sales accounted for all COVID-19 vaccine sales.Excluding COVID-19 vaccine, sales in the Pharmaceutical segment rose 2% as an operational increase of 4.9% was offset by a negative currency movement of 2.9%.J&amp;J continues to expect its Pharmaceutical business to deliver market-leading adjusted operational sales growth in 2023 despite the Stelara loss of exclusivity in late 2023 in the United States. However, loss of exclusivity of products like Remicade, Zytiga and Xeplion and increased austerity measures across Europe are expected to put pressure on the top line. J&amp;J does not expect any material sales from the COVID-19 vaccine in 2023 beyond what it recorded in the first quarter as its contractual commitments are now over.Overall, J&amp;J expects a relatively consistent performance throughout the year from the Pharma segment as regards quarterly phasing.MedTech segment sales came in at $7.48 billion, up 7.3% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 11% was offset by a negative currency movement of 3.7%. MedTech segment sales beat our estimate of $7.32 billionExcluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 6.4%. Abiomed, acquired last year, contributed 4.6% of operational sales growth.Sales in the MedTech segment were driven by a recovery in surgical procedures, better commercial execution and new product launches, which led to better sequential growth in all four MedTech businesses. However, sales were partly hurt by volume-based procurement (VBP) issues in China and as well as supply constraints. However, procedure volumes improved in China.Interventional Solutions grew 41.8% on an operational basis. Excluding the acquisition of Abiomed, the Interventional Solutions business rose 12.3% driven by double-digit sales growth of electrophysiology products in all regions except Asia-Pacific. In Surgery, Advanced Surgery rose 1.6% worldwide. General Surgery rose 6.4% worldwide. Worldwide orthopedics rose 5.1%, driven by strong procedure recovery and successfully launched new products. Worldwide Vision rose 7.6%.Domestic market sales rose 16.6% year over year to $3.76 billion. International market sales declined 0.6% year over year to $3.72 billion, which included an operational increase of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 6.8%.In the MedTech segment, J&amp;J expects continued recovery in worldwide procedure volumes and uptake from recently launched products to drive sales in 2023. J&amp;J expects relatively stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels through the rest of 2023, with normal seasonality. J&amp;J expects a relatively consistent performance throughout the year from the MedTech segment with regard to quarterly phasing.The Consumer Health segment recorded revenues of $3.85 billion in the reported quarter, up 7.4% year over year, reflecting an 11.3% operational increase and a 3.9% negative currency impact. Consumer Health segment sales came ahead of our estimate of $3.640 million.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 11.3% worldwide.The sales growth was driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to an exceptionally strong cold, cough and flu season in Europe and a one-time retailer restocking primarily in the United States.Sales in the domestic market rose 11.4% from the year-ago period to $1.74 billion. The international segment rose 4.4% to $2.12 billion, which included an operational increase of 11.3% and a negative currency impact of 6.9%.Story continuesRaises 2023 GuidanceThe company raised its previously issued financial guidance for 2023.J&amp;J raised its revenue guidance to a range of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion from $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance excludes any revenues from J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine. Revenue growth is now expected in the range of 5.5%-6.5% versus the prior expectation of 4.5%-5.5%.Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, operational constant-currency sales are expected to increase in the range of 5.5%-6.5% versus the prior expectation of 4.5%-5.5%. Adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth is now expected to be 4.5%-5.5% (prior expectation of 3.5%-4.5%).The adjusted earnings per share guidance was raised from a range of $10.45-$10.65 to $10.60-$10.70.The earnings range indicates an increase of 4.5%-5.5% versus the prior expectation of 3. On an operational, constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 3.5%-4.5% versus the prior expectation of 2.5%-4.5%.J&amp;J expects minimal impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for 2023 as the dollar has strengthened against most currencies.Adjusted pretax operating margins are expected to be flat from 2022 levels as the impact of continued operating expense leverage will be offset by the impact of inflationary pressure. J&amp;J expects supply constraints, inflationary pressure and rising input costs to continue to hurt margins in 2023. Operating margin is expected to be better in the second half than the first.Other income is expected to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Adjusted tax rate guidance was maintained in the range of 15.5 % to 16.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The attendee was surprised and inspired to see a South Asian in the spotlight at such a prestigious event.That's when he realized he could make a bigger difference for other people of Asian descent at Medtronic. Shortly after, the vice president of research and development joined the Asian Impact at Medtronic Network (AIM) and is now co-chair of the global Network that has 20 local hubs and 4,800+ members across the Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA.During his time in that role, he's focused on developing talent through mentorship. He also sees the need to continually create value for patients through increased representation across Medtronic - not just in our engineering departments.""It's about ensuring diversity in all our teams,"" Prakash said, adding that increased representation in customer- and patient-facing roles is key.Important conversations about health disparities are more likely to happen if our teams are diverse, he said.This commitment to inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&amp;E) accelerates innovation and helps bring our lifesaving technologies to more patients around the world. And Prakash is just one Medtronic employee actively making AAPI history and fostering belonging for Asian-descent colleagues.Medtronic was also recently honored for its ongoing commitment to ID&amp;E and the Asian-descent community. Recognized consistently by Asia Society since 2014, this year Medtronic won two awards from Asia Society's biennial 2023 Asian Corporate Survey.This recognition is especially meaningful because it's heavily based on anonymous feedback from our AAPI employees, authentically reflecting our ID&amp;E culture and progress that employees themselves are feeling.Story continuesBest Employer for Supporting AAPI Employee's Belonging and InclusionBest Employer for AAPI Employee Growth and AdvancementAs we continue to break down barriers, there are a couple of key things to consider during AAPI Heritage Month and beyond, Prakash said.The AAPI community is not a monolithOften, people act as if being Asian American is one culture, Prakash said. But both in the AAPI community and in India, there are hundreds of cultures.""To many people I'm just an Indian who speaks Indian, but there's a decent amount of diversity in India,"" he said.It's important to understand and get to know the culture of the people you work with.""That creates better teams,"" he said.While not a monolith, the barriers and challenges people of Asian descent face are often shared experiences - and an opportunity to learn and build solidarity.Avoid stereotyping""Oh, you are an Asian so you must be good at math. Maybe you should be an engineer,"" is a common refrain, Prakash said.He sees that thinking as an obstacle to increasing representation across fields, and it can keep employers from giving people a chance.""We have to broaden our thinking,"" he said.The AIM Network is encouraging people to AIM Higher, both within and across communities this AAPI Heritage Month.

Yet, unfavorable currency movements have been a dampener over the last few quarters. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Medtronic is expanding the global foothold of its Cardiovascular business (consisting of more than 36% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2022). Within Cardiovascular, cardiac rhythm management, one of Medtronic’s largest businesses, continued to build on the company’s category leadership. Medtronic’s pacing business continued to outperform the market banking on strong global growth of the Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands in existing markets.Micra grew 14% in the fiscal third quarter. Further, ICDs (Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) within cardiac rhythm management grew 7% year over year as replacement headwinds moderated. The company is expected to gain significant market share with the latest CE Mark for its Aurora Extravascular ICD. The company currently expects the U.S. approval of the same in the next calendar year.Within Structural Heart, the company looks forward to market share gain on strong Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) prospects. According to Medtronic, TAVR is one of the largest growth drivers for the company and it expects the market, which is roughly $5.5 billion today, to exceed $7 billion within the next three years and reach $10 billion in the next five years. In the fiscal third quarter, despite healthcare staffing challenges and COVID in Japan, this business recorded 11% year-over-year growth, including 12% growth in the United States, led by the full-market release of its next-generation TAVR Evolut FX valve in October.Medtronic PLC PriceMedtronic PLC PriceMedtronic PLC price | Medtronic PLC QuoteOn the flip side, Medtronic noted that while the impact of the COVID resurgence has diminished, in several of its markets, supply constraints recovery is slow. With regard to procedural volumes, in addition to incremental China VBP, the company is still seeing lower volumes in elective coronary PCI, GI procedures, TAVR, spinal cord stim and some less emergent surgical procedures. The slower-than-anticipated recovery in procedural volumes primarily occurred in developed markets as healthcare systems continued to work through staffing and other challenges.Like its peers, Medtronic is currently affected by the industry-wide inflationary concern with increased freight expense. The company in this regard noted that the full impact of inflation on its raw material and direct labor costs would be realized over the next couple of quarters with the inventory rolling off the company’s balance sheet. This will affect the gross margin.Story continuesWith Medtronic recording a significant portion of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. On the fiscal third-quarter earnings call, Medtronic noted that fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings would be negatively impacted by approximately 21 cents from adverse currency translation.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Davita Inc DVA.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Addus Homecare’s 2023 earnings indicates 10.9% year-over-year growth.

129,ad26e222-1c9d-3966-8d91-76a83d2a6362,MDT,2023-05-19,Medtronic (MDT) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-mdt-reports-next-week-140002334.html,1684418402,STORY,['MDT'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Medtronic (MDT) reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.6%.Revenues are expected to be $8.25 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Medtronic?For Medtronic, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Medtronic will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Medtronic would post earnings of $1.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +3.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Medtronic doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:RSG) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-services-inc-nyse-rsg-114254384.html,1684410174.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Republic Services How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Republic Services is:15% = US$1.5b ÷ US$9.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.Does Republic Services Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Republic Services has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Republic Services visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesRepublic Services' Debt And Its 15% ROERepublic Services does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.21. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Republic Services may not be the best stock to buy.

But this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is still bullish on fertilizer demand in 2023.The Mosaic Company, headquartered in Tampa, FL, is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. It supplies phosphates and potash fertilizers and feed ingredients for the global agriculture industry.Another Earnings Miss in Q1On May 3, Mosaic reported its first quarter 2023 earnings and it reported earnings of $1.14 which was a miss of 10.9%, or $0.14. The Zacks Consensus was looking for $1.28.It was the fifth earnings miss in a row.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRevenue fell 8% to $3.6 billion reflecting the impact of lower prices which were somewhat offset by higher volumes.In its three big categories, volumes were higher in 2023 than in 2022. In Potash, sales volume million tonnes was 1.9 compared to 1.8 last year. In Phosphate, sales volume million tonnes was 1.8 compared to 1.7 last year and in Mosaic Fertilizantes sales volume million tonnes was 2.1 compared to 1.8.But it was the opposite in sales price.Potash MOP Selling Price fell to $421 from $582 last year. Phosphate DAP Selling Price fell to $660 from $785. Mosaic Fertilizantes finished product selling price was $646, down from $817.Gross margins fell to 18.6% from 36.7% last year.Earnings Estimates SlashedThe analysts have been aggressively cutting their earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 the last 3 months as fertilizer prices have softened.For 2023, 4 have cut the last 30 days and 1 in just the last week. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has plunged to $5.05 from $8.45 in just the last 3 months.That's an earnings decline of 54% from 2022, when it made $11.01.The cuts extend into 2024 as well. 5 estimates were cut in the last month for 2024 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.02 from $5.48 just 3 months before.That's another 20.4% drop.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMosaic Optimistic About DemandTo counter all that analyst bearishness, which is the reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is the company's industry outlook.It expects the grain and oilseed markets to remain tight through 2023 and beyond. Mosaic said in North America, sentiment has improved ""significantly"" compared to the second half of 2022.Mosaic also said spring nutrient application rates were trending toward normal levels. And for both potash and phosphates, supply constraints remain.Shares Down BigBut until earnings turn around and get raised, instead of cut, investors have decided to flee the stock. Year-to-date, shares are down 18.4%, but over the last year shares have fallen 45.5%.It's dirt cheap, even with the earnings cuts. It's trading with a forward P/E of just 7.Mosaic is also generating plenty of free cash flow. Mosaic is standing by its 2023 Capital Allocation Strategy, which is to return largely all of the 2023 free cash flow back to shareholders.In the first quarter, that meant $608 million was returned through share repurchases and dividends. It's dividend is currently yielding 2.3%.Fertilizers are a commodity. It's a challenging industry in which to invest.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold According to Billionaire Carl Icahn. Carl Icahn, recognized for his expertise in the financial market, faced another blow on May 10 as the shares of his holding company experienced a significant decline. This drop in value occurred after Hindenburg Research, a short seller, released a damning report, resulting in a total valuation decrease of over $6 billion since the attack. On May 10 alone, CNBC mentioned that the shares plummeted by 15.1%, following a nearly 25% loss the previous week. On May 9, Hindenburg made allegations against Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP), claiming that the company had inflated the value of its holdings and relied on a structure resembling a ""Ponzi scheme"" to distribute dividends. CNBC reported that Icahn Enterprises said in its latest 10-Q filing:“The U.S. Attorney’s office has not made any claims or allegations against us or Mr. Icahn with respect to the foregoing inquiry.”According to a report by The Street, Hindenburg's note to investors stated that Icahn’s last winning year was 2013, when the fund outperformed the market and returned 30.8%. From 2014 onwards, Carl Icahn's investment portfolio has experienced a decline of 53%, says Hindenburg. Meanwhile, during the same timeframe, the S&amp;P index has generated a return of 147%. According to Hindenburg's assessment, Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP) is described as paying out dividends that are ""mathematically unsustainable."" This conclusion is drawn from the fact that despite a negative free cash flow of $4.9 billion from 2014 onwards, the company has distributed $1.5 billion in cash dividends during that same period. Hindenburg further noted:""The company has supported its dividend and declining asset values by selling $1.7 billion through ATM (at the market) unit sales over the past four years... In short, Icahn has been using money from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors.""Story continuesCarl Icahn dismissed the report as biased and defended the accuracy of IEP's financial statements. Icahn is the majority owner of IEP, retaining approximately 85% of the company, and he has utilized more than 60% of his shares as collateral for personal loans. As a result of the Hindenburg report, Icahn's wealth has plummeted by $7.5 billion, leading to a final net worth of $10.8 billion for him, according to Forbes. In this article, we discuss the 15 top stocks to buy and hold according to billionaire Carl Icahn. These include FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Illumina What Is Illumina's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at April 2023 Illumina had debt of US$2.24b, up from US$1.74b in one year. However, it also had US$1.52b in cash, and so its net debt is US$718.0m.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Illumina's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Illumina had liabilities of US$2.23b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$2.89b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.52b and US$682.0m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$2.92b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Given Illumina has a humongous market capitalization of US$31.8b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Illumina can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Story continuesIn the last year Illumina had a loss before interest and tax, and actually shrunk its revenue by 4.4%, to US$4.4b. That's not what we would hope to see.Caveat EmptorImportantly, Illumina had an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) loss over the last year. Indeed, it lost US$21m at the EBIT level. Considering that alongside the liabilities mentioned above does not give us much confidence that company should be using so much debt. Quite frankly we think the balance sheet is far from match-fit, although it could be improved with time. However, it doesn't help that it burned through US$228m of cash over the last year. So to be blunt we think it is risky. When we look at a riskier company, we like to check how their profits (or losses) are trending over time. Today, we're providing readers this interactive graph showing how Illumina's profit, revenue, and operating cashflow have changed over the last few years.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home With this proxy fight, Mr. Icahn aligned himself with Lina Khan and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has ruled against the $7.1 billion deal. The Grail acquisition is one where Mr. Icahn has made one of his rare mistakes and, perhaps without realizing it, has taken sides with Ms. Khan in her bid to rewrite antitrust law. Other investors have been more supportive, calling the Grail acquisition a ""natural extension""  of Illumina’s technology and deeming it worth pursuing.It’s Ms. Khan and the FTC that Mr. Icahn should be targeting, not Illumina and its leadership. Instead of forcing the company to spend resources to respond to his proxy battle, Mr. Icahn could lend his resounding voice to the growing recognition that Ms. Khan’s view of anti-trust law is misguided.Mr. Icahn concedes Illumina is a “great company,” even though he is trying to get the CEO fired for buying Grail, the maker of a blood test that can detect more than 50 different types of cancer with few false positives.I’ve been following this case for professional and personal reasons. A cancer survivor and advisor to CEOs, I am alive only because of the early detection of my cancer and because I benefitted from cutting-edge technology in my treatment. I know first-hand the life-and-death difference these innovations represent.There are published accounts of doctors using Grail’s test to detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage, operating to remove the tumor, and patients returning to their normal lives. Doctors almost never find pancreatic cancer early. We all know family and friends who have died of this awful disease because we never find it until it has spread to other parts of the body and it is too late to stop. At scale, Grail is projected to save hundreds of thousands of lives.Story continuesIn this era of FTC overreach, the Illumina-Grail transaction would likely have merited little regulatory scrutiny. Ms. Khan, who was nominated “to make big structural change[s] by reviving antitrust enforcement,” according to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has tried to unwind the deal even though there is no U.S. law or legal precedent to justify barring this vertical transaction.The FTC’s decision has created regulatory uncertainty, contributing to the drop in Illumina’s stock, which, in turn, has enticed Mr. Icahn to buy a stake of about 1.5%  in a typical activist play.Meanwhile, Mr. Icahn’s activism has distracted from the most problematic issue here: the FTC’s attempts to use novel legal theories and tactics to sink a transaction.The FTC’s behavior, in this case, should concern every company with acquisition plans in the U.S. and Europe, given the great lengths Ms. Khan and the FTC have gone to partner with European regulators to smother this deal in its cradle.Consider these undeniable facts: FOIA requests have uncovered a flurry of communications between the FTC and European antitrust regulators, which were followed by the European Commission (EC) pursuing a novel theory of jurisdiction–and the FTC withdrawing its own federal lawsuit to stop the deal.Under the EU’s own laws, any EC review of the acquisition should be barred “because Grail has an insufficient nexus with the EU.” The EU is relying on a novel interpretation of the EU Merger Regulation for its jurisdiction and that interpretation is being challenged in the EU's highest court. In fact, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted recently, the EU is trying out this ""new and dramatically expanded application"" of the regulations against Illumina for the first time, “even though, both companies were headquartered outside the European Union and the ‘proposed transaction did not [otherwise] meet the thresholds of EU Merger Regulation.’”Because no one else makes a multi-cancer early detection blood test like Grail’s, the regulators’ quest to control this space is misguided. There is no other multi-cancer early detection test on the market in the U.S. and although a cancer detection test is available in parts of Europe, it tests for only a handful of cancers and uses a different technology that doesn’t rely on Illumina’s sequencing.The EC is making up new rules to regulate companies operating in nascent markets alongside non-existent competitors who have yet to develop any products and might never do so. By implication, that means there isn’t a merger transaction anywhere in the world that the EC can’t extend a long arm in to block if the EC’s action regarding Illumina stands.Why did the EU get involved? The FTC knows that U.S. courts likely would look askance at its speculative case against Illumina. When, after endless agency-manufactured delays, the FTC finally tried the case before one of its own in-house judges, the judge sided with Illumina, even though FTC judges almost always find for the home team.In fact, this was the first time ever that an FTC judge decided against the agency in a merger case, finding that combining the companies was not anti-competitive and that the FTC had failed to prove its case.  So, enlist European regulators to help further your grand design.It’s pretty clear that Illumina is a pawn in the FTC’s grander scheme. Its real objective is to set a precedent now by grinding down a smaller life sciences company so it can apply that precedent to large tech company mergers later. That is as unwise as it is unconscionable, injuring Illumina and all of its shareholders, including Mr. Icahn, in pursuit of “structural changes” in antitrust enforcement.With his activist play, Mr. Icahn has unwittingly played into Ms. Khan’s hands. Illumina must now fight on two fronts, but Illumina and Mr. Icahn should unite against their common foes: the FTC and Ms. Khan.Mark S.

The Annual Meeting will be held on May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time). Shareholders of record as of close of business on April 3, 2023, are entitled to vote at the meeting, no matter how many or how few shares they own.The full text of the letter follows:VOTE USING THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ILLUMINA'S NINE HIGHLY QUALIFIED DIRECTORSMay 18, 2023Fellow Shareholders,As Independent Chair of the Board of Illumina, I am writing today to share some reflections and my perspectives on the real ""state of Illumina"" as we quickly approach our contested Annual Meeting on May 25.My fellow directors and I have met with each of our top shareholders to describe our plan for the company and, most importantly, take and act on shareholder feedback. While support for the company is widespread, there is no doubt that a number of shareholders have had well-reasoned and pointed feedback for us as a Board, for Francis, and for the management team. We have heard these views and we understand the perspectives. While Illumina continues to strive to improve what is possible in healthcare, our financial results and shareholder returns have not met shareholder expectations, nor our own expectations for ourselves.Story continuesI will describe how we plan to address these issues, and how the Board will continue to drive accountability for each:On operating performance, we have challenged management to focus on topline growth acceleration and expanding margins. On April 25, 2023, the company announced a commitment to reduce annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million starting later this year, which will help accelerate operating margin improvements to 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025.1 These commitments are the result of a redoubling of efforts on operational excellence and we expect to achieve them without sacrificing our high-growth ambition.On core execution, we're ramping up the successful rollout of NovaSeqTM X, our breakthrough high-throughput sequencer which improves speed and throughput by 200% and 250%, respectively. The Board and management team are laser-focused on ensuring that we carry out this launch to its full promise (its order book shows the strongest pre-launch demand seen for any instrument) and that it paves the path for years of future growth.On GRAIL, it is innovative breakthrough technology that was launched at Illumina and will forever change the way early-stage cancer is detected, saving many lives. We recognize investor concerns about Illumina owning GRAIL and are re-evaluating our strategy to make an objective decision designed to maximize shareholder returns for this asset, including divesting if that is the best thing to do. That said, there is no faster path to resolution. This is a finite process ending in a decision by early 2024. Illumina would have to win both its U.S. and EU appeals in order to keep GRAIL. Even if we do win both appeals, we are committed to a full review of the total GRAIL opportunity, including potential synergies still achievable, before making a decision to keep GRAIL. The appeals processes do not impede preparatory divestiture work. A win in the EU appeal would remove any fines. A win in either the U.S. or EU appeal would nullify their respective divestiture order requirements.On conflicts of interest, there is an important question I would like to put to bed: ""Did any Illumina directors have a financial interest in GRAIL at the time of the acquisition?"" This question is not a matter of interpretation or explanation. The answer is simply no. As we have said before, no director who oversaw any part of the GRAIL transaction has ever owned any equity interest in GRAIL – that includes Jay Flatley, Francis deSouza, myself, and any member of the Board now or at the time of acquisition. In addition, no executive officers of Illumina held GRAIL shares at the signing or closing of the GRAIL acquisition (including indirect ownership interests such as through trusts, LP or GP stakes in investment vehicles, or through derivative securities), other than Alex Aravanis, who Illumina had hired from GRAIL, and Mostafa Ronaghi, Illumina's former CTO, who received GRAIL shares upon joining GRAIL's Board in May 2020. The economic interests and relationships of these individuals with GRAIL were fully disclosed to, and known by, Illumina and its Board, and, consistent with good corporate governance practices, both were recused from any decisions to sign and close the GRAIL acquisition. In addition, Illumina's Board engaged Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor in connection with the GRAIL acquisition and Goldman, acting exclusively for Illumina, delivered a customary fairness opinion to Illumina's Board immediately prior to Illumina entering into the GRAIL acquisition agreement.On Board refreshment, our nine directors bring extensive, deep and highly relevant experience as shareholder representatives. Illumina has an ongoing Board refreshment process and two years ago developed profiles for two new directors, based on the skills that would help Illumina achieve its strategic objectives over the next five years and beyond. The profiles are:Illumina engaged a specialized, external recruiter through a rigorous process which began with more than 85 candidates. The Board did not complete the evaluation process prior to the relevant deadlines for the upcoming Annual Meeting. So, the appointment of additional Board members will be subject to post-annual shareholder meeting Board approval and thereafter annual shareholder approval.In closing, let me reiterate – this Board is very clear about its shareholders' perspectives, expectations and governance priorities. We are committed to delivering results consistent with the high standards of performance and value creation expected of us by shareholders and our own standards for excellence.Shareholder democracy is perhaps the most fundamental tenet of American public equity markets and it is in the spirit of that tradition that I ask you today to support our Board with a vote on the white card for all nine company nominees.Thank you for your support.John W.

Illumina does not undertake any obligation to update these statements unless required by applicable laws or regulations, and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Among the important factors to which our business is subject that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements are: (i) changes in the rate of growth in the markets we serve; (ii) the volume, timing and mix of customer orders among our products and services; (iii) our ability to adjust our operating expenses to align with our revenue expectations; (iv) our ability to manufacture robust instrumentation and consumables; (v) the success of products and services competitive with our own; (vi) challenges inherent in developing, manufacturing, and launching new products and services, including expanding or modifying manufacturing operations and reliance on third-party suppliers for critical components; (vii) the impact of recently launched or pre-announced products and services on existing products and services; (viii) our ability to modify our business strategies to accomplish our desired operational goals; (ix) our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future actions to streamline and improve our R&amp;D processes, reduce our operating expenses and maximize our revenue growth; (x) our ability to further develop and commercialize our instruments, consumables, and products, including Galleri™, the cancer screening test developed by GRAIL, to deploy new products, services, and applications, and to expand the markets for our technology platforms; (xi) the risks and costs associated with our ongoing inability to integrate GRAIL due to the interim measures imposed on us by the European Commission as a result of their prohibition of our acquisition of GRAIL; (xii) the risks and costs associated with the integration of GRAIL's business if we are ultimately able to integrate GRAIL; (xiii) the risk that disruptions from the consummation of our acquisition of GRAIL and associated legal or regulatory proceedings, including related appeals, or obligations will harm our business, including current plans and operations; (xiv) the risk of incurring fines associated with the consummation of our acquisition of GRAIL and the possibility that we may be required to divest all or a portion of the assets or equity interests of GRAIL on terms that could be materially worse than the terms on which we acquired GRAIL; (xv) our ability to obtain approval by third-party payors to reimburse patients for our products; (xvi) our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our products from government agencies; (xvii) our ability to successfully partner with other companies and organizations to develop new products, expand markets, and grow our business; (xviii) uncertainty, or adverse economic and business conditions, including as a result of slowing or uncertain economic growth, COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures, or armed conflict; (xix) the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments and (xx) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, together with the factors set forth in Illumina's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2023 under the caption ""Risk Factors"", in information disclosed in public conference calls, the date and time of which are released beforehand, and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") including, among others, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.Additional Information and Where to Find ItIllumina has filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, containing a form of WHITE proxy card, with respect to its solicitation of proxies for Illumina's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) FILED BY ILLUMINA AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ANY SOLICITATION. Investors and security holders may obtain copies of these documents and other documents filed with the SEC by Illumina free of charge through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. Copies of the documents filed by Illumina are also available free of charge by accessing Illumina's website at www.illumina.com.Note regarding GRAILThe European Commission adopted an order on September 6, 2022 prohibiting Illumina's acquisition of GRAIL. We have filed an appeal of the Commission's decision. The Commission has also adopted an order requiring Illumina and GRAIL to be held and operated as distinct and separate entities for an interim period. Compliance with the order is monitored by an independent Monitoring Trustee. During this period, Illumina and GRAIL are not permitted to share confidential business information unless legally required, and GRAIL must be run independently, exclusively in the best interests of GRAIL. Commercial interactions between the two companies must be undertaken at arm's length.Statement regarding use of non–GAAP financial measuresThe company only provides non–GAAP measures for operating margin targets because of the difficulty of projecting with reasonable certainty the financial impact of specific GAAP operating adjustments, such as acquisition–related expenses, gains and losses from our strategic investments, fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration and contingent value rights, potential future asset impairments, restructuring activities, and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, inherently difficult to predict, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP measures for the operating margin target periods. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.ParticipantsIllumina, its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees will be participants in the solicitation of proxies with respect to a solicitation by Illumina. Information about Illumina's executive officers and directors, including information regarding the direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, is available in Illumina's definitive proxy statement for its 2023 Annual Meeting, which was filed with the SEC on April 20, 2023. To the extent holdings by our directors and executive officers of Illumina securities reported in the proxy statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting have changed, such changes have been or will be reflected on Statements of Change in Ownership on Forms 3, 4 or 5 filed with the SEC.

ILMN recently recognized the progress and impact of genomic technologies on pathogen preparedness and response. Driven by the improved sequencing infrastructure and pandemic-generated capabilities, public health agencies and healthcare systems can better respond to pathogenic threats by using the capabilities of genomic technologies.The pandemic accelerated the adoption of genomic surveillance to support global response and reduced barriers for sharing data internationally.Significance of Genomic SurveillanceWHO identifies genomic surveillance as ""the process of constantly monitoring pathogens and analyzing their genetic similarities and differences.” Since the onset of the pandemic, ILMN's pathogen genomic surveillance solutions were deployed to understand the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This is likely to have acted as a catalyst for the development and updates to vaccines and diagnostics, identified virus variants of concern and monitored the virus's evolution and spread.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRecently, WHO declared COVID-19 as no longer a public health emergency. However, individuals, communities and economies continue to be deeply impacted by the pandemic. This calls for continued vigilance by public health agencies and access to testing, genomic surveillance, vaccines and necessary treatments.Genomics plays a profound role in robust surveillance efforts. Per a representative at Illumina, the company is putting up significant work globally to build capacity and capabilities to enable pandemic preparedness and response. By enabling the comprehensive characterization of circulating pathogens, ILMN can investigate potential threats, rapidly respond with countermeasures and ultimately save lives.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global genomics market size was valued at $28.1 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 16.5% up to 2030.Recent DevelopmentsEarlier in April 2023, Illumina and the Detroit-based not-for-profit healthcare organization Henry Ford Health, announced a partnership to assess the impact of comprehensive genomic testing on cardiovascular diseases. The first study under this partnership, CardioSeq, includes 1,500 patients receiving care from the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Henry Ford.Story continuesIn the same month, Illumina announced that it received the international privacy certification for six of its cloud-based informatics programs. This recognizes the company’s compliance with robust, international data privacy requirements.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Illumina has mostly underperformed its industry.

For example, on March 23, Barclays Investment Bank analyst Anthony Powell downgraded SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) from Equal-Weight to Underweight. SL Green closed at $21.37 the previous day, but on the day of the downgrade, it closed at $19.49, down 8.7%.The reverse is also true, in that analyst upgrades can cause stocks to spike higher quickly. But on this day, apartment REITs were set to sell off following Rosivach’s report. Take a look at the four REITs that were downgraded by this analyst:Essex Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: ESS): Rosivach downgraded Essex Property Trust from Peer Perform to Underperform.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA): He downgraded Mid-America Apartment Communities from Peer Perform to Underperform, while announcing a price target of $137.UDR Inc. (NYSE: UDR): Rosivach downgraded UDR from Outperform to Peer Perform and announced a price target of $71.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT): Rosivach downgraded Camden Property Trust from Outperform to Peer Perform.Shortly after Rosivach’s downgrade, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein also downgraded Camden Property Trust from Buy to Neutral, while cutting the previous price target from $132 to $121.The downgrades are interesting because recently these REITs had performed well according to first-quarter operating results and had received favorable ratings from other analysts.At the end of April, JMP Securities reiterated a Market Outperform on Mid-America Apartment, and RBC Capital Markets maintained a Sector Perform rating on it. Mid-America Apartment increased its first-quarter funds from operations (FFO) from $1.97 to $2.28 year over year, beating its first-quarter 2022 revenue by 11.12% and beating the analysts’ estimates on revenue.Story continuesTruist Securities maintained a Hold position on UDR and raised the price target from $43 to $46. UDR’s first-quarter adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was $0.57, up from $0.55 in the first quarter of 2022.Recently two other analysts reported favorable views on Camden Property Trust. RBC Capital reiterated an Outperform rating and a $130 price target, and Stifel maintained a Buy rating. Camden Property Trust had a great first-quarter earnings report, as Core FFO more than doubled from $0.76 to $1.66 year over year.As for Essex Property Trust, in early May, Piper Sandler upgraded Essex Property Trust from Neutral to Overweight and raised its price target from $242 to $271. RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating and raised its price target from $247 to $250. Essex Property Trust also had a good first quarter, with FFO rising from $3.37 to $3.65 year over year.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketGiven the favorable ratings by other analysts, along with good first-quarter earnings and strong performances by the group, why would analyst Rosivach downgrade all four of these apartment REITs?It was because in looking ahead, he has expectations of an apartment sector slowdown. In his report to clients, he noted, “We think spring rent growth will have a challenging time keeping up with last year's blistering pace.""His forecast for the group is as follows:Essex Properties’ leasing spreads are now decelerating, with earnings growth of only 3% this year and 0% in 2024.For Camden Property, he sees earnings growth slowing to 6% in 2023 and 3% in 2024.UDR is forecast to have 8% growth this year but decline to 3% in 2024.Mid-America Apartments should have 2023 earnings growth of 9% but only 2% in 2024.It’s a brave call since 30-year mortgage interest rates are still in the mid-6 % range, deterring many renters from wanting or being able to buy a home. But 2022 saw large apartment rent increases, and despite cost increases, it will be difficult for landlords to keep tenants in place if they continue to raise rents at that pace. In the first half of 2022, the average price hike for new tenants was 12.2%. The 2022 median U.S. rent was up 5% to $2,305 per month.Still, Wall Street looks ahead, and many expect mortgage rates to decline if the Federal Reserve rate hikes in a continued effort to temper inflation. Should the economy fall into a recession, the interest rates and home prices would probably decline even further.For those who own any of these apartment REITs, Monday morning provides a wake-up call to how difficult it can be sometimes to own stocks. Mid-America was down 1.73% in the early going, and Camden Property Trust was down 1.23%. The other two REITs were also trading lower but by smaller amounts.What should investors do now? They should definitely not panic sell simply because of an analyst downgrade. Continue to do your own research and remember that the best analysts are only correct about half the time. In the example cited before where SL Green dropped to $19.49 following its downgrade, shares rebounded within a few days and by mid-April, SL Green was up near $26 per share.

NASA under that program said it could pick up to two companies, but blamed budget constraints for only going with SpaceX.This new contract offers a second chance for Bezos, who since founding Blue Origin in 2000 has invested billions into the company to compete for high-profile commercial and government space contracts with SpaceX, a dominant force in satellite launches and human spaceflight.After losing in 2021, Blue Origin unsuccessfully fought to overturn NASA's decision to ignore its Blue Moon lander, first with a watchdog agency and then in court.Blue Origin and lawmakers had pressured NASA to award a second lunar lander contract to promote commercial competition and ensure the agency has a backup ride to the moon. NASA in early 2022 announced the program for a second lander contract.NASA chief Bill Nelson said at the time: ""I promised competition, so here it is.""Blue Origin has said little about its latest moon lander proposal beyond naming its corporate partners: Lockheed Martin , Boeing, spacecraft software firm Draper, and robotics firm Astrobotic.Northrop Grumman, previously a key partner in Blue Origin's unsuccessful Blue Moon bid in 2021, switched teams to join its former rival Dynetics.NASA's multi-spacecraft plan for the Artemis moonshots involves its Space Launch System rocket launching astronauts toward the moon aboard the Lockheed-built Orion capsule. That will dock in space with a lunar lander that will ferry the crew the rest of the way to the moon's surface. (Reporting by Joey Roulette, editing by Ben Klayman and Nick Zieminski)]"

Tech is booming, financials are lagging and everything in between is a mixed bag. This is frustrating, especially as some once dominant stocks continue to fall to new lows. This has created some stocks with big red flags that could crash.Many strong businesses that are household names are seeing their share prices continue to slump as the market contends with a range of issues that include high interest rates, failing banks and a looming debt crisis in Congress. In such a volatile stock market, investors need to steer clear of troubled stocks and avoid risking capital unnecessarily. While we are sure to eventually enter a new bull market where a rising tide lifts all boats, we are not there yet. Here is a warning and three stocks to avoid with big red flags that could tank your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalt Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been a troubled stock for some time now, and the situation appears to be getting worse. The latest blow came when the House of Mouse reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on May 10. DIS stock fell 9% after the earnings print as the company disclosed that it lost four million subscribers at its Disney+ streaming service during the quarter which ended March 31. Sure, the company’s theme parks saw their revenue rise 17% year-over-year, but all anyone seems to care about is the streaming subscriptions.Two years ago, DIS stock was trading at just under $200 and flirting with an all-time high. Since then, the share price has plunged 53%. To be fair, Disney CEO Bob Iger is undertaking a massive restructuring of the company that has included 7,000 job cuts, with more layoffs likely to come. The company did announce plans to add Hulu content to the Disney+ streaming service, while also raising the price of its ad-free tier. In time, these changes, and others, could turn Disney around. The question is how much pain can shareholders endure?Story continuesModerna (MRNA)Moderna (MRNA) research Coronavirus (Covid 19) vaccine. Row of vaccine bottles with blurred Moderna company logo on background.Source: Carlos l Vives / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of once high-flying stocks that have fallen on hard times, we have pharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). This stock was a pandemic darling as the company raced to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to the masses. MRNA stock rose 1,500% between March 2020 and September 2021. However, with most of the world now vaccinated against the respiratory disease, and with no other vaccines or medications commercially available, Moderna’s stock has plunged 72% and continues to slide lower.This is an unfortunate turn of events as Moderna’s mRNA vaccines are truly cutting edge and innovative. However, the company and its shareholders are suffering due to a thin product pipeline. To date, the Covid-19 vaccine has been the only pharmaceutical that Moderna has successfully brought to market. While the company is developing treatments for other diseases such as cancer, as well as a vaccine that reportedly protects against both Covid-19 and influenza, it’s not clear when or if those medications will make it to consumers.Nike (NKE)NKE stock: A photograph of the storefront of a Nike store.Source: Square Box Photos / Shutterstock.comWhat’s disappointing about Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock is that it hasn’t done much of anything lately. Year-to-date, Nike shares are only up 3%. This is frustrating as the company continues to report better-than-expected earnings and retains a commanding share of the sneaker and athletic apparel market. At the end of March, Nike announced earnings per share of 79 cents versus 55 cents that was expected. Additionally, revenue totaled $12.39 billion compared to $11.47 billion that was forecast.Despite a string of strong earnings, NKE stock is stuck in neutral. This is due to two issues, slumping sales in China and the continued wind down of excessive inventory. Nike said sales in China, its third-biggest market by revenue, fell 8% during the most recent quarter to $1.99 billion. China’s Covid-19 policies have hurt Nike’s sales in the country of 1.4 billion people. Also, Nike said its gross margins declined to 43.3%, a decrease of 3.3%, due to higher markdowns and promotions used to liquidate its inventory.Both the issues in China and the company’s bloated inventory are sure to resolve themselves in time. How long it takes remains a question mark shaped cloud hanging over NKE stock.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in DIS.

Here with the latest, Yahoo Finance health reporter Anjalee Khemlani. Anj, you've been listening in. You just pulled your earbuds out. What are we hearing?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: We just got the vote in. So hot off the press, we got a majority of the votes in for Pfizer's maternal RSV vaccine and that's 14 to 0 vote on approving it-- or recommending approval based on the efficacy of the vaccine. But we did get a 10 to 4 vote on voting for on recommendation on the safety profile of the vaccine. I'm going to get to that in just a second.But just to recap, what we're looking at with Pfizer's vaccine, it is a 120 microgram dose administered to pregnant mothers between the weeks of 24 to 36 weeks. It protects the baby up to six months. That's at least the endpoint that they had notified and it met that endpoint. We noted that in the data, number one, that later in the third trimester is when it seemed to have the best efficacy as well as strongest protection up to 30 days versus after that.Now, Pfizer is competing with GlaxoSmithKline for RSV vaccines. We did note specifically that GSK actually dropped out or paused their phase III because of certain safety signals, which you can see, of course, indicated in those votes there, specifically on preterm birth. Pfizer noted 5.6% in their vaccine group versus 4.7% in placebo. GlaxoSmithKline noted 6.8% in their vaccine group versus 4.9% in placebo. So the placebo numbers are pretty close.They also do have some similar indications. One major difference is that GlaxoSmithKline's group also had neonatal deaths reported. So that was a significant safety signal as well and that's what started that pause.So as it stands right now, Pfizer looks like it's clear for at least a recommendation for a yes vote from the FDA. They are still waiting on the FDA to decide on their older adult vaccine for RSV. They also do have that up for-- waiting for a vote from the FDA.Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline was the first to get the 16 and older RSV vaccine out. So neck and neck really when it comes to it, but Pfizer is the only one on the table right now with a maternal vaccine. So as this moves forward, it'll be the first.SEANA SMITH: All right, we'll continue to watch out. Anj, thanks so much.]"

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted that the available data support the efficacy and safety of its unadjuvanted bivalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F vaccine candidate RSVpreF or PF-06928316. The Committee voted 14 to 0 on effectiveness and 10 to 4 on safety. The vaccine candidate is currently under FDA review for the prevention of medically attended lower respiratory tract disease (MA-LRTD) and severe MA-LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals.""We are encouraged by the outcome of today’s VRBPAC meeting as it is a critical step forward in the scientific community’s long-sought-after goal to help prevent RSV disease in infants during their most vulnerable first six months of life,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""If approved, our RSV vaccine candidate has the potential to be the first maternal immunization vaccine to help protect infants at first breath through their first six months of life from this potentially serious infection.""The VRBPAC based its recommendation on the scientific evidence shared by Pfizer, including primary analysis results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04424316) MATISSE (MATernal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy) announced in November 2022. These results were also recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Story continuesThe role of the VRBPAC is to provide recommendations to the FDA; however, these recommendations are not binding. The FDA’s decision on the potential approval of RSVpreF for the prevention of MA-LRTD and severe MA-LRTD caused by RSV in infants by active immunization of pregnant individuals is expected by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date in August 2023.Burden of RSV in InfantsRSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness.1 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual and can potentially cause severe illness in young infants, older adults, and individuals with certain chronic medical conditions.2,3,4In the United States, approximately 500,000 to 600,000 cases of MA-LRTD due to RSV occur annually in infants less than 12 months of age.5 Worldwide, there are an estimated 6.6 million cases of RSV annually in infants less than six months of age, with approximately 45,000 dying each year from complications associated with the infection, and the vast majority in developing countries.6,7,8About RSVpreFPfizer is currently the only company pursuing regulatory applications for an RSV investigational vaccine candidate for both an older adult indication, as well as a maternal indication to help protect infants through maternal immunization.In December 2022, Pfizer announced that the FDA had granted priority review to a biologics license application for RSVpreF for the prevention of RSV disease in older adults with a decision on whether or not to approve RSVpreF expected by thePDUFA goal date later this month. This was followed by the February 2023 vote by VRBPAC in support of the safety and effectiveness of RSVpreF in adults 60 years of age and older. The FDA’s VRBPAC based its recommendation on the scientific evidence shared by Pfizer, including interim data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05035212) RENOIR (RSV vaccine Efficacy study iN Older adults Immunized against RSV disease). Top-line results for RENOIR were previously announced by Pfizer in August 2022 and presented at IDWeek and the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in October 2022, as well as recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine.In February 2023, it was announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review Pfizer’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) under accelerated assessment for RSVpreF, as submitted for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. The formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) currently is ongoing. Also in February 2023, Pfizer Japan announced an application was filed with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for RSVPreF as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. In April 2023, Pfizer Canada announced Health Canada accepted RSVpreF for review for both individuals ages 60 and older and as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV.Earlier this month, Pfizer also announced it would be initiating multiple clinical trials evaluating RSVpreF in healthy children ages 2-5; children ages 5-18 with underlying medical conditions; adults ages 18-60 at high-risk due to underlying medical conditions; and adults ages 18 and older who are immunocompromised and at high-risk for RSV.9Pfizer’s investigational RSV vaccine candidate builds on foundational basic science discoveries including those made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which detailed the crystal structure of prefusion F, a key form of the viral fusion protein (F) that RSV uses to enter human cells. The NIH research showed that antibodies specific to the prefusion form were highly effective at blocking virus infection, suggesting a prefusion F-based vaccine may confer optimal protection against RSV. After this important discovery, Pfizer tested numerous versions of a stabilized prefusion F protein and identified a candidate that elicited a strong anti-viral immune response in pre-clinical evaluations. The bivalent vaccine candidate is composed of equal amounts of recombinant RSV prefusion F from subgroups A and B.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

An estimated 58,000 to 80,000 children below the age of five years are hospitalized due to RSV infection annually in the United States, according to government data.The FDA, which is not obligated to follow the recommendations of the advisory panel but usually does, is expected to make an approval decision by August.The FDA's staff reviewers on Tuesday deemed the safety data for Pfizer's vaccine ""generally favorable"".If approved, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will then need to sign off on its use to make it widely available to pregnant mothers.Pfizer is counting on new medicines and vaccines to help offset declining revenue from its COVID-19 products.Though FDA staffers flagged a higher number of pre-term births among participants taking the Pfizer shot in a clinical trial compared to those who received a placebo, the FDA said the difference was not statistically significant, so that may have occurred by chance.But some panelists expressed concern about the potential link.Story continues""I worry that if preterm births are in anyway a consequence of this vaccine that would be tragic in many ways,"" said Paul Offit, director of vaccine education center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who was one of the no votes on safety.Dr. Daniel Feikin, a respiratory diseases specialist and temporary voting member of the panel, was less concerned. ""I'm not convinced that there's a clear causal relationship between this vaccine and preterm birth,"" he said.Demand for a maternal RSV vaccine could be limited compared to other childhood vaccinations that are often mandated for attending schools, said pediatric expert on RSV Dr. Jonathan Miller of Nemours Children's Health, ahead of the meeting.While there is no maternal RSV vaccine available in the United States, GSK Plc earlier this month became the first to secure U.S. approval of an RSV shot for older adults. The FDA is expected to decide on Pfizer's vaccine for the older age group later this month.Pfizer has said it is ready to launch its RSV vaccine for both older adults and pregnant women in the United States and Europe later this year. Analysts have estimated the market for RSV vaccines to surpass $10 billion by 2030.Data from the Pfizer vaccine's late-stage trial had shown it was 82% effective in preventing severe infections in infants when given to expecting mothers in the second half of their pregnancy.""If the vaccine actually lives up to the data that we've seen today. I can guarantee that many infants and their parents will breathe easier in the coming years,"" said Jay Portnoy, one of FDA panelists.(Reporting by Raghav Mahobe and Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

At age 6 months, it still was proving 69% protective against severe illness.Pfizer said there were no signs of safety problems but the FDA did ask its scientific advisers to consider whether a slight difference in premature birth between vaccinated moms and those given a dummy shot was of concern. Debate over whether that was really a hint of trouble or just due to chance dominated the panel's daylong meeting.Pfizer pledged to closely track the vaccine's real-world use for more evidence. Ultimately the advisers unanimously decided that the shot is effective — and voted 10-4 that there's adequate safety data. The FDA will consider Thursday's recommendations in making the final decision on approval.“If you’re in any sense risking premature births with this vaccine, I think there will be a big price to pay,” said Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, among the panelists who voted “no” on the safety question.Story continuesIf the FDA ultimately approves the maternal shot, it would mark a second milestone in the decades-long quest to prevent the respiratory syncytial virus. Earlier this month the FDA approved the world’s first RSV vaccine, rival GSK’s shot for older adults, who also are at high risk. There isn't a vaccine yet for children, but Pfizer is about to begin testing one.Here are some things to know:RSV IS A COMMON THREATFor most healthy people, RSV is a cold-like nuisance. But it can be life-threatening for the very young –- infecting deep in the lungs to cause pneumonia or impeding babies’ breathing by inflaming their tiny airways. In the U.S. alone, between 58,000 and 80,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized each year, and between 100 and 300 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“All young infants are at risk of severe disease with RSV,” but postponing infection even by a few months lessens that risk, said CDC’s Dr. Katherine Fleming-Dutra.VACCINE’S POTENTIAL IMPACTPfizer’s vaccine isn’t intended to prevent RSV infection but to avoid the worst outcomes. In late-stage testing, six infants born to vaccinated mothers had a severe RSV illness in their first three months of life compared to 33 infants whose mothers received a dummy shot. In addition, the vaccine cut in half the chances of needing any medical attention for an RSV infection by age 6 months.The company predicts the U.S. could prevent as many as 20,000 infant hospitalizations a year, and 320,000 doctor visits, if enough pregnant women were vaccinated.SAFETY DATAVaccine reactions included typically mild injection-site pain and fatigue. As for the prematurity question, vaccinated mothers had slightly more preterm infants –- 5.7% versus 4.7%. The vast majority were born just a few weeks early. That’s better than the nation’s preterm birth rate -- overall in the U.S., 1 in 10 babies were born premature last year –- and the study imbalance wasn’t statistically significant, meaning it could be due to chance.Competitor GSK halted its own trials of a maternal RSV vaccine because of prematurity concerns, spurring questions about Pfizer's shot. Pfizer said the preterm difference in its study was fueled by participants in South Africa — for unknown reasons — and there was no difference spotted in the U.S. or other high-income countries.“Do you hold hostage the potential benefits of the vaccine” without clear evidence of a problem, Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president, asked the panelists.“There is certainty that the vaccine works and will keep infants out of the hospital in the United States as soon as this winter,” he said.A total of 17 infants died during the study, five born to vaccinated mothers and 12 to those given a dummy shot. Researchers deemed none of the deaths related to the vaccine but FDA said it “is unable to exclude the possibility” that one infant’s death, stemming from extreme prematurity, might be related.Vaccines always get close safety scrutiny but regulators are especially mindful of a major setback in the 1960s when an experimental RSV shot worsened infections in children. Eventually scientists figured out the problem and the RSV vaccines in the pipeline today are made with safer, modern methods -- yet still were tested first in older adults.ANOTHER OPEN QUESTIONFDA's advisers also cautioned that it's not clear which other vaccines given to pregnant women can be administered during the same doctor's visit. They pointed to data suggesting that a vaccine against whooping cough doesn't seem as strong if pregnant women receive it at the same time as the RSV shot.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?FDA’s advisers already have recommended approving Pfizer’s vaccine for older adults, and the agency is expected to make a decision by month’s end. Whether to use the same shot in pregnant women will be a separate FDA decision, expected in August.Meanwhile, rival GSK is gearing up for fall immunizations with its RSV vaccine for seniors. First, the CDC's advisers will debate next month whether all older adults or only those at high risk need vaccination.Vaccines aren’t the only advance in the pipeline. High-risk infants can get monthly doses of a protective drug during RSV season, although CDC data shows too few receive it. European regulators recently approved the first one-dose option, from Sanofi and AstraZeneca, opening that type of protection to more infants.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 most prescribed medication in the world.The advancements that the medical field has accomplished over the past century, and especially in recent decades, has exponentially raised our standard of living. Not only are people living longer, with the World Economic Forum stating that life expectancy at birth for both sexes has increased from 46.5 years in 1950 to 71.7 years in 2022, but the quality of living has improved dramatically too, with new innovations being implemented every year. Whether it's the Covid-19 vaccine that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), which are also among the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, have come up with in record time to potentially save tens of millions of lives and reduce the burden on the global health structure, to companies such as Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) and ViiV (a majority-owned company by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK)), which have dramatically improved the lives of people living with HIV and people susceptible to HIV, medication's importance cannot be understated.In most developed countries healthcare is free. Taxes and deductions from everyone's earnings ensure a social, universal healthcare system which allows everyone to afford the treatment. Furthermore, in most European, and other countries, drug prices are regulated by governments to make sure that they remain affordable for the general masses and maintain a balance between profits for the company and affordable healthcare for residents. The one major exception is, as you've probably guessed, the United States of America.25 most prescribed medication in the worldPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashEven though the United States is the biggest economy in the world, and has been for around a century now, healthcare has still remained mostly in private hands. While that has allowed businesses and R&amp;D to flourish as costs have been recouped through higher drug prices, this has had the consequence of making many types of medication unaffordable for people who desperately need it to survive. Most people are only afforded healthcare insurance through their employer, which means that if a person becomes unemployed, not only do they lose out on their income, healthcare becomes almost impossible to afford as well. Since there is no governmental oversight, prices for drugs can be increased massively, with RAND Corporation stating that prescription drug prices in the country are 2.56 times than those of 32 other countries. If the focus is only on brand prices, the discrepancy rises even further, with U.S. prices being 3.44 times higher than in other nations. According to a senior healthy policy research at RAND, Andrew Mulcahy: ""Brand-name drugs are the primary driver of the higher prescription drug prices in the United States. We found consistently high U.S. brand name prices regardless of our methodological decisions.” The only relatively positive fact for the U.S. is that generic drug prices are actually just 84% of those in other countries. The same study also found out that France, Italy and the United Kingdom had the lowest drug prices among G7 nations while Canada, Germany and Japan have the highest prices.Story continuesOne recent, glaring example is the price of insulin manufactured by pharma giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). The last two decades saw a 300% increase in the price of insulin, which led to many people in the U.S. being forced to hoard rations, even if they have insurance. Recently, after significant pressure and public discourse, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced a 70% reduction in price and capping patient out-of-pocket expenses at $35 a month. One of the primary reasons behind this decision was President Biden's announcement in January 2023 that insulin would be capped at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare. While the announcement has been welcomed almost universally, others have raised the practice of price-gouging, citing the fact that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) could reduce prices by 70% and still turn a profit.To determine the most prescribed medication, we headed over to ClinCalc, which uses data provided by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for each year, and finds out the total prescriptions and total patients for a drug in a given year. There can be some variance in the two; for example, an HIV drug which has to be taken every single day will have more prescriptions than a drug which has to be taken once a month. Therefore, we have taken the average of both to come up with our ranking. So, let's now take a look at the drugs being consumed the most across the world, starting with:25. MeloxicamTotal prescriptions: 19,808,581Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory medicine that is administered either orally or intravenously. It is generally used for pain treatment in rheumatic diseases and osteoarthritis.24. TamsulosinTotal prescriptions: 24,692,402Tamsulosin is used to treat symptoms of a large prostate and is sold under various brand names. Generally sold under the brand name Flomax, it is also often used to help a patient pass kidney stones.23. TrazodoneTotal prescriptions: 26,210,731Trazodone is an antidepressant sold under several brand names.22. PrednisoneTotal prescriptions: 19,044,926Prednisone is used for the replacement of steroids which are normally produced by the body. It suppresses the immune system and decreases inflammation in various conditions.21. BupropionTotal prescriptions: 28,889,368One of several antidepressant medications among the most prescribed medication in the world, Bupropion is sold under the brand name Wellbutrin, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK).20. PantoprazoleTotal prescriptions: 26,604,040Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used in the treatment of stomach ulcers, by reducing the amount of acid the stomach makes.19. FurosemideTotal prescriptions: 26,786,296Furosemide is a diuretic and is used in the treatment of high blood pressure and heart conditions. It can also help in peeing when the patient's kidneys are not working properly.18. FluticasoneTotal prescriptions: 24,777,490Fluticasone is a steroids medication used in the form of nasal spray and drops, and is used for the treatment of nasal symptom. Some of its popular brand names include Flixonase and Avamys, both of which are manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK).17. EscitalopramTotal prescriptions: 30,605,646Escitalopram is used to treat anxiety as well as depression, and in a world where mental health is finally being given more importance than it received historically, it should come as no surprise that such medication is among the most prescribed drugs in the world.16. RosuvastatinTotal prescriptions: 30,605,646Rosuvastatin is a high cholesterol treatment medication and is sold under the brand name Crestor in addition to various other brand names.15. MontelukastTotal prescriptions: 29,750,488Montelukast is a drug used to fight against asthma, and is perhaps best known under the brand name Singulair, manufactured by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).14. Acetaminophen; HydrocodoneTotal prescriptions: 30,100,356Acetaminophen is also known as paracetamol, even more well-known by brand names Tylenol and Panadol, manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Haleon plc (NYSE:HLN) respectively. It is generally used for the treatment of light pain such as headache and slight reduction in fever, even though ibuprofen has been proven to be more effective in this respect. Meanwhile, hydrocodone is an opioid. Together, a combination of these two drugs is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain in patients.13. SertralineTotal prescriptions: 38,219,814You might not have heard of Sertraline, even though it is one of the most prescribed drugs in the world, but you will definitely have heard of Zoloft, perhaps the most consumed antidepressant brand named drug, which is manufactured by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE).12. SimvastatinTotal prescriptions: 36,600,871Simvastatin, used to treat high cholesterol, is sold under the brand name Zocor, manufactured by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).11. HydrochlorothiazideTotal prescriptions: 41,476,098One of the oldest drugs still heavily in use, Hydrochlorothiazide has been around for over half a century and is a diuretic which is used to treat hypertension and swelling as a result of fluid build-up.Click to continue reading and see the 10 most prescribed medication in the world.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis, then visit 10 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the World.After COVID-19, 2023 will likely be a gloomier year for technology. Due to geopolitical and economic instability, the next stage of technology growth is being handled with greater caution. Leaders will need to find ways to accomplish more with fewer resources, see opportunities where innovations collide, and choose wisely which technologies to invest in when they approach a tipping point.Market OutlookNumerous technological developments that might alter the way we work and live in 2022 have been identified. These included innovations in clean energy technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual reality. The challenge for CEOs in 2023 for top companies such as, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), will be to think about how all these technologies might open up new possibilities when they are utilized together, or what we refer to as combinatorial trends, rather than merely banking on individual trends or ramping up software engineering skills.Technology advances are crucial to the creation of smart cities. Urban settings may be made more effective, sustainable, and livable with the help of modern technology. Modern data-driven technologies can help address environmental issues, reduce resource consumption, optimize urban infrastructure, and improve the quality of life for city dwellers. Examples include digital water systems, smart grids, digital transportation, data-driven traffic management, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.However, there are challenges that should be considered and addressed, such as how fast urbanization might cause a housing crisis or how a lackluster internet infrastructure can cause sustainability problems. City planners may construct resilient, livable, and inclusive cities that successfully handle the issues of overcrowding and mass urban migration while enhancing the general quality of life for urban people by placing a high priority on holistic urban sustainability.Story continuesThe reality of the Metaverse will Change the Way We Work.The virtual world, or Metaverse, has undergone significant technological growth in recent years. Early estimates suggest that by 2031, the worldwide Metaverse's economic contribution may be worth above $3 trillion. Plans to use the Metaverse are already progressing in places like Seoul, Dubai, and more. New prospects are also emerging in an extensive variety of aspects, including training, remote work, education, and more.Additionally, the growth of the virtual world might result in a contribution of 1.7%, or $440 billion (€417 billion), to the global economy over the course of ten years.AI will Boost the Technological Trend in the FutureBusinesses may take advantage of quick access to data-driven information using AI at the Edge to quickly respond to business demands. Real-time patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare, effective traffic management in smart cities, preventative maintenance on the production line, etc., will all be made possible by AI at the edge. Lenovo's ThinkEdge SE450, for instance, is already reducing business complexity, boosting computational power in remote areas, addressing security concerns, and producing correct insights more quickly.Soon, AI-enabled Edge servers may examine multiple video feeds from store aisle cameras to look for large amounts of merchandise being removed at once and monitor deliveries to help retailers better manage their inventory and quickly cope with supply and demand, enhancing sales and earnings and ensuring consumers receive in return of their heavy investment.25 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the Worldyuttana Contributor Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our piece on the 25 most technologically advanced cities in the world, we determined the rankings based on various reliable sources such as the world economic forum (WEF) and Innovative cities index from ""IGI Global – Publisher of Timely Knowledge.” We will average the ranking from these sources to generate our own rankings. We have also discussed the number of tech companies and startups operating in those cities. We have relied on different sources for the number of tech startups, including Crunchbase, Startupblink, Wellfound, Startupgenome, among others.So, without further delay, let us examine the list of the 25 most technologically advanced cities globally.25. StockholmNumber of tech startups = 168There are about 101,000 ICT workers in Stockholm. Stockholm contains a number of distinctive and potent elements that encourage the creation of startups.Harald Overholm, a co-founder of Alight, a significant tech firm with over 50 distribution locations, as well as other businesspeople like Nina Siemiatkowski, the creator of Milywire, and Karl Rosander, the co-founder of Sesamy, noted that the city serves as the nation's primary technological ecosystem.24. JohannesburgNumber of tech startups = 204Johannesburg, which is known as the financial center of sub-Saharan Africa, is committed to developing via technology. The municipal planning committee has had cooperation with the IT industry, particularly in information and communications technology. For instance, in an effort to reduce crime, the city's police department went high-tech and installed CCTV cameras on every corner of the city's main thoroughfare.23. BeijingNumber of tech startups = 281Beijing has rapidly developed itself into a technological giant. The city's outstanding higher education system, reputable research foundation, and active government backing have helped it become a worldwide player in AI and sophisticated manufacturing. Beijing constructed 54,000 5G base stations in 2022 to attain basic gigabit internet access throughout the city and coverage in the 5G signal-free trade area.22. AmsterdamNumber of tech startups = 286With its high degree of connection and sophisticated broadband networks, Amsterdam has a very advanced digital infrastructure. Amsterdam was regarded as the 14th best startup environment worldwide in the ""Startup Genome Global Startup Ecosystem Report,"" with a heavy emphasis on fintech and biotech.21. BerlinNumber of tech startups = 500Berlin has long been a center for medical technological developments, in part because Germany was among the pioneers of the traditional universal health care system. It is the origin of globally renowned tech firms like SoundCloud and Delivery Hero, and the fintech, digital health, artificial intelligence, food technology, and cyber security sectors are also expanding in the city.20. MilanNumber of tech startups = 1,000Since 2012, Milan has created and accepted a number of plans in the fields of urban planning, sustainable transportation, energy conservation, the sharing economy, and smart cities. For instance, as part of a citywide e-mobility effort to minimize automobile ownership, E-bikes have been incorporated into Milan's BikeMi conventional bike network.19. ShanghaiNumber of tech startups = 1,000Shanghai provides prospects for scientific research in a range of fields, notably in the area of machine learning technology that benefits AWS users. Officials in Shanghai have reaffirmed their commitment to luring 20,000–30,000 AI experts to the Lingang Special Area, a section of the city's free-trade zone. The city now houses the most intelligent chip design businesses.18. TokyoNumber of tech startups = 1,501Tokyo, the capital of Japan, plans to develop a mini-city called Tokyo eSG that will be based on the concepts of environmental, social and governance concepts of ESG. Using innovative technologies, the city will become carbon-neutral and more resistant to impending health and climatic catastrophes.17. MunichNumber of tech startups = 1,800It should not be surprising that 10 out of the 30 companies included in the DAX stock index, including Adidas, Siemens, and BMW, are located in the region since Munich has one of the strongest economies in the nation. The German headquarters or research facilities of multinational corporations and IT behemoths like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are also located here.16. MadridNumber of tech startups = 2,200Madrid has recently established itself as one of the most important European locations for tech, despite the fact that it has not previously been regarded as a big European tech center. The considerable financing Madrid-based start-ups receive for their artistic endeavors is one of the causes of this development. Startups in Madrid received investments totaling €342 million in 2021 alone.15. SydneyNumber of tech startups = 2,300As Sydney's Tech Central becomes the hub of our growing technology industry and the location for risk-taking enterprises to invest, the city is quickly becoming the world's innovation engine. Sydney is the ninth most alluring city in the world for digital expertise and has the best startup environment in the southern hemisphere. Currently, there are more than 2,000 active startups, including some of the most prosperous corporations in the country.14. MumbaiNumber of tech startups = 9,354Mumbai has become one of India's top IT hubs, and other cities in Maharashtra are also following in its footsteps. Mumbai boasts more than 500 hotspots spread around the city that go by the moniker MumbaiWiFi. MumbaiWiFi is one of the largest public WiFi services in the world and the largest in India.13. San FranciscoNumber of tech startups = 3,183San Francisco is well-known for the heavy funding of a web-and-code training and job placement program that gives IT professionals job placement support, work experience chances, vocational skills training, and career promotion. San Francisco will continue to see creative growth thanks to this initiative.12. TorontoNumber of tech startups = 3,300With a significant concentration of tech firms and a welcoming climate for entrepreneurship, Toronto boasts a burgeoning startup ecosystem. Additionally, a number of significant IT firms, including International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), have set up AI research hubs in Toronto.11. DubaiNumber of tech startups = 3,400Due to a number of efforts, notably those involving 6G technology, that has been put out to aid in the transition to a cutting-edge digital economy, Dubai is ""well positioned"" to be at the vanguard of becoming a fully-fledged smart city. Dubai features a sophisticated traffic control system that decreases traffic congestion and emergency response times. By 2030, it also intends to have roughly 4,000 autonomous taxis operating on the roads.Click to continue reading and see 10 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the World.Suggest Articles:12 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics25 Least Developed Countries in the World25 Most Technologically Advanced Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 25 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, Molson Coors Canada Inc. (TSE:TPX.B) shareholders have seen the share price rise 58% over three years, well in excess of the market return (41%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 35% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Canada Given that Molson Coors Canada didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over the last three years Molson Coors Canada has grown its revenue at 37% annually. That's much better than most loss-making companies. The share price rise of 16% per year throughout that time is nice to see, and given the revenue growth, that gain seems somewhat justified. If that's the case, now might be the time to take a close look at Molson Coors Canada. A window of opportunity may reveal itself with time, if the business can trend to profitability.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthThis free interactive report on Molson Coors Canada's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Molson Coors Canada, it has a TSR of 66% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Molson Coors Canada shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 35% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 1.4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Molson Coors Canada .Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

165,22239e57-2ac9-4b06-895e-4ff13818ff89,GM,2023-05-19,"Tesla would be 'lucky' to keep Cybertruck price at $75,000, MotorTrend CEO says",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-would-be-lucky-to-keep-cybertruck-price-at-75000-motortrend-ceo-says-175857935.html,1684432737,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'RIVN', 'GM', 'STLA']","[New data from MotorTrend finds that electric vehicles are hot on their users’ buying lists. And one upcoming EV pickup truck could be the most polarizing.The motor magazine, TV network, and car-shopping site found that in the past year, 78% of active car shoppers are “very interested” in EVs at the moment, and that over the next five years nearly 50% of car shoppers say they will definitely or probably buy an electric or hybrid vehicle.“All of us, even the people who are watching right now are saying to themselves, ‘I know I'm going to get an EV, is it the right time?,” said Alex Wellen, president and CEO of the MotorTrend group in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “‘I don't know about the range anxiety, I don't know about how I'm going to charge it, is it affordable?,’ but everyone knows that they're going to be inside of an EV soon.”The inevitability of EVs in the car buyer’s mind seems to be growing by the day. And with the passage of the federal tax credit for EVs, and new models introduced every day, the pull to buy EVs is becoming more powerful. However, pricing may be an issue as the average cost for one soars to $55,000 on average.That being said, when drilling down over the data the most popular EV models on MotorTrend’s Buyer’s guide starts with, not surprisingly, the Tesla Model 3, followed by the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevy Bolt EV, Tesla Model Y, and Lucid Air.The Rivian R1T EV pickup (Rivian)But what’s more surprising is that the most popular EV (and and vehicle overall) brand searched on MotorTrend.com over the past year is Rivian, which had 22% more search volume than Tesla, and 67% more than Lucid.While the Rivian R1T pickup was named MotorTrend’s 2022 Truck of the Year, its relatively low sales volume, long waitlist, and high price make it a surprising top search term. But its capabilities, such as having four electric motors, 900 hp, and all-terrain abilities may have drawn curious EV shoppers in.Speaking of electric pickups — the one that’s getting the most heat recently is the Tesla Cybertruck, due for production later this year. MotorTrend users are definitely interested in it, but not without caveats.Story continues“From a design point of view it's very polarizing, and I think a lot of people just won't simply want it,” Wellen said, though he believes CEO Elon Musk has done a nice job of surprising doubters in the past, and should be close to as capable as the Rivian R1T.The Tesla Cybertruck (Tesla)But pricing will be key — and it’s here where the Cybertruck will have to thread the needle in a competitive space that also counts the Ford F-150 Lightning and soon the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ram 1500 REV EV.“Musk said in 2019, three and a half years ago that [the Cybertruck] would be $39,000 - I think eventually, like they did with the Model 3, they'll have a $39,000 truck,” Wellen said, but not right away. “But if they want to do three or four motors, I would say they would be lucky at $75,000.”With the dual-motor Rivian R1T starting around that price, it will be an interesting landscape if Tesla is able to make the Cybertruck and its tri-motor setup at $75,000.One thing is likely for sure, when the Cybertruck is finally out and available for sale, it just might become the most popular search term on the MotorTrend.com website — because of its fans as well as its haters.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors Co. GM, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, Unum Group's UNM, MGM Resorts International MGM and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Value Stocks to Buy Amid Recession ThreatsWe are in the middle of a volatile May after a solid April. Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metrics raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained range-bound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.General Motors Co. has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM's strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.The forward P/E of General Motors for the current financial year is 4.61X, lower than the industry average of 9.84X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.47, lower than the industry average of 1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last seven days. United Airlines Holdings Inc. is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. Our second-quarter total revenue estimate indicates a 14.7% year-over-year increase.For second-quarter 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve almost 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. UAL's focus on cargo revenues is encouraging. UAL's fleet-upgrade efforts are commendable as well.The forward P/E of United Airlines for the current financial year is 4.16X, lower than the industry average of 9.74X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.09, lower than the industry average of 0.28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last 30 days. Unum Group's conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. Sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience. The geographic expansion of UNM is paying off as acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K.We believe strong operating results have led to a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, boosting financial flexibility. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders' value. For the long term, it estimates premiums from core business to increase 3-5%. UNM estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.The forward P/E of Unum for the current financial year is 8.67X, lower than the industry average of 11.75X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.81, lower than the industry average of 1.49. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last seven days. MGM Resorts International is benefiting from increased business volume and travel activity, primarily at MGM China and Las Vegas Strip Resorts. The removal of COVID-related travel restrictions in Macau resulted in high contributions from the MGM China segment.MGM Resorts is also planning to expand its footprint in New York. MGM is optimistic regarding BetMGM operations as it anticipates revenue contributions of $1.8 -$2 billion in 2023.The forward P/E of MGM Resorts for the current financial year is 6.77X, lower than the industry average of 20.71X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.39, lower than the industry average of 2.12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. is likely to gain from expansions in the Permian Basin. The Sandbox and EP Minerals buyouts are also expected to make significant contributions. SLCA's focus on increasing its footprint and product offerings in specialty end markets is also likely to boost margins.The forward P/E of SLCA for the current financial year is 8.36X, lower than the industry average of 9.46X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.60, lower than the industry average of 2.17.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Krispy Kreme, Inc. DNUT, McCormick &amp; Company, Inc. MKC, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Consumer Staples Stocks to Buy on a Jump in Retail SalesU.S. retail sales rose in April as consumer spending continued to increase in the face of economic headwinds, including higher commodity prices. This comes as inflation has lately been showing signs of easing.However, economic uncertainties prevail, and markets remain volatile. Naturally, people are spending cautiously and primarily on necessities. Given this situation, it would be prudent to invest in consumer staple stocks.Retail Sales ReboundThe Commerce Department said on May 16 that retail sales grew 0.4% in April after an upwardly revised decline of 0.7% in March. Although the figures came in below analysts' expectations of a rise of 0.7%, the good sign is that the sector is trying to bounce back from its recent lows.Core retail sales, which exclude autos and gasoline, jumped a solid 0.6% in April. Seven of the 13 retail categories recorded growth in April. These included solid advances at general merchandise outlets, online merchants and auto dealers.People also spent more at restaurants. However, sales saw a decline at sporting goods, hobby stores, furniture retailers and appliances and electronics outlets.One of the major reasons behind the jump in sales is the low employment rate and steady growth in wages. Higher wages are helping consumers spend more freely. Solid job additions to the economy in April helped in the revival of the retail sector.Also, inflation has been showing signs of easing. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading for April showed that consumer prices increased 4.9% year over year compared to 5% recorded in March. This is also the lowest annual rate in two years.Story continuesMonth over month, CPI increased 0.4% in April compared to a rise of 0.1% in March.Separately, the Producer Price Index (PPI) reading showed wholesale prices growing 0.2% in April on a month-over-month basis, after declining 0.4% in March. However, it was lower than analysts' expectations of a rise of 0.3%.Core PPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.2%.Despite inflation showing signs of easing, it is still a lot higher than the Fed's target level of 2%. Moreover, consumers have been spending more lately, but the purchases are primarily basic necessities.The ideal thing to do in this situation would be to invest in defensive sector stocks, like consumer staples.The consumer staples sector is fundamentally sound and mature, given that consumer demand for staples typically remains resilient to fluctuations in the economic cycle. The consumer staples sector includes companies that essentially trade in daily necessities. The sector is therefore considered defensive in nature.Our PicksThe non-cyclical nature of consumer staples' businesses protects them from the market's vagaries. Additionally, these companies pay out dividends, indicating the strength of their businesses and capacity to weather market volatility.Krispy Kreme, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates as a branded retailer and wholesaler of doughnuts, coffee and other complementary beverages and treats and packaged sweets. DNUT's operating segments include Company Stores, Domestic Franchise, International Franchise and KK Supply Chain.Krispy Kreme's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17.2%.

That decision followed a weekend-long bidding war overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.“How do you explain approving a sale to a banking giant that increases the risk to the banking system by somewhere between nearly 800% and 1400% more than selling to other bidders?” Warren said.The percentages Warren cited were a reference to an institution's Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) score, which estimates the impact a bank would have on the US economy if it were to fail.According to these scores, Warren said, JPMorgan posed 8 times more risk than PNC (PNC) and 14 times more than Citizens Financial Group (CFG), which were also among the bidders for First Republic.Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she is ""very troubled"" by the First Republic sale to JPMorgan. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, she added, is required to consider concentration of power when assessing whether an acquisition might pose risks to stability of the US banking system.""According to your own metric you chose the one that gives us more concentration in the system,"" Warren said. ""I am very troubled by that decision.""Hsu said there were other factors regulators had to consider while evaluating bids for First Republic, which was previously the nation's 14th largest bank.The government had to act quickly to find a buyer over one critical weekend, and it had to minimize losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which is used to cover losses associated with bank failures. The seizure of First Republic is estimated to cost the FDIC $13 billion.Story continues“Had we followed a strict GSIB score methodology to the exclusion of everything else, I fear that there would have been greater financial instability that weekend,” Hsu said.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has forcefully rejected any concerns about the nation’s biggest bank getting even bigger as a result of this deal.""We need large successful banks in the largest and most prosperous economy in the world,"" he said the day the First Republic deal was announced. ""For anyone who thinks that the United States of America should not have that should call me directly.""JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has rejected suggestions that the First Republic deal concentrates too much power in his bank. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Warren raised her concentration concerns separately in a May 17 letter to Hsu and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg. In that letter she cited a $2.6 billion profit JPMorgan expects to book from the First Republic sale.""The net result of these machinations is that, without a complete regulatory review, and at a cost of $13 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the nation’s biggest bank – already too big to fail – got a bargain deal on a failing bank that made it even bigger,"" Warren said in her letter.""What additional regulatory requirements will be placed on JPMorgan to ensure that the bank’s acquisition of First Republic does not increase systemic risks to the financial system or reduce competition?""Gruenberg, who also appeared before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, offered a number of new details about the fall of First Republic in his prepared testimony.The lender first ran into troubled following the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank, losing more than $100 billion in deposits in March. When it told investors about those outflows on April 24, a run on the bank began again. It lost another $10 billion between April 26 and April 28, Gruenberg said.Michael J. Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, faced questions about the First Republic sale to JPMorgan. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The outflows caused the FDIC to downgrade the bank to ""problem status"" on April 28, he said, which changed the bank's borrowing status with the Federal Reserve and made it even more difficult to meet its liquidity demands.The FDIC invited 21 banks and 21 nonbanks to participate in a bidding process, according to Gruenberg. That included JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), and PNC, according to people familiar with the matter. Citizens and US Bancorp (USB) were also reportedly invited.It received 12 bids from four bidders, Gruenberg said. The FDIC requested best and final offers from the four bidders by 7 pm ET on April 30. The sale to JPMorgan was announced in the early hours of May 1.Trying to beat JPMorgan in a bidding war is like “pitching against the Yankees,"" one banking executive told Yahoo Finance this week.

More than 8 million children have been supported, particularly in underserved communities, since the initiative began 19 years ago.As part of this initiative, bilingual lesson plans have been created in collaboration with renowned arts and science organizations. They are free to educators, parents and caregivers and can be found in the PNC Grow Up Great Lesson Center.""Because we're bankers, not educators, from the start of PNC Grow Up Great we've worked with education experts at the local and national level, to develop resources and programs to support pre-K children, their families and their teachers,"" said Jeanine Fahnestock,"" senior vice president of PNC Bank and deputy executive director for PNC Grow Up Great. ""This latest alliance with PBS KIDS is another great example of leveraging the expertise of the best of the best.""Support for Today's TeachersThe PNC Grow Up Great Lesson Center provides field-tested lesson plans that educators can immediately integrate into their schedules. In addition to enriching classroom activities, the plans facilitate two-way communication within the home so parents can enhance their children's education and children can share the compelling topics they're learning about with their parents, particularly those around arts and science.Story continuesNow those plans are getting even better.Starting in 2021 and continuing through 2024, PNC has committed $750,000 in grants, teaming up with PBS KIDS to elevate selected lesson plans on PBS LearningMedia within its PNC Grow Up Great Lesson Center. More than 60 early childhood educators are actively involved in the continual development of 81 original lessons across seven PBS member stations. By Fall 2024, 118 lesson plans will be available from PBS KIDS on PBS LearningMedia.Based on teacher feedback, selected lessons are broken into ""bite-sized chunks."" All include brief videos of PBS KIDS characters such as Elinor from Elinor Wonders Why, Daniel Tiger from Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood and Buddy from Dinosaur Train, exploring content related to the learning themes. For example, the original Fall Lesson Collection in the PNC Grow Up Great Lesson Center comprised 10 lessons. The Fall Changing Seasons [2]collection on PBS LearningMedia includes 19 lesson plans.2These lesson plans focus on early science, math and art activities appropriate for each topic. They incorporate PBS KIDS video clips, games, extension activities, articles and crafts for classroom use along with resources to share with families.What Teachers Have to SayAfter her initial experience with the new plans, St. Louis, Missouri educator Molly Seiler (local PBS station Nine PBS, St. Louis, MO), reflected on the level of student engagement they encouraged. ""Before participating in a lesson titled ‘Changing Seasons, Rooting for Plants,' I was unsure what STEM integration in pre-K should look like,"" she said. ""Now that I have this experience, I want to try more lessons for this coming school year. These lessons were exciting not only for my students, but for me as well. We had fun investigating and learning together. There was lots of laughter and excitement, which is what lessons should have.""Chau Tran (local PBS station WUCF, Orlando, FL) remarked, ""I think this a great resource for those families and teachers that might not necessarily have the means they need to support children in their care. The program offers a plethora of accessible and free resources that more teachers need to know about.""Supporting Kids Who Can Change the WorldTawnya Heinsohn (local PBS station TPT, Elk River, MN) brings it home, ""As my students engaged with some of their favorite PBS KIDS friends, they were able to channel their curiosity, formulate and test hypotheses, and think of creative solutions about the world around them. Our learners may be young, but Elinor, Curious George and Sid the Science Kid encourage them to be world changers.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/755571/PNC-and-PBS-KIDS-Team-Up-To-Elevate-Pre-K-Lesson-Plans]"

To capitalize on the accelerated global shift to green cars, the auto giant is deepening focus on manufacturing electric and fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company's product competitiveness.Toyota Motor's commitment to return capital to shareholders and upbeat fiscal 2024 view spark confidence. However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Supply-chain disruptions and a tough labor market will play spoilsports.Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits.

Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market remains resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed’s 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. Despite a recessionary threat, a handful of consumer discretionary stocks look promising at this stage.The consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services, which are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.On the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector has flourished so far in 2023. This sector is generally recognized as a growth-oriented sector. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of market interest rate and are inversely related.The consumer discretionary sector suffered a big blow in 2022 as the Fed pursued an aggressive interest rate hike and tighter monetary control policy in order to control the 40-year high inflation. However, the magnitude of rate hike has reduced to quite an extent in 2023 as the inflation rate has declined steadily from its peak in June 2022.Moreover, in his May FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the interest rate hike cycle has perhaps reached its end. Consequently, a growth sector like consumer discretionary has regained its lost glory.Year to date, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) — one of the 11 broad-sector ETFs of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has rallied 16.5%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLas Vegas Sands Corp. LVS has been benefiting from a solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets, and attractive property locations. LVS is optimistic about Macao’s recovery on the back of resilient customer demand and spending.With the easing of restrictions coupled with a recovery in travel and tourism, LVS anticipates generating strong cash flows from the region in the days ahead. Also, management emphasized increasing investment in the Singapore market and boosting offerings throughout 2023.Zacks Rank #2 Las Vegas Sands has expected revenue and earnings growth rates of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 23% over the last 30 days.Skechers U.S.A. Inc. SKX has been benefiting from its enhanced digital capabilities. Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are also driving growth for SKX.In first-quarter 2023, revenues and earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year on higher direct-to-consumer and wholesale sales. International sales increased 21.1% year over year, accounting for 63% of the overall sales in the quarter. SKX is witnessing solid demand for its comfort technology products.Zacks Rank #1 Skechers U.S.A.  has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.5% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL has been benefiting from strong close-in bookings at higher prices and continued strength of onboard spending driving load factors. Considering the extension of the WAVE season and solid pent-up demand, RCL raised its 2023 guidance. RCL expects adjusted EPS to be $4.40-$4.80, up from the previously stated $3-$3.60.Zacks Rank #2 Royal Caribbean Cruises has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 47.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year.

(Operator Instructions) Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and fiscal 2023 Form 8-Ks on the file with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.Story continuesBarbara RentlerGood afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2023 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, despite continued inflationary pressures impacting our low to moderate income customers, first quarter sales were relatively in line with our expectations. Total sales of $4.5 billion, up from $4.3 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 1%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023, are $1.09 on net income of $371 million. These results compare to $0.97 per share on net earnings of $338 million for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022. Cosmetics and accessories were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter continued to trail Ross, reflecting the aforementioned inflationary pressures that continues to have a larger impact on our lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 16% versus last year. Average store inventories were up 2% at the end of the quarter. Packaway merchandise represented 42% of total inventories versus 43% last year.Turning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 100 new stores this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now, Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023.Adam M. OrvosThank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 1% for the quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. First quarter operating margin of 10.1% was down from 10.8% in 2022. As expected, this decline primarily reflects higher incentive compensation versus last year when we underperformed our expectations. Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs, while domestic freight costs declined by 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these 2 favorable items were higher distribution expenses of 65 basis points, driven primarily by unfavorable packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center. Buying increased by 60 basis points due to higher incentive compensation and occupancy deleveraged 5 basis points. SG&amp;A for the period rose 115 basis points, mainly due to higher incentive compensation and store wages versus last year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $234 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. For the 13 weeks ending July 29, 2023, comparable sales are forecast to be relatively flat. Second quarter 2023 earnings per share are projected to be $1.07 to $1.14 versus $1.11 for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022. Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2023 include the following: total sales are forecast to increase 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 27 locations in the second quarter, including 18 Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 9.8% to 10.1% range, down from 11.3% in 2022 as higher merchandise margin from lower ocean freight cost is forecast to be offset by an increase in expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages. We expect net interest income to be approximately $31 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 339 million. Now turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and guidance for the second quarter, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are still planned to be relatively flat. We now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, to be $4.77 to $4.99 compared to $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This guidance includes an estimated benefit to full year 2023 earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the 53rd week. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.Barbara RentlerThank you, Adam. As noted on our last earnings call, we had expected fiscal 2023 to be another challenging year. This was especially true given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environment. As a result of today's uncertain external landscape, especially the prolonged inflationary pressures negatively impacting our customers' discretionary spend, shoppers are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, we remain focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible while diligently managing expenses and inventory to maximize our opportunities for growth. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Barbara, maybe given the pressure on your low to middle income or low to moderate income customer base that you cited, how do you feel today about your merchandise assortments across categories from that value perspective? And then how are you managing buys in the marketplace just given the current level of disruption across the apparel landscape today?Barbara RentlerThe merchandise assortments from value perspective -- first, let me lead with, we weren't really satisfied with our results. So as I look across the different businesses, we had some businesses where the business didn't perform as well as we had expected, and we're addressing those issues. So let me start with that. As I look at value across the store, that has been a main focus for the merchants for the last few months. So I'd say that we've made progress across the board, but I still think that that is a major focus for us, offering the customer the best branded bargains possible at the best possible values we can put out there. So I would say we're on a journey, and everyone is -- really, the merchant team is highly focused on this. And I really think that that's an important part, especially for our mid- to lower-income customers. And then in terms of managing -- you're saying in terms of managing supply in the marketplace, is that how I interpret that question?Matthew Robert BossYes, just how you're managing buys given how much disruption there is in the overall apparel landscape? How much you're leaving, thinking about current open to buy and relative to maybe things opportunistic from a packaway perspective.Barbara RentlerOkay. Well, we have enough open to buy for both packaway and to chase the business. So right now, the plan is postured that we would chase the business as we're coming across and we're monitoring the speed of spending. And the hotel, same scenario. Hotel inventories are basically at the same rate as they were last year. And so the merchants are out in the market seeking out deals and based on those deals, we make those decisions. So if a deal comes in one business and that wasn't really even planned for that business, we might take that plan up. So we're really looking for with the overarching idea that what we want to do is get best possible values on the floor. So the merchants go to the market, and then there's discussions about what's out there. I know you know that there is pretty broad-based availability out there, maybe across most businesses anyway, in most brands in the market because as you know, supply fluctuates by type of product and vendor. But you have to kind of be out there and be in it to really see what's out there and then come back and then decide where do we want to take the deal. But that is our focus in both companies, delivering the best branded bargains that we possibly can.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerSo you're holding your comp guide for the year, though, you noted the consumer is looking for a deeper value and your merchants are focused on that. So I guess I'm wondering how the expected makeup of that flat comp has changed versus your expectations at the start of the year? And to the extent that there's perhaps some lower ticket involved, are there any margin implications we should be aware of?Michael J. HartshornMark, it's Michael Hartshorn. Let me start by just talking a little bit about the first quarter. The comp in the first quarter was driven by a number of transactions, and that was -- for us, that's our proxy for traffic. It was up versus a year ago. So that's a good sign on customer traffic returning. The average basket was flat and it was flat on units per transaction, up on a lower AUR. As far as how we're looking at the year, our outlook has not changed. We'll continue to manage the business with a conservative posture and be in a position to chase trends, chase the business and manage expense and inventory very conservatively. On a stack basis as we move through the quarter, and as weather became more favorable, we did see trends improve on a multiyear basis. So what that says to us is, obviously, healthy traffic and a trend that, in our mind, hasn't changed and hasn't changed our outlook for the year.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious about geographic dispersion, maybe if you could talk about some of your big states performance in those states, specifically California. How the trends look from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter? And if maybe you could talk about apparel versus home performance.Michael J. HartshornSure, Paul. On trends during the quarter, as I just mentioned, on a stack basis, we did see -- and stack basis versus pre-COVID, we did see trends improve as we moved through the quarter with April being the strongest. Geographically, we mentioned the Midwest with the top-performing region for our larger markets. Texas was above the chain average. Florida was in line and California underperformed the chain average given the difficult weather throughout the quarter in the West. Merchandise-wise, accessories and cosmetics were the best-performing businesses as we said in the script. Overall, shoes performed above the chain average, while home was in line and apparel trailed.Paul Lawrence LejuezMichael, can you just -- a little bit more on California. Any quantification of how much of it was below the chain? And did that gap close that between California and the rest of the chain by the end of the quarter?Michael J. HartshornIt did close, it was -- we wouldn't get into the specifics, but it did underperform the chain average and it improved as weather improved.OperatorAnd the next question is from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonAs you move through the quarter, did you see any signs of customers trading down into Ross or any other notable changes in consumer behavior?Michael J. HartshornI'd say overall, Lorraine, it was -- it's hard -- there's so many factors that go into sales. Obviously, the low-end customer continues to be pressured, whether it's ongoing inflation, reduction in SNAP benefits, lower tax refunds, but it was hard to see whether there's a trade down customer in that data.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonAnd the lower AUR in the quarter, was that all moving towards sharper price points? Or is there a mix component to that that we should factor in?Barbara RentlerThat's really off of a sharper price point. It wasn't generated by mix.OperatorAnd the next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.Charles P. GromThe merchandise margin had a nice uptick here in the first quarter relative to the last quarter. Can you talk about the drivers? I think you called out freight and then how you're thinking about that line item over the balance of the year?Adam M. OrvosYes. Chuck, this is Adam. So I mentioned the merchandise margin grew by 120 basis points in Q1. Ocean freight was clearly the most impactful component here driving the improvement. Our performance in merc margin was in line with what we embedded in our guidance for Q1. And assuming rates stay where they are, I expect that to continue as we move through the year.OperatorAnd the next question is from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantBarbara, I want to ask you about packaway, the 42% this year versus 43%. First and foremost, it sounds like you believe that your assortment is on trend, and then typically, when there are these kind of late weather breaks to kind of warmer weather across retail, it gives you the opportunity to chase into sort of known winters. Do you feel better about the assortment heading into the second quarter? And then, Adam, or Barbara, with frontline still being very promotional, does that somehow impede the ability to drive maybe higher AURs because the value is not as evident as it may be when frontline is a little bit less promotional?Barbara RentlerOkay, Adrienne. So let's start with packaway, I think the first question was about packaway, the content at packaway? So the content at packaway, we feel good about that content at packaway. Last year at this particular moment in time was when we started to bring in goods because of all the carrier issues that went on with whenever things speeded up, we took good and put them into packaway as we told all of you that we use later on in the year, really our direct imports. So the packaway that we have in there now is really closed out great deals that we feel very good about. So the percent might be the same, but the content is different. So that's the first one. The second one, in terms of the late weather break, I'm not sure I 100% understand what you mean by that.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantSo oftentimes when it's been cold in the Northeast and many people were sort of -- retailers were sort of missing plan for -- just because it was colder than for longer. And in the past, it seems like those types of poor weather transitions have given you the opportunity, but I think you just answered it in your first one.Barbara RentlerYes. Yes, you're saying were there additional great deals out there because weather is good. That's kind of ongoing. And the merchants, yes, are in the market, looking close out facing the business and all of that. So that's very different by type of business. Yes, there are -- so that's part of the supply availability that's out there.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantAnd the spread, the kind of wide the spread from frontline to your pricing?Barbara RentlerI think you're just saying that they are promoting now, it's more promotional than it's been and then what's our relationship to the promotional environment?Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantYes. Does it make it harder to create that value notion when the frontline retailers are sort of every day sitting on the 50 half.Barbara RentlerYes. Listen, look, I think the promotional environment is still very -- is still competitive. It's still a competitive market. We watch people get more promotional in the last few months. I don't think that that's going away. I think what has to happen is and what is happening is that the buyers have to be in the market, constantly working with vendors to understand 2 things. One, not only just brand availability, but also pricing because they need -- they know that they need to get -- they need to have their values be sharper. So they're competitive shopping, seeing what's going on in stores and then they're in the market and vendors are giving them the lay of the land, availability, I have -- what you're talking about the excess goods close out and also kind of where the pricing is, they're keeping that in mind because they're studying that. So for a while, the world's got very different and there was much more regular price selling, particularly in department stores. We're watching as you're watching that erode and it's becoming more promotional. So those have been best practices for the company for years. And so that's what the merchants are doing to ensure that if they're watching it and then making some assumptions about what they believe could happen in front of them, which would be -- but traditionally done enough price prior to all of the things that have gone on since COVID has started and more regular price selling and all of that.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.Kate Bridget FitzsimonsThis is Kate on for Ike. I guess just to hone in on the gross margin piece, you guys had a decent amount of volatility in both distribution and buying buckets last year within COGS. Can you walk us through how you think those line items progress through the rest of the year, maybe direction or magnitude?Adam M. OrvosYes. Kate, this is Adam. So we'll take them individually. So ocean freight costs, a significant tailwind in Q1. Again, given all the volatility we've seen over time, don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but kind of what's embedded in the guidance is we'll continue to see that as a tailwind as we go through the balance of the year. Domestic freight, we called out the 60 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Again, highly dependent here on fuel prices. And obviously, there's wage increases embedded in those costs. But assuming those things stay stable, would continue to expect that to be a tailwind for us as we go forward. The biggest piece that we've called out for some time, offsetting those benefits are incentive costs. So we gave you the details of that approximately in the call comments, I would also say in the second quarter, when we look at it, will probably be the most impactful quarter for us from an incentive cost increase this year versus last year. We also commented on distribution expenses. So again, driven by timing of packaway and then the planned deleverage from our newer distribution center in Houston.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonGreat. So it feels like this is kind of an ongoing narrative for the last year that you're not super happy with the value you're offering the customer. Though historically, I think you've proven super consistent and successful there. So I'm just wondering, has anything changed in the buying organization? Or what do you think the buying team is getting wrong now? And maybe how you're thinking about correcting this or putting initiatives in place to perhaps get this back on track?Barbara RentlerLook, I think the value equation we've been working on for the last few months -- over the last year, moving towards getting to that value point, I think we're kind of at a different place now than where we were a few months ago, both in brands and in values on the floor. So I don't see it kind of the merchants aren't doing their job. I kind of see it as an evolution. And so we are very, very highly focused now on delivering compelling value as we watch our customers in both companies struggle with all the inflation and all the things that are going on around them, we've gotten pretty beary. Let me put this way, we're very highly focused on delivering those values. So where we were, let's say, 6 months ago and how we're thinking about it now, continues to evolve. And so we want to make sure that we have a really wide assortment, fresh receipts, branded merchandise and where it's appropriate that we're sharpening our branded values to strengthen the offerings because of the competitive retail environment. So I don't feel like it's not necessarily working, I feel like it's evolving, and I think our business last year evolved as we went along, and it's important for us to make sure that we deliver really sharp value to our customers, particularly in this time frame. And now that the world is getting even more competitive and more promotional, we have to look through that lens also. So I think that we need to stay focused on it and do a better job on this and making sure that we really understand where it's appropriate that we are sharpening out our branded values. And so I don't think it's not working. I think it's much more of an evolution in all of our businesses.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets.Simeon Avram SiegelAny change in the percent of sales being driven by top vendors versus last year and then just versus a historical trend. Just wondering if concentration of the largest vendors has changed at all? And then just because it's coming up fairly frequently, any updated thoughts on shrink.Michael J. HartshornI'll start. It's Michael, Simeon. On shrink, we -- the shrink was a little bit higher for us last year, wasn't meaningfully higher. We've assumed that it will stay at or slightly above those levels in our estimates, but no updates -- we typically update the financial impact of that when we take true up our physical inventory in the third quarter.Barbara RentlerAnd the percentage of our top vendors versus historical, I mean, that moves based up of supply, right? So one year, we could have a great deal of merchandise from one vendor, top vendor and then the next year, a little bit less, but a little bit more from someone else. So I think that it kind of moves around. I don't think it's changed that much. I don't know if we're defining as top vendors, but it hasn't changed that much. It changes more by the vendor itself and the availability that's out there.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about the performance of dd's and what's happening in the environment, was there any differential in dd's performance in the fourth quarter to the first quarter and what you saw? And then just lastly, on the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations that are available, if you were to get any, would that be in addition to the current run rate of store openings this year? Or would it be part of it?Michael J. HartshornDana, on dd's, the sales trends continue to trail Ross' results during the first quarter. I wouldn't comment on the differential between fourth and first. Obviously, their customer faces even more macro headwinds relative to Ross', which is, I think, reflected in their underperformance. I would also say, though, similar to Ross, we are sharply focused on offering better values to help drive improved sales performance there. On Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, it will no doubt provide opportunities for new store locations. We'll have to review each potential new site on a case-by-case basis to see if it's appropriate for us. But I would say, it's not going to impact our 100 store opening plan for this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulI guess just a question for me is as you think about what's happening in the macro, when you look at your good, better, best mix, are you migrating your offering to the lower end of the spectrum? I'm just curious just in terms of the buys or how you're thinking about the merchandising piece of it.Barbara RentlerSure. So we have a good, better, best strategy, and that is really driven by the assortment that we put on the floor and the values we put out there. So we want a tiered strategy because we're going to track much more broader set of customers. But that can move based on supply, based on availability, based on our purchases. So it fluctuates as you go.Robert Scott DrbulAnd your -- as you think about the rest of the year, you're not really buying for sort of more of a good environment versus a better versus best in your offering?Barbara RentlerI think that depends by business. I think that I can't tell you that that is a company-wide strategy. I think that moves by business based on what the business is. And clearly, the dd's customer, in particular, is very price-sensitive, so really paying attention to the values we're putting on the floor or the pricing we're putting on the floor, both. So -- but even at dd's, these things, it moves around. So we are obviously conscious there, particularly with that customer.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachGiven the ongoing inflationary pressures in the macro, I'm wondering if you can provide updated thoughts on the longer-term path to recapturing pre-COVID operating margins? Are there any initiatives that you're contemplating to help drive that recovery outside of sharpening values and driving additional market share capture?Adam M. OrvosBrooke, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. So our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but -- over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We're seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we're still -- these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we're seeing some wage pressures in the stores. When you talk about -- we've guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers. So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we've touched on in the past.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital.Laura Allyson ChampineIt's about the weather's impact on your comp in Q1. Is that something you can quantify or maybe if that's a tough one, maybe give us the discrepancy roughly between California and the rest of the chain?Michael J. HartshornLaura, it's hard to calculate. I mean, I think it -- suffice it to say, it didn't help our business. I would say California was slightly under the -- trailed the chain average and did improve as weather improved is what we'd say.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.Marni ShapiroI just wanted to clarify. I think you said the 53rd week adds about $0.15. Could we expect between like $350 million to $400 million in sales? Is that a decent number to use for that week? Or is it a little less because it's a January week? Just curious.Adam M. OrvosProbably a little bit less than that, Marni, given that it's, as you said, given that it's January, early February.Marni ShapiroThat's what I figured. And then this came up on other calls, it looks like your traffic is good that people are looking for sharper deals, but you obviously called out accessories and cosmetics beauty, which tends to have a lower AUR. Are people gravitating towards the lower-priced items? Or as you've seen the weather improve, have you seen apparel come back in slightly higher AUR, but they're looking for the apparel items that are on sale or just at the better prices. I'm curious sort of what the dynamic is there.Barbara RentlerSo apparel struggled in Q1. So I don't necessarily think it was driven off the prices. I think that the assortments were not necessarily where we wanted them to be. So depending upon what this discussion, that could have been the price, that could have been the product because there's a variety of factors in there. So I don't think I could take it down to a common denominator price or say, was it driven by markdowns or was it driven -- it really -- I would say, it was driven by the assortment when it's all said and done. Certainly, the weather didn't help, but I don't think the weather is a big enough impact, so I could sit here and say that. I think our assortments weren't necessarily where we wanted them to be. And so we're working on that, and we're going to continue to work on that. But it's not really based off of a price or one thing or -- we have our work cut out for us and the merchants are working on that now.Michael J. HartshornIt wasn't driven by mix. It was driven -- being sharper priced across the assortment.Marni ShapiroSo it was across -- you saw the softness across the assortment in apparel. It wasn't specific -- AUR?Michael J. HartshornYou asked that was AUR driven by mix in the business. It was not driven by mix.Marni ShapiroBut on the apparel side, was the softness across the board, whether it was men's Polo shirts or women's dresses or kids, every department across the board was soft? Or were there certain spots even without disclosing if you don't want to, were there certain spots that were -- that really need a lot of work and other spots that were okay.Barbara RentlerWell, obviously, we're not going to get into details, but within all the apparel businesses, like common sense to tell you that some businesses are better than others, right? So with that, we wouldn't get into specifics, but there's no -- you're asking is there like you're (inaudible). In one particular area? I don't know. I know what you're referring (inaudible) there.Marni ShapiroI was kind of thinking on the positive. Was there something that you're saying -- dress were killer.Barbara RentlerCouldn't decide where you were going with that. Every business has businesses that were performing, some businesses didn't and so we're not going to get into specifics on that. What I would say is that the merchants are very diligently working on the assortments, whether it's delivering the right products, whether it's the values, I mean they're really highly focused on that right now.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.Corey TarloweBarbara, just on the availability across your good, better, best spectrum that you have. Is there any better availability within any one of those 3 segments as you speak to your merchants?Barbara RentlerYou're just saying where does the supply -- the supply is pretty broad-based. I mean supply in most businesses, there's always more one vendor than the other, more on product than the other. I mean, it fluctuates overall, there's still a lot of supply. I wouldn't say it's bucketed in one of those 3 buckets. No, I would still say it's pretty broad-based.Corey TarloweGot it. And then just on the lower AUR common being driven by sharper price points. I guess within the context of the guide for the full year for flat comps, is the expectation that the AUR is likely to be lower throughout the rest of the year as well?Barbara RentlerThe -- putting out better value doesn't necessarily mean that your AUR is going down. But what we're focused on is we're focused on delivering really sharp value. So depending upon what -- you're -- using your example of the good, better, best depending upon what that mix looks like, that doesn't necessarily mean the AUR is going down. What we're really trying to do is we're really trying to focus on sharpening our branded values for the customer. And so we think that's our path to driving sales, and we think that's our path ultimately to gaining market share. So those 2 don't necessarily go hand in hand.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleIt looks like you beat the low end of your -- the guidance that you gave for EPS in the first quarter by about $0.10, but you're raising the low end of the full year guidance by about $0.12. Can you just tell us what the extra $0.02 is, where that's coming from?Michael J. HartshornYes. I think the better way to look at it is what we did on the top end. We beat the top end by 4, you lose a quarter in that, and then we raised the full year by the $0.04.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.Aneesha ShermanSo your guidance implies -- your 2-year stack comp for this quarter was minus 6%, and your guidance implies a deceleration of that stack to about minus 7% for Q2 and then a pickup in the back half to get kind of closer to 0 to your stack. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the progression through the year? And why are you more cautious about Q2 and then a little bit more optimistic for the back half of the year?Michael J. HartshornSure, Aneesha. I think it's hard to look at these on a 2-year stack with all the fiscal stimulus and COVID. So we're really looking at it, pre-COVID, what's changed on a 4-year stack and how that's progressed over time. And we went into the year and had a plan in the first quarter. What we saw is that 4-year stack improved as we move through the quarter and weather improved and exited in a place that would support that stack guidance for the year.Aneesha ShermanOkay. So just to clarify, you are embedding an improvement in the 4-year stack through the course of the year?Michael J. HartshornCorrect, yes.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Krista Zuber with TD Cowen.Krista Kerr ZuberIt's Krista on for John. Just a quick question. On inventory, you've had several -- at least 2 quarters here of a fairly sizable declines. Just wondering how you're thinking about it through the balance of this year. And should we continue to expect declines on a quarterly basis through the end of the year? Or do you think at some point, you sort of pull in line with your sales growth expectations.Michael J. HartshornSure. It's -- if you look at the first quarter, for instance, we were down 16%, but we were up against elevated inventories last year when supply chain lead times eased, and we had a surplus of early receipts. So what you'd expect as we move through the year with the -- with that elevated inventory last year, it started to recede, in the third and fourth quarter and you get more comparable, but we should be lower given the excess inventory we had last year in the first half of the year.OperatorAnd at this time, I'm seeing no further questions. I'd like to pass it back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments.Barbara RentlerThanks for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.OperatorThank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

Prolonged economic data demonstrating resilience in some areas and measured declines in others are giving oxygen to the “soft landing” narrative. The Dow was up +115 points on the day, +0.34%, the S&amp;P 500 was +0.94%, the Nasdaq — now up more than +22% year to date — gained another +188 points, +1.51%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 reached +0.58%.Earlier today, we saw Existing Homes Sales figures for April, which were slightly above expectations to 4.28 million seasonally adjusted annualized units, but, as expected, beneath the 4.43 million reported for the previous month. You can put this in the “measured declines” column. And Leading Economic Indicators, also for April, halved the previous month’s headline but still came in negative, at an as-expected -0.6%.Applied Materials AMAT posted beats on both top and bottom lines for its fiscal Q2 results reported after the close, with earnings of $2.00 per share outperforming the $1.84 expected (and $1.85 per share from a year ago) on sales of $6.63 billion, which easily surpassed the $6.40 billion in the Zacks consensus. Resilience in mature nodes and foundry businesses gained in the quarter, as did its Memory category, which other chipmakers found challenging in the quarter.Ross Stores ROST also beat expectations on its bottom line in its Q1 report out this afternoon, by 3 cents per share to $1.09, and nicely above the 97 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter. Revenues in the quarter were flat with expectations to $4.49 billion, +3.73% year over year. Comps were +1%, but guidance for the current quarter is flat. The company cited prolonged inflation pressures, among other things.We’re through with big economic data reports for the week, with Deere &amp; Co. DE and Foot Locker FL putting up quarterly numbers before tomorrow’s open. Next week is light on data — PMI Manufacturing and Services, plus a big PCE support a week from tomorrow — but still heavy on Q1 earnings, albeit mostly of the smaller-cap type. Let’s see if these recent market gains are sustainable with a relative dearth of new market information.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

187,4811879e-be6a-3189-ba3c-e8a5b376be17,ADI,2023-05-19,Is Analog Devices (ADI) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-adi-buy-wall-133001821.html,1684416601,STORY,['ADI'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Analog Devices (ADI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Analog Devices currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.58, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.58 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.4% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ADIBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ADICheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Analog Devices here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Analog Devices, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in ADI?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Analog Devices, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $10.60.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Analog Devices. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Analog Devices.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market remains resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed’s 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. Despite a recessionary threat, a handful of consumer discretionary stocks look promising at this stage.The consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services, which are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.On the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector has flourished so far in 2023. This sector is generally recognized as a growth-oriented sector. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of market interest rate and are inversely related.The consumer discretionary sector suffered a big blow in 2022 as the Fed pursued an aggressive interest rate hike and tighter monetary control policy in order to control the 40-year high inflation. However, the magnitude of rate hike has reduced to quite an extent in 2023 as the inflation rate has declined steadily from its peak in June 2022.Moreover, in his May FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the interest rate hike cycle has perhaps reached its end. Consequently, a growth sector like consumer discretionary has regained its lost glory.Year to date, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) — one of the 11 broad-sector ETFs of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has rallied 16.5%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

193,0bbcbe00-6d4e-3366-9c4e-86753622d70c,MAR,2023-05-19,Marriott and KLX Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-klx-energy-highlighted-zacks-112911703.html,1684409351,STORY,"['MAR', '^GSPC', 'KLXE']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 18, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Marriott MAR as the Bull of the Day and KLX Energy KLXE as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Vista Energy, S.A.B. de C.V. VIST and Xerox Holdings Corporation XRX.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:Little by little, the world eventually crawled out of the COVID cave and into a new era. Those industries hardest hit by the shutdowns started to come back en vogue. It's led to huge rallies in travel-related stocks like today's Bull of the Day. These companies spent the year getting leaner and meaner, allowing them to really ring the register when the business came back to normal levels.Today's Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Marriott. Marriott International, Inc. operates, franchises, and licenses hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties worldwide. The company operates through U.S. and Canada, and international segments. It operates properties under 30 brand names in 138 countries and territories.Marriott enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the recent jump in earnings estimates for the current year and next year. Over the last thirty days alone, ten analysts have increased their numbers for the current year while eight have followed suit for next year. The bullish moves have pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $7.70 to $8.33 while next year's number is up from $8.47 to $8.98.This came on the heels of yet another earnings surprise. Last quarter's report came in 23 cents or 12.37% better than expectations at $2.09 per share. That was the third quarterly beat in the last year, beating by an average of 8.03%. These surprises as well as the recent upwards earnings estimate revisions are helping to underpin the rally in the stock.Bear of the Day:Oil stocks enjoyed a wonderful run last year. With most industries coming under pressure, oil was one of the few areas where you could make money. The good times and the bad times never last forever. In this case, the energy sector has been the worst performing sector over the course of the last 30 days. The sector is down over 7% over that period of time.Story continuesToday's Bear of the Day is a stock within that sector. I'm talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) KLX Energy. KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc. provides drilling, completions, production, and well intervention services and products to the onshore oil and gas producing regions of the United States. The company operates through three segments: Southwest, Rocky Mountains, and Northeast/Mid-Con. It provides directional drilling services; and downhole navigational and rental tools businesses and support services, including well planning, site supervision, accommodation rentals, and other drilling rentals.The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is that analysts have been cutting their estimates for the current year and next year. The bearish moves have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $5.19 to $3.22 while next year's number is off from $6.37 to $3.25.KLXE is in the Oil and Gas -Field Services industry which ranks in the Bottom 19% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:How to Find Undervalued StocksThe fundamental assumption of value stock investing is that the market is rational. Therefore, stocks that trade below what they're worth will at any given time, will in the future reflect their intrinsic value.Therefore, if we're looking for value stocks, we must first find stocks that do not reflect their market values. This could be on the basis of one or more valuation metrics, such as P/E, P/S, P/B, PEG, etc. The idea is to then compare the stock's valuation multiple with its industry and a benchmark index, such as the S&amp;P 500. Its trading range over a certain period of time, usually a year, should also be ascertained to compare the current valuation with the historical average. If the stock has a lower multiple than in recent history or its multiple represents a significant discount from the industry or index, it would appear to be undervalued.But that's not the end of the story. We need to then find out whether the low valuation is justified. If for example, the valuation is below the historical average for reasons such as broader market movements; negative news flow that doesn't directly affect the company's business or at least, not to a significant extent; periods of cyclical slowdown that don't in any way affect the longer-term potential of the stock; or missed estimates in any given quarter leaving the long-term thesis intact, this should be viewed as an opportunity to buy.However, if the low valuation is for example, because of uncertainty related to its future product pipeline/prospects, if there's a lack of futuristic thinking, if it does have a good competitive moat, if management is inexperienced, or if it is wasting too much money because of operational inefficiencies, the valuation could be justified. In such a situation, if we buy the shares simply because they are cheap, we would have walked into a value trap.Therefore, it always makes sense to study the stocks we're intending to buy and understand properly what we're getting ourselves into. Here at Zacks, we can also consider the Zacks stock ranking system, which is an indication of a stock's future performance. A Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) rated stock always has a better chance of appreciation than stocks rated #3 (Hold), #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell). Additionally, if they also belong to the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries, they tend to do all the better. Here are a couple of stocks that have attractive ratings, belong to attractive industries  and also have strong fundamentals:Vista Energy, S.A.B. de C.V.Mexico City-based Vista Energy is involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas in Latin America. The company's principal assets are located in the Vaca Muerta shale formation in the Neuquén Basin of Argentina. It also has drilling and workover activities in Argentina and owns other producing assets in Mexico. This makes it Argentina's third largest oil producer and second largest shale oil operator.According to company sources, the Vaca Muerta is the fourth largest shale oil reserve in the world and the second largest gas reserve. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that it has ""technically recoverable resources of 308 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 16 billion barrels of oil and condensate within 8.6 million acres, and it is geologically comparable to the Eagle Ford shale play in southern Texas"". What's more, ""only 4% of Vaca Muerta's acreage has entered the development phase so far.""The company's production efforts are primarily concentrated on shale oil, with 29,661 barrels per day produced in the Bajada del Palo Oeste block within the Vaca Muerta formation. Being in the southern hemisphere, Vista is able to supply Asian markets when they need it most.In the first quarter, sales were up 45.7% year over year and generated earnings growth of 718.8%. Sales and earnings beat estimates by 2.2% and 32.3%, respectively.In the last quarter, the company's production increased 29% from the prior year. Management said that Vista Oil completed drilling pads 12 and 13 and has plans to plug 24 new wells in the second quarter, as indicated in their 2022 guidance.Analysts expect this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock to generate revenue growth of 13.1% and earnings growth of 48.8% in 2023. This will be followed by 18.8% revenue growth and 25.0% earnings growth next year. Its 2023 estimate has not moved much of late but the 2024 estimate is up 12.4% in the last 60 days.Vista shares are surprisingly undervalued. At 4.21X earnings, they're trading at a 77.1% discount to the S&amp;P 500 and 47.4% discount to the industry. Therefore, they're worth snapping up right away.Xerox Holdings CorporationNorwalk, CT-based Xerox has evolved from a traditional printer manufacturer to a comprehensive provider of business services and technologies. Therefore, in addition to workplace solutions like printers and digital presses and paper products, today it also offers a range of digital IT services leveraging automation and communication software through licenses and standalone software. It also provides related financing.At the company's earnings announcement, management talked about Xerox's strong performance, resilient demand, profitability initiatives and strategic priorities.Xerox beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 206.3%. The huge surprise was despite the fact that revenue beat by less than a percentage point. Revenue increased 2.8% from the prior year while earnings increased 508.3%.Management said that its service offerings were instrumental in supporting revenue, as they help clients navigate challenging macroeconomic headwinds including higher inflation, labor shortages and tighter liquidity conditions. There is also some opportunity to address the productivity challenges of today's hybrid workplace. As a result, demand for Xerox equipment and services is proving to be relatively resilient.Management has adopted a more flexible cost structure and undertaken operational efficiencies, and both factors contributed to improvements in profitability during the quarter.The company also pays a very good dividend that currently yields 6.93%.Overall, management outlined three strategic priorities for 2023: client success, profitability enhancement (through cost-cutting initiatives) and shareholder returns. Xerox appears to be delivering on each.Xerox shares carry a Zacks Rank #1. While analysts expect low single-digit revenue declines in both 2023 and 2024, earnings are expected to jump 37.5% and 13.9% in the two years, respectively. Despite modest adjustment to estimates in the last seven days, the 2023 estimate is still up 29.4% from 30 days ago while the 2024 estimate is up 11.5%.Xerox shares are trading at 8.72X earnings, which is a 38.7% discount to the industry and 52.6% discount to the S&amp;P 500. Given their growth outlook, these shares are definitely worth buying.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Those industries hardest hit by the shutdowns started to come back en vogue. It’s led to huge rallies in travel-related stocks like today’s Bull of the Day. These companies spent the year getting leaner and meaner, allowing them to really ring the register when the business came back to normal levels.Today’s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Marriott (MAR). Marriott International, Inc. operates, franchises, and licenses hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties worldwide. The company operates through U.S. and Canada, and international segments. It operates properties under 30 brand names in 138 countries and territories.Marriott enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the recent jump in earnings estimates for the current year and next year. Over the last thirty days alone, ten analysts have increased their numbers for the current year while eight have followed suit for next year. The bullish moves have pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $7.70 to $8.33 while next year’s number is up from $8.47 to $8.98.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis came on the heels of yet another earnings surprise. Last quarter’s report came in 23 cents or 12.37% better than expectations at $2.09 per share. That was the third quarterly beat in the last year, beating by an average of 8.03%.

(NYSE:CMI) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CumminsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior Vice President, Livingston Satterthwaite, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$230 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$216. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Cummins didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Cummins insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$138m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Cummins Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Cummins, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Cummins. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Cummins.But note: Cummins may not be the best stock to buy.

This deal is expected to create one of the largest oil and natural gas pipeline companies in the United States.The agreement represents a current implied value of $67.50 per unit to each Magellan unitholder, for a 22% premium, based on the May 12, 2023, closing prices. ONEOK's acquisition of MMP marks a significant development in the energy infrastructure industry.The two premier companies have joined forces to create a combined company with a net enterprise value of $60.0 billion. This new midstream giant will have a diversified portfolio of assets across North America and provide services to customers in the energy industry.Combined Company to Offer a Wide Range of Services The acquisition of Magellan by ONEOK is likely to have a positive impact on the prospects of both companies. MMP has a strong portfolio of assets, including crude oil and refined product pipelines, marine terminals and storage facilities. The company also has a diverse customer base, which includes major oil and gas producers, refiners and marketers.The buyout will also give OKE access to Magellan's assets and customer base, allowing it to expand operations and create new revenue streams. It is also expected to result in significant cost savings and synergies, thereby improving the combined company’s profitability.Magellan will continue to operate as a separate entity within the ONEOK organization, retaining its brand and management team. The company's assets and operations will be integrated with the latter’s existing business. This will enable the combined company to provide a wide range of services to its customers.The acquisition will help diversify Magellan's product mix and boost the company’s earnings. This diversification will be achieved through the addition of stable, fee-based natural gas and NGL-focused businesses, thereby reducing dependence on a single product or market.Story continuesFurthermore, MMP unitholders will receive an upfront premium as a result of the acquisition, including a significant cash component. This immediate financial gain will provide a favorable return on investment for the unitholders.In addition to the cash component, the acquisition will also include an equity component. This will allow the unitholders to participate in the future growth, scale and earnings diversity of the combined entity. By joining forces with ONEOK, Magellan can tap into a larger market and leverage the potential of greater profitability.OKE's membership in the S&amp;P 500 Index will prove beneficial for MMP unitholders as it will expand investor access and improve unitholder liquidity. This, in turn, will facilitate easier trading and attract more investors to the combined entity.The acquisition will also provide an opportunity for Magellan's unitholders to take part in ONEOK's strong growth project backlog. This means that they can benefit from OKE’s future projects and initiatives, further boosting their investment potential and returns.The unitholders are also expected to receive tax deferral benefits from this acquisition. They can potentially reduce their tax burden and improve their financial position.Strategic Rationale for the AcquisitionONEOK is a leading midstream service provider in the United States, primarily focused on natural gas gathering, processing, and transportation. The company operates a network of pipelines, processing plants, and storage facilities in the mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions.OKE’s buyout of MMP is expected to generate significant cost savings and synergies. ONEOK expects to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $200 million by 2025. The company plans to do so through optimization of assets, streamlining of operations and elimination of redundant positions.ConclusionThe abovementioned acquisition marks an exciting chapter in the growth and development of ONEOK and Magellan. It also signals the companies’ commitment toward driving innovation and adding value to the energy industry.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, both Magellan and ONEOK carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are Evolution Petroleum EPM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Archrock AROC, holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

OKE and Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. MMP announced that they have signed a formal merger agreement. Per the contract, ONEOK will buy all of Magellan's outstanding units for $18.8 billion in cash and stock.Each outstanding MMP common unit will receive $25 in cash and 0.6670 shares of ONEOK as payment for the consideration. This represents a current implied value of $67.50 per unit to each Magellan unitholder for a 22% premium, based on May 12, 2023, closing prices.Benefits of the MergerThis agreement will open up Magellan's primarily fee-based refined products and crude oil transportation business to ONEOK. The infrastructure company is expected to generate stable cash flows through diverse commodity cycles.The combined company will have 44% of its business in natural gas liquids, and 21% in refined products. It will own more than 25,000 miles of liquid-oriented pipelines, with significant assets and operational expertise at the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent market hubs.The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. For the cash portion, ONEOK acquired fully committed bridge financing of $5.25 billion.In the first four years following the anticipated transaction closure, the combined company is expected to generate an average annual amount of $1 billion. This represents a significant improvement in the free cash flow after dividends and growth capital.Oil &amp; Gas Sector’s ConsolidationThe oil and gas sector has experienced significant consolidation over the years, with many large companies acquiring smaller competitors. This trend is expected to continue as companies look to streamline operations and reduce costs.Other companies like Chevron Corporation CVX and Liberty Energy LBRT are also expanding their operations through mergers and acquisitions.In 2020, Chevron acquired Noble Energy for $5 billion. The addition of the latter’s assets expanded CVX’s presence in the DJ Basin of Colorado and the Permian Basin across West Texas and New Mexico.In 2022, CVX acquired Renewable Energy Group (“REG”), under outstanding shares of REG in an all-cash transaction, valued at $3.15 billion or $61.50 per share. The acquisition combined the latter’s growing renewable fuels production and leading feedstock capabilities with Chevron’s large manufacturing, distribution and commercial marketing position.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVX's 2023 earnings is pegged at $14.30 per share. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 7.7% in the last four quarters.In April 2023, Liberty Energy announced the purchase of Siren Energy — an integrated natural gas compression and CNG transportation company with a Permian focus. The latter offered transportation, logistics and pressure-reduction services in addition to two expandable Permian sites with a 16-MMcf-per-day capability for natural gas compression. Subject to customary closing adjustments, Liberty Energy paid an overall cash price of $78 million to acquire Siren.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LBRT's 2023 earnings is pinned at $3.53 per share, indicating a 67.3% year-over-year rise. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 64.34% in the last four quarters.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the last six months, ONEOK’s shares have lost 12.2% compared with the sector’s 12.9% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks RankONEOK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Seventy percent of Million Dollar Baby's demand is on the U.S. East Coast, executives said.Large and small retailers have been diverting cargo away from West Coast ports since before the contract covering 22,000 dockworkers at ports stretching from California to Washington State expired on July 1, to avoid any repeat of labor disputes that in the past have stranded goods on docks or ships.During the first three months of 2023, West Coast ports handled 40% of U.S. container import volume. They handled 45% of cargo during the same period in 2019, before the pandemic struck, according to data from Descartes Datamyne.Extrapolating that first-quarter data over 12 months would show that more than 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) moved away from the West Coast ports annually, starting in 2021, said Chris Jones, an executive vice president at Descartes Systems Group.Story continuesColgate-Palmolive routed 25% of containers away from West Coast ports and has already begun reversing some of that, said Francisco Rodriguez, Colgate toothpaste maker's director of global logistics.The labor negotiation process, while lengthy, ""is working like it is supposed to,"" said Rodriguez, who added that his team monitors port activity daily and makes decisions based on that - rather than headlines about union negotiation-related conflict. Kevin Austin, group vice president of demand and supply management at Toyota Motor North America, declined to comment on the automaker's cargo volume trends at Los Angeles' port complex, but said the facility remains ""critical"" to the business.The port also faces new pressure from outside the United States, importers said.About six months ago, Million Dollar Baby started sending some upholstered furniture with price tags of under $800 per piece from China into the port at Ensenada, Mexico.Importing to Mexico opens a legal loophole that enables Million Dollar Baby to sell those products to U.S. customers without a 25% tariff. Warehouse and labor costs are also lower in Mexico than in the United States, adding to savings, Diaz said. (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this cable provider have returned +5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Cable Television industry, which Comcast falls in, has gained 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Comcast is expected to post earnings of $1 per share, indicating a change of -1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. This estimate has changed +2.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.12 indicates a change of +9.7% from what Comcast is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Comcast is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMCSA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Comcast, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $120.67 billion and $123.52 billion estimates indicate -0.6% and +2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryComcast reported revenues of $29.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +15%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Comcast is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Comcast. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.1%, which is below the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for P10 P10's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. The last dividend was quite easily covered by P10's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 19%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendP10 Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryIt is tough to make a judgement on how stable a dividend is when the company hasn't been paying one for very long. This doesn't mean that the company can't pay a good dividend, but just that we want to wait until it can prove itself.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. P10 has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 25% per annum. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that P10 could prove to be a strong dividend payer.P10 Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for P10 that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

(MU) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-micron-technology-130001164.html,1684414801,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post a loss of $1.57 per share, indicating a change of -160.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of -$4.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -156.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$0.03 indicates a change of +99.4% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -57.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.45 billion and $21.09 billion estimates indicate -49.8% and +36.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $3.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -52.6%. EPS of -$1.91 for the same period compares with $2.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.24%. The EPS surprise was -189.39%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Long term Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) shareholders know that all too well, since the share price is down considerably over three years. Regrettably, they have had to cope with a 58% drop in the share price over that period. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 42% lower in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 17% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.While the stock has risen 5.0% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the three years that the share price declined, Fidelity National Information Services' earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Fidelity National Information Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Fidelity National Information Services' TSR for the last 3 years was -55%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveFidelity National Information Services shareholders are down 40% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.9%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 7% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Fidelity National Information Services is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Fidelity National Information Services is not the only stock insiders are buying.

Published in support of Aon's ongoing commitment to help Canadian clients make better decisions about risk management and insurance programs, the report finds that despite economic volatility, catastrophic climate events, supply chain and labour challenges and geopolitical uncertainty, the market has proved remarkable resiliency. Primary insurers are maintaining strategic growth targets and more flexibility on negotiations than in recent years.The portfolio remediations made during recent years resulted in a more stabilized market with increased competition and a more diversified appetite. However, economic uncertainty, costly reinsurance capacity, and accelerated frequency and severity of climate events has nevertheless required insurers to remain strategic about the capacity being deployed.The focus on risk quality will be top of mind for insurers and highlights the importance of risk mitigation for policy holders,"" said Russell Quilley, head of Commercial Risk Solutions and chief broking officer for Canada at Aon. ""Insurers require more information and stronger risk management practices than ever before as they navigate increasing volatility.""Other key findings include:Despite challenging headwinds, the Canadian property and casualty (P&amp;C) market ended 2022 with a healthy combined ratio of 85.44%, positioning the market to focus on strategic growth in 2023Canada experienced two of the top 10 global catastrophic events with the May derecho in Ontario and Quebec, and Hurricane Fiona, making it the third worst year for insured losses in Canadian history with an estimated $3.1 billion.The rise in reinsurance rates following challenging reinsurance treaty renewals has undoubtably impacted the Canadian property market, causing more strain on pricing and capacity for primary insurers. Insurers are managing their natural catastrophe exposures through such means as reducing capacity and placing sub-limits for weather events.There is a continued focus on valuations and clients should expect this to be a focal point during their renewal process.The sources of business disruption for companies have become a myriad of interconnected, complex, and diverse challenges contributing to a material increase in the cost of business interruption claims, causing it to be one of the top concerns for companies in 2023.What was once considered ancillary documentation, environmental, social and governance strategy and performance is now a baseline for a fulsome submission.The improvement in risk mitigation practices and cyber security controls have contributed to more favourable cyber market conditions.Story continuesClick here to access the Spring 2023 Canadian Insurance Market Update.About Aon Aon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

Projections indicate that this industry will continue to expand, with the fast food market expected to hit a $931.7 billion figure by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% from 2020 to 2027. The quick-service restaurant segment reigns supreme, capturing 42.59% of the worldwide fast-food market portion in 2019. It is anticipated to maintain its dominant position throughout the entire forecast period.The Rise of Expensive Fast Food and Fast Casual RestaurantsThe fast food and fast casual sectors, typically known for their quick and affordable meals, are now witnessing the emergence of upscale food joints. This trend reflects changing consumer preferences for elevated dining experiences, healthier ingredients, and premium quality food. Expensive fast food and fast casual restaurants cater to customers seeking convenience without compromising on taste or atmosphere. However, this shift also raises questions about the factors contributing to higher prices within the industry.As per Pricelisto, fast-food menu prices experienced a substantial jump in 2022, rising by approximately 13%, surpassing the 12% rise in grocery prices during the same period. This increase can be attributed to factors such as inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and consumer preferences shift.Factors Contributing to High Prices in the IndustryThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) witnessed a slight uptick of 0.1% between February 2023 and March 2023, reflecting a modest increase in the overall cost of food. Additionally, compared to March 2022, food prices surged by 8.5%, indicating a notable rise in the cost of food over the past year.Story continuesSeveral key factors contribute to the higher prices observed in expensive fast food and fast casual restaurants; some are discussed below:Sourcing high-quality ingredients and implementing stringent quality control measures entail additional costs.Investments in elegant decor, comfortable seating, and trendy ambiance elevate the dining experience.Labor costs increase due to the need for skilled chefs and attentive service staff.The incorporation of unique and innovative flavors, as well as customization options, adds value to the overall dining experience.The Impact of High Prices on the IndustryAccording to USDA, food prices are expected to rise by approximately 6.5%, falling between 4.9% to 8.2% during 2023. Specifically, prices for food-at-home are projected to increase by 6.6% (with a range of 4.4% to 8.8%), while food-away-from-home prices are anticipated to rise by 8.2% (with a range of 7.3 to 9%).The industry has experienced positive and negative effects from the surge in expensive fast food and fast casual restaurants. On the one hand, it has brought diversity to the market and opened up new revenue streams. However, the higher pricing may limit accessibility and narrow the customer base.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold According to Billionaire Carl Icahn. Carl Icahn, recognized for his expertise in the financial market, faced another blow on May 10 as the shares of his holding company experienced a significant decline. This drop in value occurred after Hindenburg Research, a short seller, released a damning report, resulting in a total valuation decrease of over $6 billion since the attack. On May 10 alone, CNBC mentioned that the shares plummeted by 15.1%, following a nearly 25% loss the previous week. On May 9, Hindenburg made allegations against Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP), claiming that the company had inflated the value of its holdings and relied on a structure resembling a ""Ponzi scheme"" to distribute dividends. CNBC reported that Icahn Enterprises said in its latest 10-Q filing:“The U.S. Attorney’s office has not made any claims or allegations against us or Mr. Icahn with respect to the foregoing inquiry.”According to a report by The Street, Hindenburg's note to investors stated that Icahn’s last winning year was 2013, when the fund outperformed the market and returned 30.8%. From 2014 onwards, Carl Icahn's investment portfolio has experienced a decline of 53%, says Hindenburg. Meanwhile, during the same timeframe, the S&amp;P index has generated a return of 147%. According to Hindenburg's assessment, Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP) is described as paying out dividends that are ""mathematically unsustainable."" This conclusion is drawn from the fact that despite a negative free cash flow of $4.9 billion from 2014 onwards, the company has distributed $1.5 billion in cash dividends during that same period. Hindenburg further noted:""The company has supported its dividend and declining asset values by selling $1.7 billion through ATM (at the market) unit sales over the past four years... In short, Icahn has been using money from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors.""Story continuesCarl Icahn dismissed the report as biased and defended the accuracy of IEP's financial statements. Icahn is the majority owner of IEP, retaining approximately 85% of the company, and he has utilized more than 60% of his shares as collateral for personal loans. As a result of the Hindenburg report, Icahn's wealth has plummeted by $7.5 billion, leading to a final net worth of $10.8 billion for him, according to Forbes. In this article, we discuss the 15 top stocks to buy and hold according to billionaire Carl Icahn. These include FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SWX), and Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX). Our Methodology For this list, we selected top 15 stocks from the Q1 2023 13F portfolio of Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises LP.

International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Icahn Capital LP’s Stake Value: $59,269,000International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.

(NYSE:IFF) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“We are still getting used to the higher multiples that investors will pay for larger market cap and pure play companies such as IFF. We do understand the market’s rationale. IFF’s products account for a small percentage of the customers’ cost while playing critical roles in the products’ performance. With some operating leverage, the company can probably grow FCF at 4-6% a year. This brings the total return close to the long-term return of the S&amp;P 500 index of 10%. Through trial and error, we have come to appreciate how scale, higher market share, route densities, switching costs, and collaborative relationships amongst major industry players can contribute to sustained high returns on invested capital.”14.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.75. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.78. PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.22 and as low as 9.75, with a median of 11.54, all within the past year.PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.98. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.99. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.15.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.65. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.27. Over the past 12 months, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.02 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.62.Story continuesValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.21. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.32.Finally, investors should note that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.60. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 14.65. Over the past year, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.01 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 10.04.These are only a few of the key metrics included in PACCAR's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its shareholder-value-boosting efforts are well-recognized by investors.AmEx — with a market cap of $113 billion — is a diversified financial services company, offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining in your portfolio at the moment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXP’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $11.16 per share, indicating 13.3% year-over-year growth. The stock has witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past week against none in the opposite direction. American Express beat on earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed twice. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues stands at $61 billion, suggesting a 15.4% rise from the prior-year reported number. In the long run, the company expects revenue growth of more than 10% and earnings growth in the mid-teens.AmEx’s growing card member acquisitions indicate that new clients and younger generations are being attracted toward its product offerings. Total network volumes are expected to continue on its growth path as the company expands into more developing economies. Our estimate for network volumes for 2023 indicates a 15.6% year-over-year increase.Higher loan volumes are likely to keep boosting its U.S. Consumer Services segment, which witnessed a 25% year-over-year jump in revenues, net of interest expenses, in the first quarter. Our estimate for total card member loans for 2023 indicates 13.4% growth from that reported a year ago.AmEx’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are noteworthy. Owing to its solid capital position, the company returned $4.9 billion to its shareholders in 2022. Further, it hiked quarterly dividends by 15% to 60 cents per share in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesKey RisksHowever, there are a few factors that might hinder the stock’s growth.Rising expenses are trimming its margins. Last year, expenses jumped 24% year over year. We expect total expenses for 2023 to jump 11.9% year over year. Also, AXP’s 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple of 13X is higher than 11X of the industry, making it a little expensive at the current level.

The positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiments, indicating robust fundamentals and sparking the expectation of outperformance in the near term.Although continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction are pressing concerns, MLM sees solid near-term product demand reinforced by healthy customer backlogs across the coast-to-coast footprint, led by infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale.Additionally, builder sentiment has improved in Martin Marietta geographies as the single-family housing shortage continues to drive a base level of demand in key Sun Belt markets.

Within the Building Materials business, total aggregate pricing per ton is anticipated to grow 13-15%.Higher Infrastructural Spending: Martin Marietta, and other concrete and aggregates producers are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges is expected to help MLM.The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports, and the power grid to drive growth in 2023. MLM anticipates substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, a strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.In the near term, the company expects affordability-driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market. This will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment, and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.Long-Term Plans: Martin Marietta has been gaining strength from long-term strategic plans — markedly SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives. It is noted that 2022 marked the 11th year of consecutive growth in consolidated product and service revenues, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA.Martin Marietta has been focusing on SOAR plans that include portfolio optimization, assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing footprint in core businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in high-growth markets, and pursuing new opportunities associated with the existing markets served.Select Inorganic Moves: The company has been reviewing its overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value by monetizing or exchanging select assets.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.51 billion, indicating a 21.5% decline from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 92 cents per share. This suggests a year-over-year decline of 32.4%.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -3.2%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderNVIDIA’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s last quarter results had shown early signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% sequentially in the last reported quarter. NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 13% sequentially. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter for both end markets.Moreover, the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA’s first-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company’s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in five of the last seven quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and artificial intelligence cockpit solutions.Story continuesHowever, we opine that ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, like high inflation and interest rates, are likely to have continued to hurt the sales of NVIDIA’s desktop workstation GPUs in the first quarter. Additionally, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented across several parts of China might have weighed on the overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVDA this earnings season.

""As a result, we have a very clear strategy, our company is stronger than it's been in years, and we're only getting stronger.""In his annual update to shareowners, Sorgi highlighted the company's transformation into a premier regulated utility holding company — a transformation that eliminated the risk of foreign ownership, positioned PPL to deliver top-tier earnings and dividend growth of 6% to 8% annually through at least 2026, sharpened PPL's clean energy strategy, and resulted in a balance sheet capable of supporting growth and investment without the need for equity issuances through at least 2026.With its transformation now complete, Sorgi said PPL's vision is to be the best at delivering both safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to customers and competitive, long-term returns to shareowners. He added that PPL's priorities center around creating utilities that are agile, innovative and technology-enabled to drive additional value for customers and shareowners and support a reliable, affordable clean energy transition. In pursuit of this strategy, PPL's 2023 priorities include:Investing $2.5 billion in 2023 to strengthen network reliability and resiliency, part of $12 billion in planned investments through 2026 to improve service, advance the clean energy transition and meet customers' evolving needs.Achieving PPL's 2023 previously announced ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share, with a midpoint of $1.58 per share.Delivering $50-60 million in annual operation and maintenance savings as the company executes its business transformation initiatives and builds to a targeted $175 million in annual savings by 2026.Securing Kentucky Public Service Commission approval to retire 1,500 megawatts of aging coal units and replace them with reliable, least-cost generation by 2028, including approximately 1,200 megawatts of natural gas combined-cycle generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar power and 125 megawatts of battery storage.Story continuesLooking ahead, Sorgi said he is confident in the company's strategy, its business plan and its employees, who care deeply about PPL's mission.""I'm as excited as ever about PPL's future,"" Sorgi concluded. ""And we are absolutely ready and eager to showcase our strengths as we deliver on our vision and mission to drive long-term value for our customers and shareowners.""In addition to Sorgi's business update, PPL's annual meeting included action on several management proposals. During the meeting, PPL shareowners elected 10 directors to one-year terms; approved by non-binding advisory vote the executive compensation of the company's named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement; approved by non-binding advisory vote a frequency of one year for future votes on executive compensation; and ratified the appointment of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP as PPL's independent registered public accounting firm for 2023.

(NYSE:RMD) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 74% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resmed-inc-nyse-rmd-favoured-145733395.html,1684335453,STORY,['RMD'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, ResMed's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 18 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of ResMed. View our latest analysis for ResMed ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ResMed?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.ResMed already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at ResMed's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in ResMed. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. With 9.1% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of ResMedWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that ResMed Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$298m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in ResMed. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for ResMed   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our discussion on Buffett’s recent investment decisions and go directly to Warren Buffett's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) has been able to generate an average annualized return of 20% in the last 58 years under the ownership of Warren Buffett. This has contributed towards the 92-year-old becoming the fifth richest person in the world as of May 2023, with a net worth of $114.8 billion. Buffett has secured the fifth position despite making significant donations worth around $48 billion to leading charities like Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. In the last six decades, Buffett has generated a return that is twice as high as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index's return over the same timeframe. If we incorporate the impact of compounding into the equation, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 24,708% since 1965. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway has generated a return of 3,784,464%, which is 153 times higher than the benchmark index.Furthermore, the billionaire has been able to outperform the broader market in 39 out of the last 58 years. The astute investment strategy of the veteran can be gauged by the fact that he is expected to make $5.7 billion in cash during 2023 from the dividend-paying stocks in his portfolio. Some of the notable dividend-paying stocks in Buffett’s portfolio are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and the Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). Buffett has been a long-term proponent of dividend paying stocks.During Q1 2023, the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio increased by $26 billion to $325 billion. According to the filings, Buffett disposed of his entire stake worth $1.4 billion in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) during the latest quarter. These transactions represent the continued reduction of longstanding bank investments by the billionaire. Berkshire Hathaway's positions in US banks significantly decreased between 2020 and 2022. Some of the sales were carried out shortly before the turmoil in the banking system began in March. At the annual shareholders meeting this month, Buffett revealed that he is maintaining a cautious stance on holding bank stocks. However, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) continues to be an exception, forming a significant part of the billionaire’s portfolio. Buffett increased his investments in several other financial stocks. He initiated a position worth $954 million in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) and boosted its stake in Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) by $10.6 million.

(NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Holdings: $2,468,499,999Percentage of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Portfolio: 0.75%The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a Cincinnati, Ohio-based operator of supermarket chains across the US. The company intends to complete its $24.6 billion merger with Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) in the near future. Both these companies have a cumulative sum of nearly 5,000 stores spread across 48 states. The merger is expected to create an entity that could compete against retail giants like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both entities intend to offload 250 to 300 stores to address anti-trust concerns.Here's what Oakmark Funds said about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Citigroup Inc.

(NYSE:DVA) is a Denver, Colorado-based healthcare company that provides kidney care services. It is one of the largest providers of dialysis services in the US. The company's primary focus is on the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure. In an update issued on May 15, Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein increased the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) from $88 to $100 after the company increased its 2023 guidance on May 9.Here's what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)10.

(NASDAQ:ATVI) received the green flag from the European Commission for its takeover by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) on May 16. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to buy the Santa Monica, California-based video game company in an all-cash deal of $95 per share in April 2022. However, the deal is still pending due to regulatory approvals. Although the European Union (EU) has approved the deal, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has blocked it due to concerns related to the future of cloud gaming. Warren Buffett’s stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) was initiated in Q4 2021. The hedge fund increased its stake in the company by more than three times in the sequential quarter.Here’s what Atai Capital said about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Those familiar with Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) will quickly realize this is by no means a small-cap stock and boasts a rather large $66B market cap. While our focus is firmly on small-cap stocks, there will be occasions when I see something in large-cap land that piques my interest.For those unfamiliar with Activision Blizzard, they are a video game developer and publisher being acquired by Microsoft at $95/share. They develop and own IPs such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Candy Crush. These are some of the most valuable IPs in gaming, from both a business perspective and a popularity perspective. I’ve been an avid gamer for years and am not a fan of most of their games (quite the opposite actually), but I can still appreciate how valuable these IPs are. Activision games have some of the lowest expectations in the industry but still sell millions of copies. They are currently churning out a new Call of Duty every other year with practically no differences between the titles, and yet gamers consistently buy these “new” releases, every, single, time. In fact, the most recent release (MW2) was the fastest-selling COD game ever, amassing over $1B in sales in the first ten days after release. Candy Crush has been the top-grossing game franchise in the U.S app stores for twenty- two quarters in a row, and Diablo 4 is very likely to out-sell its predecessor Diablo 3 (30M+ copies over its lifetime) while being just as monetized via in-game skins and DLC’s if not better. Throw in the gaming secular tailwind, a highly competent CEO – Bobby Kotick, and I consider Activision to be a great business (what I’ve stated here is just high level of course) …” (Please click here to read the full text)8.

You can skip our discussion on Buffett’s recent investment decisions and go directly to Warren Buffett's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) has been able to generate an average annualized return of 20% in the last 58 years under the ownership of Warren Buffett. This has contributed towards the 92-year-old becoming the fifth richest person in the world as of May 2023, with a net worth of $114.8 billion. Buffett has secured the fifth position despite making significant donations worth around $48 billion to leading charities like Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. In the last six decades, Buffett has generated a return that is twice as high as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index's return over the same timeframe. If we incorporate the impact of compounding into the equation, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 24,708% since 1965. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway has generated a return of 3,784,464%, which is 153 times higher than the benchmark index.Furthermore, the billionaire has been able to outperform the broader market in 39 out of the last 58 years. The astute investment strategy of the veteran can be gauged by the fact that he is expected to make $5.7 billion in cash during 2023 from the dividend-paying stocks in his portfolio. Some of the notable dividend-paying stocks in Buffett’s portfolio are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and the Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). Buffett has been a long-term proponent of dividend paying stocks.During Q1 2023, the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio increased by $26 billion to $325 billion. According to the filings, Buffett disposed of his entire stake worth $1.4 billion in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) during the latest quarter. These transactions represent the continued reduction of longstanding bank investments by the billionaire. Berkshire Hathaway's positions in US banks significantly decreased between 2020 and 2022. Some of the sales were carried out shortly before the turmoil in the banking system began in March. At the annual shareholders meeting this month, Buffett revealed that he is maintaining a cautious stance on holding bank stocks. However, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) continues to be an exception, forming a significant part of the billionaire’s portfolio. Buffett increased his investments in several other financial stocks. He initiated a position worth $954 million in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) and boosted its stake in Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) by $10.6 million. The Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway owned 46 individual stocks as of Q1 2023.Story continuesWarren Buffett's 2023 Portfolio Top Stock Picks Our MethodologyWe picked the top 15 stocks from the Q1 2023 portfolio of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. These 15 stocks represent over 94% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. The stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund's stake in them during Q1 2023.

Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.33% as of May 18.Matrix Asset Advisors shared its stance on Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We sold our position in Kimberly-Clark to fund better investment opportunities and our holding in Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) over our concerns about the level of the dividend during a peak spending year for the company as it invests in its streaming business, which is showing strong growth. We believe that Paramount Global will be successful as an independent company or acquired by someone else for its valuable assets and media franchise. We continue to own the stock in our LCV portfolios for its meaningful appreciation potential but concluded that at this time it was not an appropriate holding for our Dividend strategy.”14. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Holdings: $2,468,499,999Percentage of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Portfolio: 0.75%The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a Cincinnati, Ohio-based operator of supermarket chains across the US. The company intends to complete its $24.6 billion merger with Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) in the near future. Both these companies have a cumulative sum of nearly 5,000 stores spread across 48 states. The merger is expected to create an entity that could compete against retail giants like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both entities intend to offload 250 to 300 stores to address anti-trust concerns.Here's what Oakmark Funds said about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Citigroup Inc.

(NASDAQ:VRSN) was held by 40 hedge funds as of Q4 2022.11. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Holdings: $2,927,711,683Percentage of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Portfolio: 0.9%DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a Denver, Colorado-based healthcare company that provides kidney care services. It is one of the largest providers of dialysis services in the US. The company's primary focus is on the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure. In an update issued on May 15, Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein increased the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) from $88 to $100 after the company increased its 2023 guidance on May 9.Here's what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)10.

(NASDAQ:ATVI) received the green flag from the European Commission for its takeover by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) on May 16. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to buy the Santa Monica, California-based video game company in an all-cash deal of $95 per share in April 2022. However, the deal is still pending due to regulatory approvals. Although the European Union (EU) has approved the deal, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has blocked it due to concerns related to the future of cloud gaming. Warren Buffett’s stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) was initiated in Q4 2021. The hedge fund increased its stake in the company by more than three times in the sequential quarter.Here’s what Atai Capital said about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Those familiar with Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) will quickly realize this is by no means a small-cap stock and boasts a rather large $66B market cap. While our focus is firmly on small-cap stocks, there will be occasions when I see something in large-cap land that piques my interest.For those unfamiliar with Activision Blizzard, they are a video game developer and publisher being acquired by Microsoft at $95/share. They develop and own IPs such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Candy Crush. These are some of the most valuable IPs in gaming, from both a business perspective and a popularity perspective. I’ve been an avid gamer for years and am not a fan of most of their games (quite the opposite actually), but I can still appreciate how valuable these IPs are. Activision games have some of the lowest expectations in the industry but still sell millions of copies. They are currently churning out a new Call of Duty every other year with practically no differences between the titles, and yet gamers consistently buy these “new” releases, every, single, time. In fact, the most recent release (MW2) was the fastest-selling COD game ever, amassing over $1B in sales in the first ten days after release. Candy Crush has been the top-grossing game franchise in the U.S app stores for twenty- two quarters in a row, and Diablo 4 is very likely to out-sell its predecessor Diablo 3 (30M+ copies over its lifetime) while being just as monetized via in-game skins and DLC’s if not better. Throw in the gaming secular tailwind, a highly competent CEO – Bobby Kotick, and I consider Activision to be a great business (what I’ve stated here is just high level of course) …” (Please click here to read the full text)8.

(NYSE:BRK-B) has been able to generate an average annualized return of 20% in the last 58 years under the ownership of Warren Buffett. This has contributed towards the 92-year-old becoming the fifth richest person in the world as of May 2023, with a net worth of $114.8 billion. Buffett has secured the fifth position despite making significant donations worth around $48 billion to leading charities like Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. In the last six decades, Buffett has generated a return that is twice as high as the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index's return over the same timeframe. If we incorporate the impact of compounding into the equation, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 24,708% since 1965. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway has generated a return of 3,784,464%, which is 153 times higher than the benchmark index.Furthermore, the billionaire has been able to outperform the broader market in 39 out of the last 58 years. The astute investment strategy of the veteran can be gauged by the fact that he is expected to make $5.7 billion in cash during 2023 from the dividend-paying stocks in his portfolio. Some of the notable dividend-paying stocks in Buffett’s portfolio are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and the Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). Buffett has been a long-term proponent of dividend paying stocks.During Q1 2023, the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio increased by $26 billion to $325 billion. According to the filings, Buffett disposed of his entire stake worth $1.4 billion in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) during the latest quarter. These transactions represent the continued reduction of longstanding bank investments by the billionaire. Berkshire Hathaway's positions in US banks significantly decreased between 2020 and 2022. Some of the sales were carried out shortly before the turmoil in the banking system began in March. At the annual shareholders meeting this month, Buffett revealed that he is maintaining a cautious stance on holding bank stocks. However, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) continues to be an exception, forming a significant part of the billionaire’s portfolio.

We believe that Paramount Global will be successful as an independent company or acquired by someone else for its valuable assets and media franchise. We continue to own the stock in our LCV portfolios for its meaningful appreciation potential but concluded that at this time it was not an appropriate holding for our Dividend strategy.”14. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Holdings: $2,468,499,999Percentage of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s Portfolio: 0.75%The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a Cincinnati, Ohio-based operator of supermarket chains across the US. The company intends to complete its $24.6 billion merger with Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) in the near future. Both these companies have a cumulative sum of nearly 5,000 stores spread across 48 states. The merger is expected to create an entity that could compete against retail giants like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both entities intend to offload 250 to 300 stores to address anti-trust concerns.Here's what Oakmark Funds said about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Citigroup Inc.

260,c7d90f6d-b3fb-3c96-9eeb-8d2e72177395,DVA,2023-05-19,Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) TAVR Study Outcome Favorable,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edwards-lifesciences-ew-tavr-study-171205114.html,1684429925,STORY,"['EW', 'ADUS', 'DVA', 'MMSI']","[Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW recently presented the new results from the Benchmark Registry in Europe showing the safety and efficacy of shortened treatment pathway for patients getting balloon-expandable valves during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The data was given at EuroPCR 2023 at a late-breaking clinical data session.The recent development will fortify Edwards’ transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart.Study DetailsThe goal of the study was to determine whether implementing a set of tailored Benchmark practises could shorten hospital length of stay (LOS), increase the occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and increase patient and staff satisfaction while maintaining patient safety. The study looked at 2,405 patients who underwent TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve at 28 sites across seven European countries.With a focus on conscious sedation, recovery outside of the IC, and a target of next-day discharge, the Edwards Benchmark programme standardises a minimum approach to TAVR that unlocks the inherent advantages of the procedure's less intrusive nature while maintaining patient outcomes.Patients who underwent TAVR had ICU stays cut by 25% and median hospital stay reduced by 33%, while still maintaining 30-day clinical outcomes comparable to those of patients treated prior to the establishment of the Benchmark route. Researchers came to the conclusion that expanding the use of Benchmark best practises will increase the TAVR pathway's effectiveness without lowering patient safety.The trial results showed great patient satisfaction with all aspects of the Benchmark practises, scoring above 90% on post-procedure patient satisfaction surveys, in addition to a noticeable reduction in ICU stay and hospital stay with no loss of patient safety after 30 days.Significance of the StudyThe findings of this study confirm the value of the Edwards Benchmark programme for standardizing clinical pathways for patients undergoing TAVI (TAVR) in Europe. The findings show substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing patient safety.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Benchmark Registry adds to the expanding body of research that shows TAVR to be a triple-win procedure that not only improves patient quality of life but also lowers costs for the healthcare system.

OMCL is well poised for growth in coming quarters owing to strong execution of strategies, disciplined cost management and revenue timing. An increase in Omnicell’s service revenues emphasizes its digital transformation strategy. However, stiff competition and mounting operating expenses raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has plunged 33.6% compared with a 23.7% fall of the industry and a 6.3% drop of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device solutions provider has a market capitalization of $3.26 billion. Its first-quarter 2023 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 457.1%. The long-term expected growth rate is estimated at 13.7% compared with the industry’s projection of 16.6%.Let’s delve deeperQ1 Upsides: Omnicell ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues, driven by strong execution, disciplined cost management and revenue timing. Reported revenues exceeded the high end of Omnicell’s previous revenue outlook in the band of $273-$283 million, which is highly appreciated. The year-over-year increase in Omnicell’s service revenues emphasizes its digital transformation strategy.Omnicell is well-positioned to meet pharmacy and hospital needs, backed by the recent acquisitions and expansion of its advanced services solutions. Strong revenue contributions from the recent acquisitions of FDS Amplicare, ReCept and MarkeTouch Media are major tailwinds. The company’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service continues to receive more demand from health systems, which buoys optimism.2025 Roadmap Looks Impressive: In terms of its 2025 financial roadmap, Omnicell aims to generate $1.9-$2 billion in revenues by 2025, suggesting a 14-15% compounded total annual revenue growth rate from 2021 to 2025.

Operating expenses were up 2.1% year over year. The operating loss in the quarter totaled $23 million compared to the operating profit of $5.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Competitive Landscape: Omnicell faces intense competition in the medication management and supply chain solutions market.

262,0d26daf6-3f72-3fa0-a08c-988ebdf0359a,DVA,2023-05-19,BD's (BDX) New FDA Approval to Improve MRSA Diagnostics,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bds-bdx-fda-approval-improve-151503065.html,1684422903,STORY,"['BDX', 'HOLX', 'DVA']","[Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, recently received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the new BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) imaging application. The application uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret bacterial growth and release negative specimens with minimal human interaction.The AI-based imaging application is backed by the BD BBL CHROMagar MRSA II screening plates and powered by BD Synapsys Informatics Solution. The application can be used with both standalone BD Kiestra ReadA systems and track-based BD Kiestra laboratory automation solutions.The latest regulatory approval is expected to solidify BD’s foothold in the global Diagnostics business, thereby boosting its overall Life Sciences segment.Significance of the ApprovalPer the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MRSA in hospital settings may cause severe problems, including blood stream or surgical-site infections, sepsis and even death. As performing a lab test is the only way to determine if a particular kind of infection is caused by MRSA, the ability to run these tests efficiently and effectively may have a significant impact on patient treatment.The BD Kiestra MRSA application uses AI to automate the traditional labor and time-intensive task of inspecting Petri dishes to determine the presence or absence of bacterial growth. This will likely enable medical laboratory scientists and technicians to focus more on higher-value analysis. The application is also expected to assess single specimens or group together the large volume of plates with non-significant growth for batch review and release of negative results. This, in turn, may help reduce the administrative burden on technicians.The MRSA imaging application uses AI algorithms to look for specific culture characteristics on the BBL CHROMagar MRSA II plate. Based on that information and analysis by BD Synapsys informatics, the plate images are automatically organized and sorted into meaningful worklists for laboratory scientists and technicians.Story continuesPer management, the pandemic led to significant and ongoing labor challenges in laboratories. Management believes that since reading plates is a labor-intense and potentially error-prone process in microbiology, the use of the imaging application to automatically organize specimens in meaningful worklists may help use limited laboratory staff more efficiently. It will likely allow lab personnel to concentrate on more critical and complex specimens.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global molecular diagnostics market is anticipated to reach $30.2 billion by 2027 from $23.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Factors like the emergence of new viruses, technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and the growing awareness of early disease diagnosis are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Recent Developments in Life Sciences ArmThis month, BD announced its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it recorded solid top-line and bottom-line results and improvements in the overall base revenues. Robust performances by both geographic regions were also seen. The BD Life Sciences segment’s Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business unit saw growth in Microbiology. The Biosciences business unit also registered continued double-digit growth in Research Reagents.In March, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the BD Vaginal Panel on the BD COR System.In February, BD received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test.Price PerformanceShares of BD have gained 0.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 10.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 6.9% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, BD carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Axis Capital has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Cincinnati Financial has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AXS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.AXS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.01, while CINF has a forward P/E of 22.18. We also note that AXS has a PEG ratio of 1.40. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CINF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.44.Another notable valuation metric for AXS is its P/B ratio of 1.05. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CINF has a P/B of 1.50.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, AXS holds a Value grade of A, while CINF has a Value grade of C.AXS stands above CINF thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that AXS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

269,785c7723-4611-3709-93eb-04f4ec301c44,GE,2023-05-19,Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Electric Company (GE) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-electric-130001878.html,1684414801,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned +4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which GE falls in, has lost 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share, indicating a change of -42.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +13.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -22.5%. This estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +96.8% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For GE, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -19.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $62.19 billion and $67.6 billion estimates indicate -18.8% and +8.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.69%. The EPS surprise was +107.69%.Over the last four quarters, GE surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of Regency.Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of Regency’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Regency's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. Regency provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to Nareit FFO.Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with 10%+ Yield. Dividend investing is gaining popularity on the back of increasing market volatility and investors' hunger for regular income. According to a report by CNBC, yearly dividend payouts of the S&amp;P 500 companies have grown from $420 billion in 2017 to $483 billion in 2020. The dividend payments finally hit their all-time high of $561 billion last year, as reported by Wall Street Journal.Dividend yields are an important aspect of dividend investment as it measures the income generated by an investment in the form of dividends. Additionally, as companies increase their dividends over time, the yield on the original investment may also increase, which makes high-dividend yield stocks valuable for long-term investors. That being said, analysts consider dividend yields between 2% to 6% healthy as high dividend yields can sometimes be a signal of risk. If a company offers an unusually high yield compared to its peers, it could indicate financial instability or other issues. For this reason, seasoned investors always carry out meticulous research and consider the respective company’s financials before investing.Some industries, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities, offer high yields to investors while maintaining strong dividend policies. This means that companies with strong dividend growth track records and high yields could be reliable options for investors. This conforms to the historical returns of high-dividend stocks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned the S&amp;P Global’s data which revealed that the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by a wide margin from December 1999 to June 2019. The S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index tracks the performance of companies with over 20 consecutive years of dividend growth.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks with over 5% YieldIn addition to dividend yield, dividend growth track record is also a key factor when it comes to gauging a company's dividend safety and reliability.

The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $407.37, up 1.22% from the previous day’s closing price of $402.47.The company has been benefiting from solid pricing across businesses amid low volume.

The positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiments, indicating robust fundamentals and sparking the expectation of outperformance in the near term.Although continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction are pressing concerns, MLM sees solid near-term product demand reinforced by healthy customer backlogs across the coast-to-coast footprint, led by infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale.Additionally, builder sentiment has improved in Martin Marietta geographies as the single-family housing shortage continues to drive a base level of demand in key Sun Belt markets.

It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, a strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.In the near term, the company expects affordability-driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market. This will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment, and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.Long-Term Plans: Martin Marietta has been gaining strength from long-term strategic plans — markedly SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives. It is noted that 2022 marked the 11th year of consecutive growth in consolidated product and service revenues, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA.Martin Marietta has been focusing on SOAR plans that include portfolio optimization, assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing footprint in core businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in high-growth markets, and pursuing new opportunities associated with the existing markets served.Select Inorganic Moves: The company has been reviewing its overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value by monetizing or exchanging select assets.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for American Airlines basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for American Airlines imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for American AirlinesThis world's largest airline is expected to earn $2.71 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 442%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for American Airlines. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 15.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of American Airlines to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AAL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 14% in the last month. But that can't change the reality that over the longer term (five years), the returns have been really quite dismal. Indeed, the share price is down 65% in the period. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. Of course, this could be the start of a turnaround.While the last five years has been tough for American Airlines Group shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. View our latest analysis for American Airlines Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.American Airlines Group became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.Arguably, the revenue drop of 3.6% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. If you are thinking of buying or selling American Airlines Group stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 5.8% in the last year, American Airlines Group shareholders lost 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, longer term shareholders are suffering worse, given the loss of 10% doled out over the last five years. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  American Airlines Group is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant...For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:PFG), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$17b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 4.3% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Principal Financial Group. View our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Principal Financial Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Principal Financial Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Principal Financial Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Principal Financial Group is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Principal Financial GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Principal Financial Group, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$62m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Principal Financial Group  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks to Sell in 2023 According to Billionaire Steve Cohen. Point72 Asset Management of billionaire Steve Cohen recently disclosed its Q1 holdings. The fund's portfolio worth stood at $32.29 billion by the end of March 2023, up 9.74% from its the previous quarter.Bloomberg cited Steve Cohen on May 17, who said that investors' excessive concern about a potential market decline is causing them to overlook the significant opportunities presented by artificial intelligence. He believes that being overly preoccupied with the probability of a recession might cause them to miss out on the substantial potential for growth and success. Cohen emphasized the importance of recognizing and capitalizing on the ""big wave"" of opportunities that arise from advancements in artificial intelligence. Cohen expressed his belief that the emerging field of artificial intelligence will likely generate new employment opportunities. Although he expressed concerns about the potential displacement of certain jobs, he anticipates that overall profit margins will improve. This improvement would alleviate the need for the Federal Reserve to implement further interest rate hikes as a measure to control inflation. As a result, Cohen expects that such a scenario would positively impact the markets and contribute to their growth. Steve Cohen said he is “actually pretty bullish”. Institutional Investor estimated that Steve Cohen, the founder of Point72 Asset Management and owner of the New York Mets, generated personal capital gains of over $1.7 billion from his hedge fund last year. The hedge fund itself achieved a net gain of approximately 10% in 2022. It is worth noting that this estimation does not account for the founder's share of the fees generated by the hedge fund, implying that his total earnings were likely even higher than the reported figure.Story continuesIn Q1 2023, Steve Cohen’s hedge fund acquired 1182 new stocks, sold off 469 stocks entirely, made additional purchases in 368 stocks, and reduced holdings in 505 stocks. Some of the popular stocks the billionaire dumped include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Stocks to Sell in 2023 According to Billionaire Steve CohenOur Methodology For this list, we selected the most popular stocks removed from billionaire Steve Cohen’s 13F portfolio during the first quarter of 2023. Cohen's fund sold its entire stakes in these companies in the March quarter. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm as of Q4 2022. Stocks to Sell in 2023 According to Billionaire Steve Cohen10. Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) specializes in the development, production, and distribution of specialized chemicals for various industries. The company is divided into three main segments - Lithium, Bromine, and Catalysts. In Q4 2022, Steve Cohen owned 64,962 shares of Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), worth $14 million. In Q1 2023, the billionaire disposed of his entire stake in the company. He also discarded his stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).On May 11, KeyBanc last night upgraded Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $270 price target. The analyst believes that the risk/reward ratio for lithium has improved following the company's recent earnings report. They anticipate an upturn in demand for lithium in China, which has been experiencing a downturn since November 2022. According to channel checks conducted within the Chinese lithium industry, inventories at the battery cell and electric vehicle levels are declining and expected to reach a low point in the next few months. The analyst suggests that this could lead to a resumption of purchase orders from major buyers in the near future.According to Insider Monkey's fourth quarter database, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company.Carillon Tower Advisors made the following comment about Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine, and refining catalysts. The stock gave back some of its recent gains amid investor concerns about how the future price of lithium could be affected by a potential decelerating rate of growth in overall electric vehicle (EV) production and demand, primarily in China. Despite these potential near-term headwinds, longer-term the global lithium market remains tight, and Albemarle plays a critical role in the battery value chain and remains well-positioned for the overall continued global adoption of EVs.”9. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that allows hosts worldwide to offer accommodations and experiences to guests. Using a marketplace model, the company's platform enables hosts and guests to connect and book spaces and experiences online or through mobile devices. In Q4 2022, Cohen owned 314,926 shares of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) worth nearly $27 million, which he sold in the first quarter of 2023. On May 9, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.18 and a revenue of $1.82 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $30 million, respectively. During the first quarter, the total number of active listings increased by 18% compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth rate was higher than the 16% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson lowered the firm's price target on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) on May 10 to $105 from $135 and kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares. Although the company's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, the management's guidance for Q2 Nights fell well below the consensus. Erickson anticipates that there will be greater pressure on the marginal Average Daily Rate in the future. Due to the company's high valuation and a clearer understanding of the structural limits on room night growth, RBC prefers to wait for a more significant pullback before recommending a more positive stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s stock.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 54 hedge funds were bullish on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), compared to 58 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.16 million shares worth $269.4 million. In addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cohen disposed of his Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stake. Artisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included online travel marketplace Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Airbnb outperformed on the resilience of the travel category including for long-term stays, and on operating leverage as cost optimization is met with revenue increases. Notably, our top four holdings entering the quarter (Sea, Meli, Nvidia, Airbnb) which represented 24.37% of capital on December 31, 2022, increased an average of 64.42% during the quarter.”8. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been distributing cash dividends every quarter since 1965, and the year 2023 signifies the 51st consecutive year in which the company has raised its annual dividend, making it a dividend king. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) declared a $1.265 per share quarterly dividend, a 10% increase from its prior dividend of $1.150. The dividend is payable on June 30, to shareholders of record as of June 2. Although PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a strong history of paying dividends, Steve Cohen sold all of his shares in the company during the first quarter of 2023, worth approximately $80 million as of Q4 2022. On April 27, Barclays raised the firm's price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $206 from $201 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.

These projects aim to reduce absolute water use and replenish back into the local watershed more than 100% of the water used at company-owned and third-party sites in high water-risk areas.”7. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) develops solutions that empower merchants to receive payments via card and also offer reporting and analysis features, as well as prompt settlement on the following day. The company increased its projections for 2023 and reported Q1 earnings that surpassed expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cohen held 587,303 shares of the company worth $37 million. However, during the first quarter of 2023, the billionaire sold all of his shares in Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ). On May 11, CLSA analyst John Marrin downgraded Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to Underperform from Buy with a price target of $63, down from $93, and expressed concerns about the macro environment that outweigh the firm's optimism about the company's long-term growth potential. The analyst believes that there is a growing likelihood of a ""hard landing"" in the U.S. during the latter half of 2023, as regional banks' withdrawal puts more pressure on consumers and small businesses, who are already struggling with high interest rates. Despite posting decent earnings last week, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s stock performance has trailed the market, and investors may already be anticipating lower earnings in 2024, the analyst wrote in the research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 70 hedge funds were bullish on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), compared to 75 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 9 million shares worth $565.7 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”6. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) offers online reservation services for travel and restaurants worldwide. These services include accommodation reservations through Booking.com, rental car reservations through Rentalcars.com, travel reservation services, hotel distribution services, and vacation packages and cruises through Priceline, as well as flight, ground transportation, and activities reservation services through Agoda. The company also operates KAYAK, an online meta-search service, and OpenTable for booking online restaurant reservations. In Q4 2022, Cohen owned 66,448 shares of Booking Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $11.60 and a revenue of $3.78 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.86 and $30 million, respectively.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), all of which posted double-digit gains.Online travel services provider Booking Holdings reported strong results in the quarter with gross bookings well above pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the outlook for consumer travel continued to be relatively strong.

Margins now seem brighter for these retailers and consumer-goods makers, who in the past few weeks sounded more optimistic about the metric than they did last quarter.This is true especially for companies that make or sell essentials such as groceries and household staples, and even for restaurants and cafes, as strong wage gains in a tight labor market underpin consumer spending.Still, people are being cautious about big-ticket, discretionary spending, and a bump from the lifting of COVID curbs in China has been slower than expected. Some analysts said a full recovery in margins is a few quarters away.According to Refinitiv data as of May 12, quarterly margins for consumer discretionary components of the S&amp;P 500 index is expected to increase year-over-year for every quarter this year.""In this environment of uncertainty ... (consumer staples) margins are going to be solid because most of the input costs going into staples are falling precipitously and that's the positive,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.""They have (raised prices enough) ... and they have held that price, so they are only going to see improvement in margins.""Full-year sales and earnings outlook for Target Corp, which saw margins improve in the first quarter, implies a margin range of 4.7% to 5.0%, up from 3.5% in 2022, according to D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker.Kraft Heinz Chief Financial Officer Andre Maciel said earlier this month that commodity costs were falling slightly faster than expected.The maker of Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Jell-O said its gross margins in the quarter ended March improved by about 130 basis points. The company joined a list of consumer staples firms including Kellogg Co and PepsiCo Inc in raising its annual forecast for 2023.Story continuesPepsiCo reported March-quarter margins, or the ratio of gross profit to revenue for the company, that were higher than a year earlier and said its average selling price increased 16% in the quarter.Prices at rival Coca-Cola Co rose by 11%, and though quarterly margins fell from the same period a year earlier, they improved from the prior quarter.Margins at McDonald's Corp and Starbucks Corp improved as well.'STUBBORN INFLATION'But retail giant Walmart Inc, which gets about half of its revenue from low-margin groceries, took a more cautious stance on margin recovery on Thursday even as it raised its annual sales and profit targets.""Stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said.While its U.S. margins fell 41 basis points in the first quarter, it was an improvement on the 112-basis point decline in the fourth quarter.Walmart said total inventory in the quarter ended April fell 7% versus flat in the fourth quarter. This is in line with other retailers who are stocking more of what consumers are buying in a weak economy.Target said on Wednesday that inventory in the first quarter was 16% lower and it had doled out fewer clearance discounts.""Even today against a very challenging backdrop we're starting to assemble the building blocks for a recovery in our operating margin rate back towards its longer-term potential,"" Target CFO said.(Additional reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)]"

Cafecito con Marias Gamesa®️ aims to help bridge this gap PURCHASE, N.Y., May 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- When it comes to raising the next generation of bicultural children, Latina moms are looking for less judgment from loved ones, more support from other moms, and an occasional day off (Mother's Day doesn't count!) to help them parent with confidence. According to a new survey from the beloved Mexican cookie brand Marias Gamesa, key factors like family pressures, unrealistic societal standards, and inability to talk openly about their parenting experience have Latina moms seeking new virtual connections to those navigating similar issues. To create a new safe space for moms, Marias Gamesa is launching Cafecito con Marias Gamesa, a month-long virtual village of support providing moms with the opportunity to pause, connect and share real-life advice with each other no matter where they are.Marias Gamesa launches Cafecito con Marias Gamesa to provide moms with connection, community and space to have honest conversations on the realities of Latina motherhood.The virtual village will kick off with the Marias Gamesa Squad, a group of four Latina content creators and moms who will ignite the conversation through virtual #CafecitoConMariasGamesa social posts on TikTok and Instagram. Joined by Ana Patricia Gámez, entrepreneur, TV personality, mother of two, and host of popular podcast Sin Filtro, the Marias Gamesa Squad will invite Latina moms everywhere to take a ""cafecito break"" and join in on the conversation. The Marias Gamesa Squad includes: sports reporter and podcaster Antonella Gonzalez, food enthusiast and recipe creator Alejandra Tapia, comedy content creator Maritere Castellanos Esteve, and lifestyle and fashion expert, entrepreneur and shopping expert Maria Claudia.""Gamesa is proud to launch the campaign Cafecito con Marias Gamesa to celebrate Latina moms on Mother's Day and beyond. As a brand rooted in celebrating motherhood, it felt natural to create a space where moms can connect and feel supported through the power of cafecito breaks,"" said Gustavo Cecilio, Senior Marketing Director for the Hispanic Business Unit, PepsiCo Foods North America. ""We want to encourage moms to gather and talk openly about their experiences, reminding them that they are supported by a great community. Having Marias Gamesa cookies serve as the connector for this virtual village of support is our way of honoring moms everywhere.""Story continuesThe Cafecito con Marias Gamesa campaign is a virtual twist on the long-standing tradition of ""cafecito breaks"" within the Hispanic community. During this time, friends and family come together to have an informal conversation. The rise of social media and technology has created an opportunity for Latina moms to take these breaks into a virtual setting and gather other perspectives beyond their immediate circle. Ana Patricia Gámez and the Marias Gamesa Squad will honor this tradition in a virtual setting using #CafecitoConMariasGamesa to discuss topics such as parenting, self-care, seeking support, cultural traditions, and more across their social channels. They will also join Ana Patricia Gámez's podcast Sin Filtro as guests to continue the conversation.""I'm excited to partner with Marias Gamesa to launch Cafecito con Marias Gamesa. Being a mom raising a bicultural family in the U.S. comes with a unique set of challenges and opportunities,"" said Gámez. ""It's important for moms to know that they're not alone in this journey and that their feelings are valid and shared. Through Cafecito con Marias Gamesa, we are giving Latina moms the extra dose of energy and positive affirmation that they need and deserve.""Cafecito con Marias Gamesa will cover a wide range of topics impacting Latina moms today, which are grounded in insights from the brand's recent survey. Gamesa asked 500 Latina moms about their approach to motherhood including, prioritizing self-care, seeking support and reinventing cultural traditions in a new era of parenting. Some of the key findings include:Parenting Pressures &amp; New Forms of Support Half of Latina moms feel pressure from their family about their parenting style - this pressure is felt more amongst moms aged 25-35.Three quarters of Latina moms feel that they are being held to unrealistic societal standards as moms.Just over half (52%) of these moms agree it's hard to talk about motherhood challenges with family, leading them to seek new forms of advice, such as online support, from other Latina moms facing similar issues.Preserving Culture &amp; Raising Confident Kids Moms are passing along their heritage to their children, namely through food, time spent with friends/family from a similar country, music or language.Self-acceptance and education are the most important values these moms want to pass down to their kids.Prioritizing Their own Health &amp; Happiness When asked about what self-care means to them, doing activities they love and spending time alone scored highest.However, time and money are the biggest barriers to fulfilling these self-care moments for Latina moms.These findings and more will be explored during Ana Patricia Gámez's Sin Filtro podcast in the coming weeks. Fans are invited to join in the conversation on social media using #CafecitoConMariasGamesa to share their own motherhood stories and join the virtual village of support for moms, by moms.For more information about Marias Gamesa, please visit www.gamesacookies.com.ABOUT GAMESA®Gamesa is Mexico's largest manufacturer of cookies.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Pohlad, sold US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$174 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$192, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 6.6% of Robert Pohlad's stake.In the last year PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At PepsiCo Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PepsiCo. Specifically, insiders ditched US$16m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PepsiCoAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$350m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At PepsiCo Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought PepsiCo stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 5 warning signs for PepsiCo (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in PEP?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $7.30.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: REGN) applauds the United States Supreme Court’s unanimous opinion1 ending a nearly decade-long patent dispute related to the Regeneron-invented PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent® (alirocumab). The decision affirms the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s opinion, which held that Amgen’s asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims were invalid.This ruling validates Regeneron’s longstanding position on this matter and represents an unequivocal win for America’s innovation economy, its scientists, and researchers. Most importantly, it is a win for patients who rely on the lifesaving discoveries made through years of research and investment by the biopharma community. The justices rejected an attempt to radically change the longstanding legal standard for patent validity under the enablement doctrine – a move that would have blocked progress for entire classes of molecules, deterred innovative competition, and led to potential increases of drug prices.“Bringing innovative new therapies to patients is the core mission of Regeneron, and we were proud to deliver Praluent as the first FDA approved PCKS9 inhibitor,” said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Regeneron. “This Supreme Court decision protects access to this medicine and defends our industry and others against overreaching patent claims that cover an entire therapeutic category and could have a chilling effect on bringing life-saving medicines to people in need.”“This decision affirms the longstanding law on enablement and functional claiming, such that you need to enable the full scope of the claims without unreasonable experimentation,” said Joseph J. LaRosa, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Regeneron. “We’re gratified that the Supreme Court has affirmed the position we have held for nearly ten years that Amgen’s PCSK9 patents were overly broad and inconsistent with established case law.”Story continuesWe thank the Justices for their consideration of this matter and the many groups, individuals and the U.S. government who supported our defense of scientific innovation.About Regeneron Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

At issue was whether a valid patent can cover all the members of an identified group, or if it is limited to only those members of the group specified by the patent owner.In 2014, Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron for patent infringement over their rival drug Praluent, which works by a similar mechanism as Repatha. Both drugs use laboratory-made antibodies to block a protein called PCSK9 that inhibits the removal of bad cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve this result through different chemical combinations.Bad cholesterol, known LDL, can cause a buildup of plaque in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.Amgen sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of Repatha worldwide in 2022. Regeneron sold $130 million worth of Praluent in the United States last year, and Sanofi sold more than $400 million worth in the rest of the world.Story continuesJoseph LaRosa, executive vice president at Regeneron, welcomed the ruling.""We're gratified that the Supreme Court has affirmed the position we have held for nearly 10 years that Amgen's PCSK9 patents were overly broad and inconsistent with established case law,"" LaRosa said.An Amgen spokesperson expressed disappointment with the court's ruling and said the company ""will continue to fight for patent laws and policies"" that protect innovation.The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals nationwide, invalidated Amgen's patents that covered PCSK9-blocking drugs as a group. The Federal Circuit in 2021 ruled that Amgen's patents granted by the U.S. government lacked the kind of detailed guidelines needed to replicate the full scope of its claims without ""undue experimentation.""Under U.S. law, a drug patent must allow a skilled scientist to replicate an invention without excessive trial and error.Amgen had asked the justices to find that the Federal Circuit wrongly applied too high a legal bar by demanding that a patent explain how to make virtually every possible version of the invention that could perform the claimed functions. It argued that a patent need only to ""enable skilled artisans to 'make and use' the invention,"" not account for the full range of possible forms the invention might take.The justices said that Supreme Court precedent weighed against Amgen.""For if our cases teach anything,"" Gorsuch wrote, ""it is that the more a party claims, the broader the monopoly it demands, the more it must enable.""During arguments in the case in March, Amgen faced tough questions from the justices about why its patents described 26 specific examples of antibodies when the scope of its patents would cover a larger number.Sanofi urged the justices to affirm the Federal Circuit's ruling, characterizing Amgen's bid as ""a blatant attempt to corner the market"" for cholesterol-lowering drugs.President Joe Biden's administration, arguing in support of Sanofi, told the justices that Amgen had not disclosed the information needed to make to make its patents valid.(Reporting by John Kruzel; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

(The data does not differentiate between prescription medicine and illegal drug use.)""This historic rise seems to correspond with sharp increases in positivity for marijuana in both pre-employment and post-accident drug tests, suggesting that changing societal attitudes about marijuana may be impacting workplace behaviors and putting colleagues at risk,"" said Keith Ward, general manager and vice president for employer solutions at Quest Diagnostics in a statement. ""The increase in amphetamines positivity is also notable, given the addictive potential and health risks associated with this class of drugs.""When tests took place after workplace accidents, the positivity rate of marijuana usage jumped to 7.3%, compared to 6.7% in 2021The combined positive rate for all drugs stayed steady at 4.6%, once again tying the highest rate since 2001—and 30% above the record low, which took place from 2010-2012.

The new peak follows a steady increase in post-accident marijuana positivity every year from 2012 to 2022. In that 10-year time frame, post-accident marijuana positivity increased 204.2%. From 2002 to 2009, post-accident marijuana workforce positivity declined.These increases in post-accident marijuana positivity correspond with legalization of marijuana in certain states. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Since then, 19 additional states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of marijuana and 38 states (plus the District of Columbia) have legalized medical use, although either kind of use remains illegal under federal law.""Intoxicating cannabis products, including marijuana, can have a major impact on safety at work and have been proven to slow reaction time, impact memory and impair skills essential to driving. State legalization of the drug creates new challenges for employers,"" said Katie Mueller, a senior program manager at the National Safety Council focusing on cannabis safety. ""The Quest data provide compelling evidence that increased use of cannabis products by employees can contribute to greater risk for injuries in the workplace. It is imperative employers take the proper steps to create and maintain a policy that addresses cannabis use, build a safety-focused culture and educate the workforce to keep all workers safe on and off the job.""Story continuesIn 2022, the combined U.S. workforce urine drug positivity for all drugs persisted at 4.6% – the highest level in two decades. The 2021 and 2022 positivity rates were the highest since 2001, up more than 30% from an all-time low in 2010-2012.While marijuana was the main driver of workforce positivity increases in the general U.S. workforce, amphetamines positivity also contributed to the increase. Positivity for marijuana in the general U.S. workforce increased 10.3% (4.3% positivity in 2022 versus 3.9% positivity in 2021) and amphetamines positivity increased 15.4% (1.5% positivity in 2022 versus 1.3% positivity in 2021). While the company's amphetamines data does not differentiate between prescribed medications and illicit drug use, the increase correlates with other data suggesting that the use of amphetamines, prescribed or illicit, has grown in recent years in the U.S.The rising overall drug positivity rate for general workforce urine testing was observed widely across U.S. industries. Over the past five years, the workforce positivity rate climbed in most industry sectors, led by Accommodation and Food Services increasing 42.9% (4.9% in 2018 versus 7.0% in 2022), Retail Trade increasing 42.6% (5.4% in 2018 versus 7.7% in 2022), and Finance and Insurance increasing 38.5% (2.6% in 2018 versus 3.6% in 2022).""Our 2022 Quest Diagnostics analysis shows that the overall U.S. workforce positivity rate continued to be at a historically elevated level in 2022, even as much of the nation's workforce returned to the office post-pandemic,"" said Keith Ward, General Manager and Vice President for Employer Solutions at Quest Diagnostics. ""This historic rise seems to correspond with sharp increases in positivity for marijuana in both pre-employment and post-accident drug tests, suggesting that changing societal attitudes about marijuana may be impacting workplace behaviors and putting colleagues at risk. The increase in amphetamines positivity is also notable, given the addictive potential and health risks associated with this class of drugs.""""Year-over-year and five-year data point to continuously higher workforce drug positivity overall, by industry, and across multiple drug categories,"" said Suhash Harwani, PhD, Senior Director of Science for Employer Solutions at Quest Diagnostics. ""As employers express concern for employee health, wellness and safety, they may want to consider these data as a warning sign, particularly as a growing body of science demonstrates the risks of marijuana to mental and physical health.""The new Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index™ (DTI) report is based on more than 10.6 million deidentified urine, hair and oral-fluid drug test results reported between January and December 2022, aimed at providing insight into behavior seen in workers across the combined U.S. workforce by industry and drug type. The combined U.S. workforce includes the general U.S. workforce of mostly company-policy testing by private employers as well as the federally mandated, safety-sensitive workforce, which includes federal employees and the transportation and nuclear power industries, and can include workers such as pilots, truck drivers, train conductors and others required to drug test under federal legislation.The new findings will be presented at the National Drug &amp; Alcohol Screening Association (NDASA) 2023 Conference taking place May 23-25 in Bellevue, WA.Marijuana positivity in states that permit recreational and medical use continued to climbIn the general U.S. workforce, marijuana positivity increased 10.3% year over year (3.9% in 2021 versus 4.3% in 2022). Marijuana positivity increased 11.8% (5.1% in 2021 versus 5.7% in 2022) in states in which recreational marijuana is legal and 8.3% (3.6% in 2021 versus 3.9% in 2022) in states in which medical marijuana is legal. In states in which neither recreational nor medical marijuana is legal, marijuana positivity increased 3.3% (3.0% in 2021 versus 3.1% in 2022) year over year and 14.8% over five years (2.7% in 2018 versus 3.1% in 2022).In the federally mandated safety-sensitive workforce, marijuana positivity increased nationally 14% year over year (0.86% in 2021 versus 0.98% in 2022). Marijuana positivity increased 17% (0.94% in 2021 versus 1.1% in 2022) in states in which recreational marijuana is legal. Marijuana positivity increased 5.9% (0.85% in 2021 versus 0.90% in 2022) in states in which medical marijuana is legal. In states in which neither recreational nor medical use marijuana is legal, marijuana positivity increased 12.7% (0.79% in 2021 versus 0.89% in 2022) year over year and 1.1% over five years (0.88% in 2018 versus 0.89% in 2022).""In the general U.S. workforce, states that have legalized recreational and medical marijuana use exhibit higher positivity rates than the national average. States that have not legalized marijuana appear to have positivity rates below the national averages,"" said Dr. Harwani. ""Overall, post-accident and pre-employment positivity test rates among the federally mandated, safety-sensitive population have always been lower, suggesting the expectation of testing may be a deterrent.""Urine positivity rates for post-accident testing increased over five yearsThe rise in marijuana post-accident positivity among private employers mirrored an increase in overall drug positivity in individuals tested post-accident. In the general U.S. workforce, rates of post-accident drug positivity increased both year over year and over the past five years in nearly all specimen types tested. Over the last five years, in general workforce urine testing, overall post-accident positivity increased 22.6% (8.4% in 2018 versus 10.3% in 2022). Specifically, post-accident positivity as compared to pre-employment tests in urine specimens tested for marijuana and cocaine in the general U.S. workforce was higher by 58.7% and 230%, respectively.Additionally, post-accident urine positivity for marijuana among the federally mandated safety-sensitive population increased year over year by 16.7% (1.8% in 2021 versus 2.1% in 2022) and over five years by 40% (1.5% in 2018 versus 2.1% in 2022). Pre-employment positivity for marijuana also increased 18.2% for this group (1.1% in 2021 versus 1.3% in 2022) and 30% over five years (1.0% in 2018 versus 1.3% in 2022).Post-accident testing is conducted to evaluate whether drug use may have played a role in a workplace incident prompting the drug test. Both post-accident and pre-employment drug testing aim to protect non-drug using workers from others who may use drugs in the workplace and pose a danger.U.S. workforce positivity plateaued at 20-year highThe overall positivity rate in the combined U.S. workforce, based on more than nine million urine drug tests, was 4.6% in 2022 and 2021, an increase of 31.4% from the all-time low of 3.5% just 11 years ago (2010-2012). In the general U.S. workforce, positivity increased 1.8% (5.6% in 2021 versus 5.7% in 2022) and was 11.8% higher than in 2018 (5.1% in 2018 versus 5.7% in 2021).Overall positivity in the federally mandated, safety-sensitive workforce based on more than 2.9 million urine drug tests climbed 9.1% year over year (2.2% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2022). While the positivity rate dropped 11.1% since 2018 (2.7% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2022), 2018 marked the introduction of testing for certain prescription opioids. Positivity rates based on urine drug tests in certain drug categories for the federally mandated, safety-sensitive workforce increased in 2022. Of note, marijuana increased 14% (0.86% in 2021 to 0.98% in 2022) and amphetamines increased 8.7% (0.69% in 2021 to 0.75% in 2022).""Safety-sensitive jobs, like pilots and some federal positions, carry responsibilities that have higher potential risk of harm to public safety than most private-sector jobs,"" said Dr. Harwani. ""Employers need help identifying individuals who are capable, competent and fully focused to perform their duties – and it is discouraging to see such a steep increase in drug positivity for workers in safety-sensitive roles.""Positivity for marijuana continued upward climb in the general U.S. workforcePositivity rates for marijuana in the general U.S. workforce, based on more than 6.3 million urine tests, continued an upward climb, increasing 10.3% (3.9% in 2021 versus 4.3% in 2022), the highest positivity rate ever reported in the DTI, and 53.6% over the past five years (2.8% in 2018).Increase in 5-year positivity in every industry; 9 of 15 increased year over year Year-over-year positivity based on urine drug tests among the general workforce increased in 9 of 15 industries reported (industries are based on the North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments). Positivity in Health Care and Social Assistance increased year over year by 3.9% (5.1% in 2021 versus 5.3% in 2022) and by 14.3% in Public Administration (3.5% in 2021 versus 4.0% in 2022).Over five years, workforce positivity increased in every industry category. Accommodation and Food Services led the way with a 42.9% increase in positivity (4.9% in 2018 versus 7.0% in 2022). Retail Trade positivity was close behind at 42.6% increase (5.4% in 2018 versus 7.7% in 2022). Positivity in Finance and Insurance increased 38.5% (2.6% in 2018 versus 3.6% in 2022). Positivity in Transportation and Warehousing increased 35.9% (3.9% in 2018 versus 5.3% in 2022). Construction increased 14.6% (4.1% in 2018 versus 4.7% in 2022). Manufacturing increased 21.6% (3.7% in 2018 versus 4.5% in 2022).Marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines showed widespread increases across industry sectorsMarijuana positivity was highest in Retail Trade and Accommodation and Food Services, at 8.1% in 2022. Over five years, marijuana positivity in Retail Trade increased 131.4% (from 3.5% in 2018 versus 8.1% in 2022). Marijuana positivity in Accommodation and Food Services increased 102.5% (from 4.0% in 2018 versus 8.1% in 2022). Cocaine positivity increased in 12 of 15 industries year over year and was highest in construction at 0.33%. Amphetamines positivity increased 15.4%, driven by increases in 14 of 15 industries, and was highest in Education Services, at 2.1%.Cocaine positivity was mixed in the general U.S. workforcePositivity for cocaine based on urine tests in the general U.S. workforce ticked up 4.8% (0.21% in 2021 versus 0.22% in 2022) and positivity for cocaine over the past five years declined 21.4% (0.28% in 2018 versus 0.22% in 2022). Positivity rates for cocaine based on urine tests in the federally mandated safety-sensitive workforce stayed even (0.21% in 2021 and 2022) and were down 25% over five years (0.28% in 2018 versus 0.22% in 2022).Positivity for 6-AM (heroin) in all urine drug tests decreased over five yearsPositivity for 6-AM metabolite (heroin) in the general U.S. workforce decreased 53.8% (0.013% in 2021 versus 0.006% in 2022) and 80% over five years (0.03% in 2018 versus 0.006% in 2022). Positivity for the 6-AM metabolite (heroin) in the federally mandated, safety-sensitive workforce decreased 40% (0.005% in 2021 versus 0.003% in 2022) and 76.9% over five years (0.013% in 2018 versus 0.003% in 2022).About the Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index™ The Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index™ (DTI) is a series of reports that provide insights into trends in workforce drug use based on positivity rates of deidentified laboratory tests performed by Quest Diagnostics for a range of illicit, legal and prescription drugs. It examines test results according to three categories of workers: federally mandated, safety-sensitive workers; the general U.S. workforce; and the combined U.S. workforce. Federally mandated, safety-sensitive workers include pilots, bus and truck drivers, and workers in nuclear power plants, for whom routine drug testing is mandated by government agencies like the Department of Transportation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Defense.The strengths of the DTI analysis include its large, nationally representative sample size, longitudinal monitoring, a testing population that is generally reflective of the U.S. workforce and the quality of the company's drug testing services to confirm positive results. Limitations include analysis only of employers that perform drug testing with the company, and a lack of exact cross-specimen comparisons due to variations in substances for which employers test. Quest Diagnostics has analyzed annual workplace drug testing data since 1988 and publishes the findings as a public service.Quest Diagnostics is the leading workforce drug testing provider, offering a broad range of drug testing options that allow employers to combine and customize a drug testing program that meets their unique business needs, all from a single, convenient provider.

308,f2d29e6a-a8e2-3037-8419-2e90fd7b875c,GPS,2023-05-19,Gap (GPS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-gps-expected-beat-earnings-140002894.html,1684418402,STORY,"['AEO', 'GPS']","[Gap (GPS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis clothing chain is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +61.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.29 billion, down 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.74% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gap?For Gap, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.48%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Gap will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gap would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.75, delivering a surprise of -27.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Gap appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.17 per share for the quarter ended April 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.06 billion, up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for American Eagle has been revised 1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 9.81%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that American Eagle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They were down early-- down more earlier. Orders, the company said, fell 23% in the third quarter. They blamed a large backlog of products and lower demand from customers.Cisco did forecast modest revenue growth in 2024. So it's that sort of push and pull that seems to be affecting the shares here. The sales forecast was above estimates, that order growth-- or the order decline in the last quarter, so that's the sort of balance, if you will, in this environment.And Chuck Robbins, the CEO, did say demand is staying steady. He says, ""An earlier increase in product shipments meant customers needed to absorb these shipments,"" right? So you're seeing sort of the disruptions in ordering that we've seen in a lot of companies.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and for anybody looking through an earnings report or even listening into a call like Cisco's, you'll often hear about what there ARR is, that Annualized Recurring Revenue, or even some of the RPO and their Remaining Performance Obligations. Remaining performance obligations essentially give them kind of this pipeline that they can deliver on. And that total short-term obligation grew to $16.9 billion.Total product orders, as you mentioned, were down, actually. That was a little bit of a hit by about 23%, driven by a few of the factors, including macroeconomic, that Chuck had pointed out earlier in the call, essentially saying that global customer advisory and the board that they were able to meet with earlier in the month, they're still investing in key technologies. They're still trying to grow out that portfolio base.But they're also moving towards more of a solution services or subscription-based revenue kind of pie here, if you think about it. And so 82% of their software revenues were subscription-based, and that's where they can perhaps lock in a little bit more recurring revenue, which is what investors might start to give a little bit more weight to in terms of a metric that they look at when they do hear of any of the Cisco Business updates or quarterly earnings reports.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Right. I guess judging from the stock reaction, it seems like they are sort of buying that narrative--BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it seems so.JULIE HYMAN: --that it's not worse.BRAD SMITH: Not worse, yeah.]"
