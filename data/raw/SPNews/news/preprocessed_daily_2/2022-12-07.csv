They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab. FNDX has been able to amass assets over $10.04 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for FNDX, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesThe fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 15.40% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.39% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 19.55% of FNDX's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -6.22% and is down about -1.84% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 12/07/2022), respectively. FNDX has traded between $47.76 and $59.90 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25.34% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 729 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $54.15 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $105.24 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,7e3cfeca-206c-36c5-95a3-76136a01c872,SCHW,2022-12-07,Is Schwab 1000 Index (SNXFX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-1000-index-snxfx-strong-120012027.html,1670328012,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Looking for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? You may want to consider Schwab 1000 Index (SNXFX) as a possible option. SNXFX has no Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, but we have been able to look into other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is responsible for SNXFX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. Since Schwab 1000 Index made its debut in April of 1991, SNXFX has garnered more than $12.52 billion in assets. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 9.97%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 9.65%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 20.84%, the standard deviation of SNXFX over the past three years is 21.25%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 18.76% compared to the category average of 18.55%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.02, which means it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. SNXFX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -0.52, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsExamining the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.As of the last filing date, the mutual fund has 99.54% of its assets in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $269.72 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyFinanceRetail TradeWith turnover at about 0%, this fund is making fewer trades than comparable funds.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SNXFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.78%. SNXFX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineThis could just be the start of your research on SNXFXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

3,8b31f6f2-b253-3d33-901e-78710de79acb,RRC,2022-12-07,Titan Machinery and GIII Apparel have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/titan-machinery-giii-apparel-highlighted-135001591.html,1670334601,STORY,"['TITN', 'CRK', 'EQT', 'RRC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 6, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Titan Machinery TITN as the Bull of the Day and GIII Apparel Group GIII asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Range Resources RRC, EQT Corp. EQT and Comstock Resources CRK.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:The market is starting to butt its head against some resistance here. As sellers enter, there are some stocks that are really taking a punch. How do you know if your stocks are going to ever turn around? Like somebody asked me earlier today, which dip is the one to buy?One way to gain more confidence is by adding stocks which have strong earnings trends. While stock prices are among the most fickle things on Earth, earnings tend to trend more consistently. Find a stock with a powerful earnings trend and you’ll have a winner in the long-run, regardless of short-term pressures the market should hand you. It’s a great way to sleep at night.The Zacks Rank uncovers these stocks for you. That’s why I have Titan Machinery as my Bull of the Day. Titan Machinery Inc. owns and operates a network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment stores in the United States and Europe. It operates through three segments: Agriculture, Construction, and International.The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is analysts coming out and increasing their earnings estimates for both the current year and next year. Over the last quarter, current year Zacks Consensus Estimate is up from $3.52 to $4.38 while next year’s number is up from $3.79 to $4.35. That is partly due to analysts playing a bit of catchup. Over the last year, the company has beat earnings expectations by an average of 44 cents each quarter. The last time the company missed earnings was November 2019.Bear of the Day:When the market ripped higher from the October lows to the 200-day moving average, investors cheered. It had that feeling again where everything was going one way, up. Over the last few trading days, sellers have had the upper hand, and it is making for some ugly downside action in some individual names.Story continuesDon’t get caught holding the bag in a stock made of straw. The real winners of the long-term in the stock market are companies with the strongest earnings trends. Those weak hands get shaken out real quick in stocks that are struggling to deliver these earnings.The Zacks Rank helps warn investors of weakening earnings trends. Stocks like today’s Bear of the Day GIII Apparel Group. G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. designs, sources, and markets women's and men's apparel in the United States and internationally. The company operates through two segments, Wholesale Operations and Retail Operations. Its products include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women's suits, and women's performance wear; and women's handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories, and luggage.A big earnings miss here caused some bad fallout. Last quarter’s report came in 50-cents shy of expectations. It was the second miss in a row, prompting analysts to cut their numbers for both the current year and next year. That dropped the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $4.31 to $3.30 while next year’s is off from $4.89 to $3.63.The Textile – Apparel industry is in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:U.S. Natural Gas: Analysis of EIA's Weekly InventoryThe U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures plunged more than 14% week over week.Despite this, the market has been kind to natural gas in 2022, with the commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $10 for the first time since 2008. Natural gas stocks like Range Resources, EQT Corp. and Comstock Resources have been some of the prime beneficiaries of the price appreciation.EIA Reports a Withdrawal Smaller Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 81 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the holiday-shortened week ended Nov 25, below the guidance of 88 Bcf decline per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.However, the decrease was above last year’s pull of 54 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net shrinkage of 34 Bcf.The second draw of the winter heating season puts total natural gas stocks at 3,483 Bcf, which is 89 Bcf (2.5%) below the 2021 level at this time and 86 Bcf (2.4%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 106.4 Bcf per day, down 0.6 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to lower shipments from Canada, partly offset by an increase in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption slumped 13.7% to 108.6 Bcf from 125.9 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a weaker power burn and decreased residential/commercial demand on the back of above-normal temperatures.Natural Gas Logs a Big Weekly LossNatural gas prices tumbled last week, following the lower-than-expected inventory draw. Futures for January delivery ended Friday at $6.281 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 14.3% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization — for the first time in four weeks — is also the result of forecasts for milder weather and the extended shutdown of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. The latest models anticipate tepid temperature-driven consumption over the near term (with less extensive use of heaters across homes and businesses), which is a negative for prices.The one thing supporting natural gas is a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere.Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means that LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with squeezed natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe, following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out some of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart by the end of December after several missed target dates. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Final ThoughtsDespite some hiccups in between, the natural gas market is still up almost 70% so far this year. While fundamental indicators continue to suggest strong price levels, the natural gas market is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, EQT and Comstock Resources.Range Resources: The upstream firm has a strong footing in the prolific Appalachian Basin. In the gas-rich resource, RRC has huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.Range Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of 151.5% for the current year. Valued at around $6.5 billion, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported EPS of $1.37 for the third quarter, reflecting a 0.7% surprise over consensus. RRC shares have climbed 45.2% in a year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with the primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 348.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EQT’s 2022 earnings has been revised 2.5% upward over the past 90 days. EQT — valued at around $14.7 billion — has soared 104% this year.Comstock Resources: The company is active in the Haynesville shale in North Louisiana and East Texas — a premier natural gas basin. As of now, CRK has a projected earnings growth rate of 218.1% for the current year.Comstock Resources, with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, enjoys a Zacks Value, Growth and Momentum Style Score of A each, and an overall VGM Score of A. CRK shares have surged 117.6% so far this year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.44%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.2%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the steel company had gained 12.43% over the past month. This has outpaced the Basic Materials sector's gain of 9.86% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.22% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nucor as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Nucor to post earnings of $5.68 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 28.73%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.39 billion, down 19.03% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $29.49 per share and revenue of $40.94 billion, which would represent changes of +27.33% and +12.21%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nucor should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Nucor is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Nucor's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 5.12.

ARE announced a 2.5% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 cash dividend payout. Delighting its shareholders, the company will now pay out a dividend of $1.21 per share, up from the $1.18 paid in the third quarter. The increased dividend will be paid out on Jan 13, 2023 to shareholders on record as of Dec 30, 2022.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $4.84 per share. This results in an annualized yield of about 3.2%, considering Alexandria’s closing price of $150.58 on Dec 5. For the year ending Dec 31, 2022, the common stock dividend marks an increase of 24 cents or 5% year over year.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust investors, and Alexandria remains committed to that. It has increased its dividend 11 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 6.11%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check Alexandria’s dividend history here.Can Alexandria Maintain Its Payout?Alexandria operates its business in highly concentrated urban campuses, which have high barriers to entry and a limited supply of available space. It focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for life science and technology entities.In the third quarter of 2022, investment-grade or publicly-traded large-cap tenants accounted for 49% of annual rental revenues in effect. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all tenants is 7.2 years. For Alexandria’s top 20 tenants, it is 9.7 years. This ensures steady rental revenues for ARE.The high demand for Class A properties in AAA locations is boosting the level of occupancy and driving growth in rents. The company is witnessing strong demand for space in key life science markets.The occupancy of operating properties in North America remained high at 94.3% as of Sep 30, 2022. Excluding vacancies at the recently acquired properties, the occupancy was 98.4%. Such a high level of occupancy is anticipated to continue in the upcoming quarters as well and support rent growth.Moreover, Alexandria has adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. The company had $6.4 billion of liquidity as of the end of the third quarter. It has no debt maturities before 2025. The weighted-average remaining term of debt as of Sep 30, 2022 was 13.2 years.For the 10-year period ending Dec 31, 2022, Alexandria estimates a total of $2.0 billion in cash flows from operating activities after dividends will have been generated for reinvestment.Moreover, Alexandria’s current payout ratio is 56.49%, lower than the industry’s average of 66.29%. Looking at the company’s solid operating platform, balance sheet strength, ability to generate cash flows and payout ratio, it is likely to be able to sustain the hiked dividend.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 7.4% so far in the quarter, marginally underperforming the industry’s growth of 7.7%.

This amount is in addition to the recently completed fourth quarter common share repurchases of $1.0 billion. The company now intends to repurchase up to a total of $1.5 billion of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2022.""Our plans for additional common share repurchases of up to $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, coupled with the recently completed repurchases of $1.0 billion earlier this quarter, underscores the strength of the firm’s capital position and our confidence in our organic growth trajectory. We recognize the priority our shareholders place on capital return, and we continue to expect to use dividends and share repurchases to return significantly more capital than our medium term target payout of 80% of earnings in 2023,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ron O’Hanley.Stock purchases under State Street’s common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs.

The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time. The continuing of State Street’s common share repurchase program in 2023, and all dividends on State Street’s common stock, are subject to approval by State Street’s Board of Directors.Story continuesAbout State Street CorporationState Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) is one of the world's leading providers of financial services to institutional investors including investment servicing, investment management and investment research and trading.

Corporation VFC fell 11.17% on Dec 5, 2022 on management’s commentary on lowered expectations for fiscal 2023. Yesterday, the company trimmed its outlook for fiscal 2023, driven by lower-than-expected consumer demand across its business categories, mostly in North America. The reduced demand is likely to result in a heightened promotional environment and wholesale order cancellations to manage inventory levels.V.F. Corp also notes that the reduced consumer discretionary spending in Europe due to inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related disturbances in China is expected to affect its performance in fiscal 2023. Concurrent with the slashed view, the company also announced the departure of its chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), Steve Rendle.V.F. Corp anticipates revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2023 to be slightly below the previous view, expecting a 3-4% increase in constant dollars (excluding foreign currency translations). VFC earlier predicted 5-6% revenue growth for fiscal 2023.Additionally, the company expects SG&amp;A deleverage in fiscal 2023 due to lower volumes. This, along with the promotional environment in North America, is likely to weigh on profitability.V.F. Corp anticipates fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be $2.00-$2.20 per share compared with the $3.18 reported in fiscal 2022 and $2.40-$2.50 expected earlier.However, the company stated that its long-term targets for fiscal 2027 and the capital allocation plan, as provided on Sep 28, 2022, remain intact. V.F. Corp has been on track with the execution of its strategy, vying to deliver on its long-term targets of strong shareholder value while improving near-term performance.V.F. Corp’s five-year growth plan (for fiscal 2023-2027) targets revenue growth in the mid-to-high-single digits on a five-year CAGR basis. The bottom line is predicted to rise at a five-year CAGR of high single to low double digits.The operating margin is envisioned to be 15% by fiscal 2027, driven by gross margin expansion and reduced SG&amp;A. Management also noted that it would return roughly $7 billion via dividends and share repurchases by fiscal 2027. Free cash flow is forecast at $5.5 billion.Following the departure of Steve Rendle, the company appointed Benno Dore as the interim president and CEO, effective immediately. Meanwhile, Richard Carucci has been selected to serve as the interim chairman of the board.Story continuesThings You Should KnowThe V.F. Corp stock has declined 61.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.9%. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock also compared unfavorably with the Consumer Discretionary and the S&amp;P 500’s declines of 33.1% and 14.6%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock’s dismal run on the bourses can be attributed to the continued bleak performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. VFC has been struggling with a tough operating environment, including pandemic-related disruptions in China, macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds and near-term challenges at Vans.V.F. Corp is also witnessing elevated SG&amp;A costs and elevated freight expenses related to COVID-19 headwinds. SG&amp;A expenses grew 7.8% to $1,251.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, following 11.5% in the fiscal first quarter.However, VFC’s brand portfolio and strength in the outdoor, active, streetwear and workwear units remain tailwinds. Also, growth in the EMEA and Americas regions acted as major growth drivers.Stocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Crocs CROX, PVH Corp PVH and lululemon athletica LULU.Crocs is one of the leading footwear brands, with its focus on comfort and style.

12,470609b0-d69e-35a4-8f40-01abde81fb40,JWN,2022-12-07,What Nordstrom Will Focus On in 2023,WWD,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/470609b0-d69e-35a4-8f40-01abde81fb40/what-nordstrom-will-focus-on.html,1670358112,STORY,['JWN'],"[For Nordstrom Inc., high on the agenda for 2023 is starting with clean inventories, improving Rack, and elevating the customer experience.“As we look to 2023, there’s a lot of uncertainty. There’s certainly macroeconomic factors that for a shoe salesman like myself is hard to predict. So what’s our response to that? It’s really to be as agile as possible and for us, that really started in earnest coming out of Q2,” said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of the family-run Nordstrom Inc. business.More from WWDNordstrom NYFW Dinner hosted by Shalom Harlow, Tonne Goodman and Rickie De SoleBrooklyn Museum Celebrates Virgil Abloh: Figures of Speech Opening6 Headlines that Captivated the Retail Industry in 2019Speaking Tuesday at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer and Retail Conference, Nordstrom called out three key focus areas for 2023. He began by discussing the Rack off-price business, indicating the goal was getting the business to produce “much more sustainable, demonstrable growth results and in particular getting to 2019 run rates, which we expect by the end of the year. It will really take optimizing our inventory,” involving having a larger proportion of the inventory represented by the same premium brands sold at Nordstrom department stores and on Nordstrom.com.“We see that happening over the course of the first half of the year,” predicted Nordstrom. At the beginning of 2022, the Seattle-based company started “simplifying Rack’s focus to great brands at great prices,” Nordstrom said.“When we talk about great brands, it’s mostly about brands we carry in our Nordstrom banner. Ninety percent of our top brands in the Nordstrom banner are represented in our Rack business. Many of those brands do not show up in the off-price channel. Our mix is unique. And really the reason customers come to Nordstrom Rack is to find the premium brands they see in our Nordstrom banner. That’s kind of a two-step process. One is obviously getting more of those brands. As brands have had more availability, we’ve been increasing the percentage of our buys on those brands.Story continues“The second piece is in clearing out the less productive inventory we’ve had…We’ve seen a softening of demand for clearance. So there’s always clearance. There’s always less productive parts of inventory. Clearing that out has [required] more markdowns and has been slower than normal.”Nordstrom is intent on entering 2023 with clean inventories, as are many retailers that this year find themselves with bloated levels of merchandise. “We’ve had some inventory to clear out. We are on pace to do that, to round the corner and enter 2023 clean. That’s vital for us,” said the CEO.Erik NordstromHe stressed being responsive to “these more uncertain times, to the greater volatility, and to increase our agility, not only entering [2023] clean but to plan for faster turns and to be more positioned to chase the business and really invest into what the customer is responding to.” It’s about putting enough open-to-buy dollars aside, to be able to quickly jump on emerging trends.“I think the biggest change over the last couple of years is the volatility, is the need for agility. That’s just more important,” said Nordstrom.He also called out the supply chain, where the company will “continue to build better customer experiences by providing faster, more consistent deliveries and continue to leverage expenses there.”Another priority is introducing brands to customers. “We really need to differentiate ourselves in the discovery part,” said Nordstrom. “We are really good at exposing customers to new brands and introducing those new brands to customers. And customers come to us less so for price promotions, and [more so] for newness.“In particular, a sweet spot for us is not necessarily launching new brands, but brands that are early stage and hitting their growth” stride. “That’s where we can really help them scale,” Nordstrom said.On Running, Spirit of God, and Allbirds “are in our top five fastest-growing brands. They’re different brands” generating real interest from customers, and with limited distribution, Nordstrom said.Regarding business trends, Nordstrom said that beginning in late June, “we have seen signs of customer pullback, but it is most pronounced at the lower income levels,” which is more the Rack customer.“We still see customers responding to newness and responding to our higher-ticket items,” whether that’s at the Nordstrom banner or at Rack. “What the common thread there, for us, is newness and to bring in a flow of really desirable product. Designer has in the last several years been our strongest merchandise category. There’s still real strength there.” Nordstrom also cited “continued strength” in dressier categories for work, going out and traveling.“So there is strain. I think customers are being more selective — a little more careful in their purchasing,” Nordstrom observed. “And again, there is correlation with income levels, but it’s not the case where across the board customers are breaking down.“The change in category performance over the last 18 months has been unlike anything I’ve seen,” Nordstrom said. “You think of the categories that were hot during the pandemic, home and active wear and everyone’s wearing yoga pants and slippers, and we sold a lot of that stuff. We didn’t sell many men’s suits or high-heel shoes during that time. That shifted. And I think you’ve seen excess supply of a lot of those pandemic-hot categories in the industry that people are looking to clear through.“It feels like that those shifts, those quick shifts, are kind of here to stay.”Regarding the holiday season so far, Michael W. Maher, Nordstrom’s senior vice president, chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer, said the company expects holiday sales and customer demand to build “consistent with what we used to see pre-pandemic — really accelerating as you get closer to Christmas. And that the level of promotional intensity would be consistent with what we saw late October, early November.“At this point, we’re seeing the demand build a little bit slower and the promotional intensity is a little bit higher than what we saw pre-pandemic levels. But I think it’s important for us to emphasize that about two thirds of our expected volume is still in front of us for the fourth quarter. So a lot is going to depend on how the next few weeks play out for us.”For holiday, “There is a sense of customers holding back,” Nordstrom explained. “Some of it is the way the calendar falls this year. There’s an extra Saturday before Christmas, Hanukkah is later. There’s some calendar reasons for holiday to be pushed back a bit. But I do think there’s something to the environment of the promotional environment where customers hold back then. We’ve seen some signs of that.“Our inventory is very current,” Nordstrom added. “The softest part of our inventory would be clearance that we’re looking to work through the system. But we feel really good about our inventory position for holiday.”Nordstrom reported top- and bottom-line declines for the third quarter ended Oct. 29, though the company managed to meet its expectations on both fronts. The third-quarter net loss was $20 million, compared to a net profit of $64 million in the year-ago period.Net sales decreased 2.9 percent to $3.43 billion, from $3.53 billion in the same period in fiscal 2021, with Nordstrom banner down 3.4 percent and Rack slipping 1.9 percent.]"

(NYSE:MMC) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesNotably, that recent sale by Óscar Fanjul Martín is the biggest insider sale of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$172, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 6.7%of Óscar Fanjul Martín's holding.In the last year Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

In total, Independent Director Óscar Fanjul Martín sold US$1.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$206m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

ON has forayed into building these products to capitalize on the uptrend in the market for vehicle electrification, ADAS, energy infrastructure and factory automation.onsemi has a very well-diversified business. The company generates a significant percentage of revenues from each of the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets. onsemi reported revenues of $2.19 billion in the last reported third quarter of 2022 which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and improved 26% on a year-over-year basis.The company is reallocating capacity to strategic and high-margin products to drive a favorable mix shift and eliminate price-to-value discrepancies. To do so, onsemi is expanding its production capacity in strategic locations and closing fab locations in areas, which are impacting its margin growth negatively due to rising price surges in operating in those areas.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Reallocating Fab locations to Reduce Costsonsemi has been expanding its silicon carbide (SiC) facilities domestically and internationally to diversify its product portfolio. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Story continuesThe company recently expanded its Hudson, NH facility, which will increase SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year. This will aid in meeting the rising demand for SiC-based solutions, which is critical for developing EVs and energy infrastructure and is an important contributor to decarbonization.ON recently expanded its SiC facility in Roznov, Czech Republic to expand SiC production capacity by 16 times. So far, ON has invested more than $150 million in the Roznov site and will be looking to spend an additional $300 million through 2023.onsemi, which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is not only expanding its production capacity. The company has recently completed the sale of its Niigata, Japan facility, which aligns with its fab liter strategy to expand gross margin and reduce fixed cost footprint. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further positively impacting onsemi’s decision to close operations in Japan is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China and Japan. Its peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The government's recent declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances. Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight, helping STM to win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicles and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.onsemi, however, signed long-term supply agreements with various customers for the next three years, which is expected to help secure $1 billion of committed SiC revenues in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recently, MCHP's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a ""golden cross.""Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.There are three stages to a golden cross. First, there must be a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out. Then, the stock's shorter moving average crosses over its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third stage is when a stock continues the upward momentum to higher prices.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.MCHP could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 16.9% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.Once investors consider MCHP's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 10 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.Moving Average Chart for MCHPWith a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on MCHP for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It may not have been easy to hold on to MCHP for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Microchip Technology's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Microchip Technology's main business drivers.Microchip Technology Inc. develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.Chandler, AZ-based, Microchip reported total revenues of $6.821 billion in fiscal 2022.Beginning from calendar year 2021, the company reports FPGA revenues combined with its licensing, memory and other or LMO segment revenues under a new revenue category referred to as “other.” The company has now three major product lines:Microcontrollers (54.4% of fiscal 2022 revenues): This product portfolio comprises 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PIC microcontrollers and 16-bit dsPIC digital signal controllers. Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new microcontrollers’ roll outs aids it in expanding customer base and sustain its leading position in the market.Analog (28%): These products consist of several families with approximately 800 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management, RF Linear drivers, safety and security, and interface products. The line of mixed-signal products primarily includes data converters that convert data from analog to digital or vice versa.Other (17.6%): The product line now comprises revenues from FPGA and LMO segments. LMO segment constitutes a combination of license fees and royalties related to SuperFlash technology, and fees for engineering services. Microchip licenses its SuperFlash technology to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners across the world.FPGA product line was primarily acquired as part of Microsemi acquisition.In fiscal 2022, Americas, Europe and Asia contributed 25.5%, 19.2% and 55.3%, respectively to net sales.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Microchip Technology, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in December 2012 would be worth $5,117.27, or a 411.73% gain, as of December 6, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 183.75% and gold's return of -0.07% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for MCHP too.Microchip is riding on consistent strength in its analog and microcontroller businesses. The company’s dominance in 8,16 and 32-bit microcontrollers is driving top-line growth. Strategic acquisitions like Microsemi and Atmel have expanded the product portfolio. It is gaining from recovery in demand across industrial, automotive and consumer end-markets, on reopening of economies, globally. Collaboration with the likes of AWS is positive. Shares have outperformed the industry year to date. Nevertheless, supply-chain constraints related to semiconductors has been a headwind. The company could not meet demand with adequate supply as shipping of products were facing increasing backlogs. Microchip expects wafer fab, as well as assembly and test constraints, will persist through 2023 and beyond. Leveraged balance sheet is a concern for investors.The stock has jumped 16.86% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Prices of both oil and gas could keep tumbling into the new year and beyond amid a plunge in demand.Dollar Tree: 5 High-Quality Items To Buy NowDiscover: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The price of U.S. oil dipped by 3.5% to a low of $74.25 a barrel on Tuesday, Dec. 6, CNN reported — it’s cheapest point since Dec. 23, 2021. Prices are down by more than 40% since hitting a high of just more than $130 a barrel in March, not long after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Prices of Brent crude, the global benchmark, declined 4% to about $79.50 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude continued to trade below $80 early Wednesday, according to OilPrice.com.Meanwhile, gasoline prices continued their months-long slide, dropping to a national average of $3.355 a gallon as of Dec. 7, according to AAA. Prices at the pump are down by 4% over the past week and 12% over the past month. They have plunged by roughly one-third since hitting an all-time high of $5.016 a gallon in mid-June.The ongoing oil selloff is probably not happy news for OPEC+, which announced on Sunday that it would continue to cut supplies by 2 million barrels a day to firm up prices. That announcement maintains a policy set in October and is expected to continue through the end of 2023.A day later, the European Union imposed a ban on seaborne oil imports from Russia, CNN noted, while Western countries put a $60 cap on Russian oil. Both of the moves aim to impair Russia’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine.It’s too early to gauge the longer-term impact of OPEC’s move on oil and gas prices, though experts expect short-term prices to remain deflated.“Gas prices are dropping sharply and are only a nickel more per gallon than a year ago,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a Monday, Dec. 5, press release. “But with oil being the main ingredient in gasoline, OPEC+’s move could slow this decline. However, the gas price will likely soon be lower than it was a year ago.”Story continuesAs previously reported by GOBankingRates, prices for other types of fuel were expected to tick higher this winter even before OPEC’s decision. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that natural gas spot prices at the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub will average $6.09 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) this winter, which would be the highest real price (adjusted for inflation) since the winter of 2009-10.Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?Explore: What Gas Prices Meant for Americans’ Wallets in 2022A separate EIA report projected that residential propane prices will rise to an average of about $3 a gallon by March 2023 from about $2.67 in late November.

Britain ended oil and oil product imports from Dec. 5. The challenges in tracking crude once it is refined and diesel once it is blended, mean some Russian diesel is likely to be delivered to and re-exported from countries such as India and Turkey, market sources said.Europe is struggling to replace up to 600,000 barrels per day of Russian supply, according to Eugene Lindell, refining and products market analyst at consultancy FGE. However, the reputational risk associated with buying Russian fuel, coupled with insurance difficulties, means only limited Russian volumes are likely to find their way into Europe, transported by small players.HOW WILL DIESEL CUSTOMS AND EXCHANGES POLICE IMPORTS?Dutch customs, who oversee the major Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp trade and storage hub, UK enforcement authorities, and the Intercontinental Exchange will check official certificates of origin for import ships. In case of doubt, UK and Dutch customs can request additional documents to help determine origin, such as contractual agreements, invoices, or bills of lading. ICE will also look at discharge certificates and proof from refiners that stock is locally refined. Participants using the U.S.-based CME group's exchanges must have their own legal advice and consult delivery terminals to ensure sanctions compliance.WHEN DOES A CHANGE OF ORIGIN OCCUR?To accept any diesel as of non-Russian origin, Britain, the European Union and the ICE require it to be substantially processed outside Russia.""Processing is regarded as substantial only if it results in the manufacture of a new product or represents an important stage in manufacture, and it takes places in an undertaking equipped for that purpose,"" the UK Government website says. Blending Russian diesel elsewhere with a non-Russian equivalent would not change its origin, while refining Russian Urals crude into diesel elsewhere would.Story continuesHOW EFFECTIVE ARE THE CHECKS?Britain, the EU and ICE consider diesel to be Russian if it is shipped and reloaded elsewhere. Britain says any processing to change the product must be done for commercial purposes, such as making a finished product to meet new UK specifications, not to avoid the sanctions regime. But is it virtually impossible to trace the origin of blended or refined diesel and difficult to track ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, meaning these aspects of the sanctions depend heavily on ""good will"", two industry sources familiar with import and tracking processes said.The volumes of STS operations between Russian-affiliated tankers have ""dramatically increased"" since February, maritime analytics company Windward said.Graphic: Ship-to-ship operations https://www.reuters.com/graphics/RUSSIA-DIESEL/EUROPE/gkvlwgydlpb/chart.png""If you were to take Russian diesel out to a more flexible port, you could blend it and issue it with a different bill of lading with a different origin,"" one of the sources, involved in the storage and transport of petroleum products, said. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.HOW WILL THIS AFFECT DIESEL FLOWS?Russian diesel is likely to be delivered to and re-exported from countries such as India and Turkey, market sources said.Russia could use its fleet to move diesel into Turkey where it can be transferred onto medium-range tankers, two industry sources said.""I would have thought that Turkey is re-exporting the barrels or perhaps substituting in-country and exporting more of their domestic output,"" lead analyst at Kpler Kevin Wright said.Graphic: Russian gasoil, diesel exports to Turkey https://www.reuters.com/graphics/RUSSIA-DIESEL/ICE/jnvwyewkmvw/chart.pngBritain, the EU and ICE consider diesel refined from Urals outside Russia to be a non-Russian product, which is likely to result in a further shift in trade flows. Europe has already started to replace Russian diesel imports with refined product from the Middle East, but analysts also expect India to refine more Urals and increase diesel exports to Europe.Graphic: Crude oil tanker port calls https://www.reuters.com/graphics/RUSSIA-DIESEL/EUROPE/znpnbeaknpl/chart.pngWHO COULD TRANSPORT RUSSIAN CARGOES?The EU price cap, which came into effect on Dec. 5, prohibits shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude, unless it is sold for less than the $60 price set by the Group of Seven nations and its allies. Many of the larger oil companies, including BP and Shell have self-imposed sanctions on Russian oil and oil products.And Russia's determination to stop selling oil to countries or companies abiding by the price cap, coupled with insurance difficulties, means ""mainstream tanker owners will be unable to lift Russian crude,"" French shipbroking firm BRS said.But smaller trading companies are already using shadow fleet tankers, several industry sources said, adding these have arranged insurance with providers in India.BRS says 111 elderly tankers have been sold to private shipping companies since February probably to transport Russian oil.European buyers are also increasingly receiving Russian diesel under the Delivered Ex-ship Incoterms rule, which leaves the responsibility for insurance in the hands of the supplier, an industry source said.HOW WILL THE SHIFT IN TRADE FLOWS AFFECT DIESEL PRICES?Dutch cooperative Rabobank expects this ""flux of a global rerouting"" to result in higher logistical costs, tighter tanker supply, and ultimately higher prices of imported energy products. ""There is a 35-45 million barrel global deficit in middle distillates,"" Rabobank said. ""This structural problem is going to last years.""(Reporting by Rowena Edwards, additional reporting by Ron Bousso in London and Toby Sterling in Amsterdam; editing by Barbara Lewis)]"

Continued tensions could send prices soaring if Russia can't find enough ""dark ships"" — vessels that turn off tracking devices — to export crude covertly.Another key factor damping market sentiment is the resilient US economy, as it's raising questions about whether the Fed would actually ease its aggressive interest rate hikes to curb inflation.Market concerns about economic growth and demand for crude could spur OPEC to follow through with oil production cuts in the future, Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at online trading platform IG, wrote on Wednesday. Oil prices could fall further ahead of OPEC's next meeting in February 2023 due to lack of clarity about the group's strategy, Yeap added.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

While the 401(k) plan continues to be an essential workplace benefit to attract and retain talent, plan sponsors emphasized the need for an attractive plan with a range of features to meet the evolving financial needs of a diverse workforce.Based on survey results, plan sponsors continue to see the 401(k) as a leading retirement benefit when it comes to attracting and retaining talent—a top priority. As the economic climate becomes more complex, plan design has emerged as a differentiator to help drive employee enrollment and support the company’s talent strategy. 401(k) plans with a Financial Advisor, or that offer features like a Roth or company match, are seen as more attractive with higher enrollment rates, which in turn inform employee satisfaction and support retention. The research also shows an increased need for employee financial education that is engaging, tailored to specific life or financial stages, and digital-friendly.Plan sponsors cite features of an attractive 401(k) plan to boost engagement and participation including:Access to a Financial Advisor strongly correlates with employee participation: Of those plan sponsors who reported full employee participation, 80% had a plan Financial Advisor. A 401(k) Financial Advisor brings value for enrollment, engagement, and talent.Plan design makes a difference: In addition to a 401(k) benefit plan, plan sponsors report 23% of companies also offer a Roth 401(k), followed by auto-enrollment (20%), and profit sharing (18%) to help encourage enrollment.Auto features help increase participation: Plan sponsors identified automatic escalation (43%), automatic employer contribution (40%), and automatic enrollment (37%) as plan features with the highest participation, helping employers meet employees where they are today.Education should be engaging, tailored, and digital: Most plan sponsors (87%) believe providers are sharing engaging participant retirement and financial education. However, they say content should be even more engaging and based on individual financial stages (44%), delivered through digital tools (39%), and specifically tailored to life events (36%).Story continues""The 401(k) plan has been around for decades and is largely the most popular workplace benefit to help employees build their retirement nest egg,"" said Anthony Bunnell, Head of Retirement for Morgan Stanley at Work. ""The dynamics of today’s economy have changed, with employers and employees alike juggling numerous competing financial needs. So, it’s not surprising that plans with Financial Advisors are associated with more engaged employees, as a Financial Advisor can play a central role not just in managing the plan, but in helping employees navigate the markets and invest in their future.""Morgan Stanley at Work’s 2022 Plan Sponsor Retirement study can be found here.

The new price target by that team is $153 on JPMorgan. That's $30 higher than its previous price target. Morgan Stanley notes that JP Morgan will have positive operating leverage next year, meaning it will be in a better position to generate a revenue and bottom line profits.Yeah, interesting. I mentioned this morning in our morning meeting how these double upgrades were such a rarity among Wall Street analysts, but we're seeing yet another one here. We've seen a bunch of other ones in different sectors over the past two months and to year end. But this one, perhaps, making a lot of sense. This now removes any sell ratings on JP Morgan on Wall Street and comes likely as margins get lifted with a couple more rate hikes in the fold.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and it's particularly interesting, too, after the commentary that we've continued to hear from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has talked about everything from an economic hurricane, even to what a recession may look like going into 2023.But for JP Morgan and some of perhaps the resumption of deal making and being able to underwrite some of those larger deals that perhaps do finally make their way into the public market next year after the quiet year that 2022 was, especially on the number of companies that went public or that were just looking for underwriters to be able to finance some of the larger deals as well, that could perhaps be one of the larger upsides that is baked into this, too, going forward from here, when that resumes.JULIE HYMAN: JP Morgan is down about 17% year to date, which is an under or overperformance, depending on what you measure it against. The S&amp;P Bank Index, that's going in today, by the way. The S&amp;P Bank Index was down 21%. But the KBE ETF was down 14%, so I guess, again, it depends upon what basket you're looking at it against.But Betsy Graseck and her team, in making this call and this upgrade, says it really has to do with an inflection in operating leverage, that that is going to improve for the bank, that risks around operating leverage skewed to the upside. The company is also looking at the ratio requirements. Remember, the government has various capital ratio requirements for the banks, especially in the wake of the financial crisis. They got more stringent. And she is talking about that the company is making progress towards meeting those capital ratio requirements.BRIAN SOZZI: And look, it keeps them-- keep in mind we're hearing from Jamie Dimon today. JPMorgan CEO warning about a potential recession. I like what Matt Maley told us, though, on these bank stocks. They will not be immune, of course, to a recession, even if rates go higher and margins benefit.]"

Refinitiv Eikon data showed the currency trading at 12.50 to the dollar on Wednesday, compared to 14.00 a week ago.Public debt was 467.4 billion cedis or $48.9 billion in September, of which 42% was domestic debt, according to the most recent central bank figures released last month.Ghana is also planning to exchange local dollar bills, cocoa bills, and domestic non-marketable debt at a ""later stage"", the finance ministry said.Cocoa bills and domestic non-marketable debt would be exchanged ""under comparable terms"" to the domestic bond restructuring announced on Monday, the finance ministry said in a Q&amp;A statement, but did not provide any further details.Ghana's government is also planning to restructure its foreign debt, including $13 billion of Eurobonds that have traded at deeply distressed levels of below 50 cents on the dollar for months, but has not yet set out proposals.(Reporting by Cooper Inveen and Christian Akorlie; Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Rodrigo Campos in New York; Writing by Rachel Savage and Nellie Peyton; Editing by James Macharia Chege, Alex Richardson, William Maclean and Nick Macfie)]"

Economists said the reading pointed to elevated labor costs and inflation staying high, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep raising rates.But benchmark U.S. yields and the dollar both fell, suggesting lower rates ahead.""Slower rate hikes have been the trend globally of late, but the Fed remains a wild card. Overall, it's a fickle, anxious market ahead of next week's Fed meeting,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Convera in Washington.The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq fell, adding to the prior day's sell-off on warnings by three major U.S. banks of a looming recession. Questions about how sticky inflation might be have raised uncertainty about the Fed's policy path as the pace of future inflation remains unknown.""Looking back in previous decades of high levels of inflation, it usually takes a few years for inflation to moderate,"" said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance in London.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.42%, while the broad European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.62% to mark its fourth straight decline as fears of a global recession intensified.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.19% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.51%.Many in the market believe inflation is moderating and bond yields have peaked, allowing central banks to begin slowing rate hikes when policy-makers from the Fed, Bank of England and European Central Bank meet next week.The Bank of Canada signaled on Wednesday that its historic tightening campaign was near an end as it raised benchmark overnight interest rates by 50 basis points to 4.25%, the highest level in almost 15 years.Story continuesEarlier, the Reserve Bank of India slowed the pace of rate increases with a 35 basis point hike of its key lending rate to 6.25%, but warned inflation could remain pervasive and elevated.Fed Chair Jerome Powell also has warned the fight against inflation is far from over, but late last month he said the Fed could ease the pace of its rate hikes as soon as December.Powell's comments have led the market to price in a lower peak interest rate, which Fed funds futures showed on Wednesday to be 4.918% next May, down from recent highs above 5.1%. Futures show the terminal rate at 4.419% in December 2023.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell 9.2 basis points to an almost three-month low of 3.421%. But the inversion of two- and 10-year note yields, a recession harbinger, deepened at -84.5 basis points.Gold prices rose, helped by a retreat in the dollar and Treasury yields, as investors anticipate the projection of slower rate hikes at the Fed's meeting on Dec. 13-14.U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% higher at $1,798 an ounce.The dollar slipped as traders weighed up an uncertain economic outlook, while China's yuan firmed as authorities loosened some of the country's zero-COVID rules.The euro gained 0.37% to $1.0508, and the yen strengthened 0.44% to 136.45 per dollar.China's national health authority said asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and those with mild symptoms can self-treat while in quarantine at home, the strongest sign so far that Beijing is preparing to live with the disease.Market reaction was negative as the focus shifts to how well China can execute its policy shift.""It is difficult to assume that China's reopening will not be inflationary when the opposite was true for the rest of the world and that will be the challenge heading into 2022,"" said Geoff Yu, strategist at BNY Mellon.Oil slid to its lowest since the start of the year in volatile trading after U.S. government data showed an unexpectedly large build in fuel stocks, feeding fears about demand in a market already spooked by an uncertain economy.U.S. crude fell $2.24 to settle at $72.01 a barrel, while Brent settled down $2.18 at $77.17.(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Danilo Masoni in Milan; Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by John Stonestreet, Nick Zieminski and David Gregorio)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the free market as it pertains to ethical conduct in the US and go directly to 5 Most Ethical Companies in the US. Young people are becoming increasingly awake to the social, historical, climate and financial injustices and choose to give business to, and invest in companies that share their values. Many corporations have responded positively to the development. “Ethical” CapitalismTo give you a quantitative perspective on the corporate ethical turn, Yale School of Management has compiled a list of 138 corporations with extended women’s benefits, not offered by other corporations. Out of these, nearly a third are tech corporations. The most prominent ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In terms of doing business in Russia, over a 1,000 corporations (majority of them American) have left the country after it invaded the neighboring Ukraine. Evidence indicates that the equity market’s reward to the companies for the action far outweighs the potential loss from leaving Russia. On the other hand, companies that are still engaged in business with Russia are being punished by investors. At the sustainability front, many companies have adopted “planet friendly” policies to lower the burden on Earth’s ecosystem and climate. However, most of the corporate sector has been called out several times for “greenwashing” and not actually doing enough. Regardless, the companies we’ve discussed are doing their part for sustainability as well as social and financial justice. ESG’s Impact on a Company’s Financial PerformanceESG refers to the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. It's a set of standards that impact-investors look at when investing based on values. Stern School of Business carried out a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, done between the period of 2015-2020, and concluded that ESG and corporate financial performance had a statistically significant positive correlation for 58% of the studies. The analysis also discovered that corporate investments in sustainability were actually advantageous in the long-term while having no impact on financial performance in the short-term.Story continuesNow that we have the perspective on the ethical free market, let’s move on to the list of 22 most ethical companies in the US. 22 Most Ethical Companies in the USPhoto by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 22 most ethical companies in the US, we’ve ranked them based on how many times they’ve been hailed as honorees for being ethical up until 2022 by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in assessing ethical businesses.We’ve also mentioned each company’s ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a premier ESG grader.

INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp.

At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”7.

If you want to see more best AI stocks, go directly to 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.AI, which stands for artificial intelligence, is already helping companies make better decisions. For retailers, AI is helping price items so companies sell more items. For internet companies, artificial intelligence is helping companies sell more ads more efficiently. For banks, the technology is helping financial institutions make better loans.For the future, AI will likely make possible many new technologies that could benefit society. For the car industry, AI could make possible autonomous driving that could lower costs. For the education industry, it could offer even better personalized learning that could make education more efficient. For the pharmaceutical industry, AI could help create new medicines that improve the lives of billions.Given how transformative AI could be, PwC estimates worldwide GDP will be 14% higher by the end of the decade thanks to AI as the technology increases productivity gains.For the decades beyond 2030, it is likely AI's contribution will be even greater. In the future, AI progress could accelerate if quantum computing ever becomes feasible. With quantum computing, computers can do certain tasks far faster than any traditional computer can and the faster computing could help AI be even more productive.Given the vast potential of AI, many of the world's leading tech companies are working on making the technology better.Some companies like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) are working on building quantum computers while others like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are working on building more efficient semiconductors that power machine learning algorithms. Yet others like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are working on building autonomous driving vehicles.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone. As a result, demand for many companies has declined and the broader market has declined.Story continuesYear to date, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.6% and the Nasdaq has declined 29% year to date. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Advanced AI Companies, we picked 10 leading tech companies that did AI research.Given which company is more advanced than another is subjective, we decided to use market capitalization as a way to rank the best AI stocks since a company having a larger market capitalization can generally mean it has more potential resources to perform AI research.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.For those of you interested, also check out 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.10 Most Advanced AI Companies10.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Market Capitalization as of 12/5: $408.61 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading semicoductor company that could benefit from the growth of AI in the future given its GPUs can speed up computational processes for machine learning. Baron Funds described NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI potential in a Q3 2022 investor letter,NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.As of December 5, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $408.61 billion, ranking #5 on our list of best AI stocks.Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are leading tech companies that do AI research that many hedge funds in our database were long at the end of the third quarter.Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 10 Most Advanced AI Companies is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

These markets are not only poised to see the strongest combined growth in home sales and listing prices in the coming year, but up to this point they have seen lower price increases, a relatively smaller affordability crunch than other markets across the U.S.Top Markets of 2023Mainly concentrated in mid-size markets east of the Mississippi, with local industries tied to manufacturing, education, healthcare and government, this year's top 10, in rank order, are Hartford-West Hartford, Conn., El Paso, Texas, Louisville, Ky., Worcester, Mass., Buffalo-Cheektowaga N.Y., Augusta-Richmond County, Ga., Grand Rapids-Wyoming, Mich., Columbia, S.C., Chattanooga, Tenn., and Toledo, Ohio. (See below for the full ranking of the 100 largest U.S. markets.)Home sales across the top 10 markets are forecasted to grow by 5.2% year-over-year in 2022, whereas the national homes sale projection is for declining sales (-14.1%). Additionally, average home prices in the top 10 are expected to increase 7.3% – compared to 5.4% for the U.S. as a whole.At a time when housing costs are a concern for many, these areas offer relative affordability, having experienced less of a price surge than other extremely hot, pandemic-era markets. They also have a greater share of homeowners who own their homes outright, without a mortgage, giving more residents equity to build on. In the top 10 markets, about 23% of housing inventory is affordable at the median income level, compared to just 17% of affordable homes nationally. Better affordability offers some insulation from the impact of rising mortgage rates.Story continues""As many households keep a close watch on their spending, we expect these top housing markets to be in relatively high demand,"" says Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""We've seen lower price increases, more general affordability and more use of government-backed mortgage products for veterans, first-time and minority buyers in these top markets, providing opportunities for all home buyers to stretch their homebuying dollars. Many of these areas flew under the radar in the pandemic frenzy, and are now well-positioned to bubble up with solid job prospects without the big-city price tag.Top Markets Sidestepped Steep Prices of 2022This year's top 10 housing markets didn't get as caught up in the wild buying frenzy – and price increases – of 2022 as other areas. Sale prices in the 12 months ending August 2022 increased by 10.5% on a year-over-year basis, compared to a growth rate of 12.6% for all 100 largest metros. The top markets have also seen less of a dip in sales in recent months, with sales declining by 9.1% year-over-year, compared to an average decline of 12.3% for all 100 metro areas.""Made in America"" Mid-Sized Metros Poised to Bubble Up Representing a shift from remote-work and tech-industry influenced home buying, this year's top markets have a renewed focus on domestic industry and trade. The pandemic exposed an achilles heel of the far-flung supply chains that had become the norm, namely, that logistics can be disrupted by a wide array of events. This has renewed corporate, government, and consumer focus in these markets where ""Made in America"" happens.On average, these mid-sized metros employ a higher proportion of workers in manufacturing, government, education and healthcare jobs relative to the 100 largest US metros, while jobs in tech, professional services, information technology and leisure/hospitality are less common in these areas. Having largely avoided the pandemic housing boom that we saw in other markets, home buyers in the top markets can find solid job prospects and affordable housing options.Attractive to Out-Of-Town BuyersAlmost half of the buyers looking at the top 10 markets are from areas outside those states. For example, in Hartford, Conn., with a median price of $375,000 in October 2022, homebuyers from New York, Boston and Washington, DC, were leading the wave of out-of-state views in the third quarter of 2022, finding a significant value proposition compared not only to the high price of houses in New York City ($670,000), but also the national median ($425,000). With remote work opportunities still robust, and affordability top of mind, these markets will continue to draw buyers from out of state.Buyers Take Advantage of Government-Backed Loans Home sales in the top 10 metros also tend to leverage more government-backed mortgage products such as VA loans and FHA loans. Between Jan.-Aug. 2022, the share of mortgaged-sales with a VA loan was 9.4% in the top 10 markets vs. 7.5% among all the 100 markets reviewed. These types of loans help buyers safely enter the market with lower down payments and often slightly lower mortgage rates.Realtor.com® 2023 Top Housing Markets1.  Hartford-West Hartford et al, Conn.November 2022 median home price: $372,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +6.5%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +8.5%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +15.0%2.  El Paso, TexasNovember 2022 median home price: $291,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +8.9%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +5.4%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +14.3%3.  Louisville et al, Ky-Ind.November 2022 median home price: $290,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +5.2%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +8.4%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +13.6%4.  Worcester, Mass.-Conn.November 2022 median home price: $447,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +2.5%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +10.6%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +13.1%5.  Buffalo-Cheektowaga et al, N.Y.November 2022 median home price: $240,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +6.3%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +6.0%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +12.3%6.  Augusta-Richmond County, Ga.-S.C.November 2022 median home price: $319,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +6.2%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +5.7%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.9%7.  Grand Rapids-Wy., Mich.November 2022 median home price: $358,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +1.6%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +10.0%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.6%8.  Columbia, S.C.November 2022 median home price: $300,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +7.7%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +3.6%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.3%9.  Chattanooga, Tenn.-Ga.November 2022 median home price: $397,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +2.9%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +8.2%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.1%10.  Toledo, OhioNovember 2022 median home price: $161,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +4.2%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +6.7%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +10.9%Realtor.com® 2023 Housing Forecast – 100 Largest U.S. Metros (Ranked)Rank*MetroCombined Sales &amp;

The IDSP is a first-of-its-kind cross-industry partnership to help advance more open and accessible private-sector data for societal good. The founding members of the IDSP agree to provide greater access to their data, where appropriate, to help tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges in areas such as sustainability and inclusive economic growth.Microsoft company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Microsoft Corp.) (PRNewsfoto/Microsoft Corp.)In the past few years, open data has played a critical role in enabling faster research and collaboration across industries and with the public sector. As we saw during COVID-19, pandemic data that was made more open enabled researchers to make faster progress and gave citizens more information to inform their day-to-day activities. The IDSP's goal is to continue this model into new areas and help address other complex societal challenges. The IDSP will serve as a forum for the participating companies to foster collaboration, as well as a resource for other entities working on related issues.IDSP members commit to the following:To open data or provide greater access to data, where appropriate, to help solve pressing societal problems in a usable, responsible and inclusive manner.To share knowledge and information for the effective use of open data and data collaboration for social benefit.To invest in skilling a broad class of professionals to use data effectively and responsibly for social impact.To protect individuals' privacy in all these activities.The IDSP will also bring in other organizations with expertise in societal issues. At launch, The GovLab's Data Program based at New York University and the Open Data Institute will both be partnership Affiliates to provide guidance and expertise for partnership endeavors.Story continuesAs part of their work together, participating IDSP companies will launch a Data for Local Environments Challenge with the Open Data Institute. Using publicly available datasets and datasets shared or curated by the private sector, participants will explore how officials in cities, counties and municipalities can use these datasets to generate insights and solutions to improve their local environments, such as reaching their net zero goals. More about the data challenge can be found here. Registration will open in early 2023.The IDSP will also foster connections between industry and the public sector, researchers and academics to better understand how industry data can improve their work. The partnership's first engagement is with the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and the United States National Committee for CODATA (USNC/CODATA) to plan a Summit that will convene scholars, government, industry and nonprofit research organizations to surface opportunities to work together across disciplines, leverage the strengths of individuals organizations and move common agendas forward more rapidly.

The duration of the deal can be further extended after the initial period and Microsoft is committed to expanding the number of platforms on which people can play games, Xbox chief Phil Spencer told Bloomberg News. Microsoft also said it’s committed to offering Call of Duty on Valve Corp.’s Steam platform at the same time as it’s released on Xbox.The company has extended a similar offer to Sony Group Corp., to bring the famous Activision franchise to PlayStation consoles for a decade, but that has so far been rebuffed by the Japanese company, Spencer said. Sony has fiercely objected to the Activision acquisition, primarily because of concerns the US tech giant could make content like Call of Duty exclusive to its own gaming services.“This deal and especially its timing clearly looks like Microsoft trying to appease regulators,” said Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto. “I have a hard time imagining recent mainline Call of Duty titles running on current Nintendo hardware, but the next Switch will certainly be able to handle such a game.”Microsoft executives are set to meet with US Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and other commissioners Wednesday to make its final case in support of the deal.“Our intent is to become more relevant on more screens,” Spencer said. “We have a pretty good idea of how to build a win-win relationship with Nintendo and frankly Sony.”Story continuesNintendo shares in Tokyo erased losses on the day and were up as much as 1.5% after the announcement. Sony widened losses to 1.3%.Representatives of Nintendo and Sony Interactive Entertainment declined to comment.Read more: Microsoft Is Ready to Fight for $69 Billion Activision DealSpencer remains confident that Microsoft’s Activision takeover will be approved by regulators, with the company setting a timeline of getting that deal done by the end of its fiscal year, which is in June. He sees the steps taken by Microsoft with Nintendo and Valve — assuring them of the prized asset for their competing gaming platforms — as a signal of Microsoft’s push to be inclusive and distribute its portfolio of gaming content widely.“There’s been one game industry participant that’s really been raising all the objections, and that’s Sony, and they’ve been fairly public about the things that don’t meet their expectations,” Spencer said. “From where we sit, it’s clear they’re spending more time with the regulators than they are with us to try and get this deal done.”Outside of Sony’s objection to the Activision acquisition, Microsoft has seen “a lot of support from the industry,” he added.Read more: Microsoft to Meet with FTC Chair Lina Khan on Activision Deal--With assistance from Dina Bass, Takashi Mochizuki and Yuki Furukawa.(Updates with Nintendo response and analyst comment)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTikTok’s Problem Child Has 7 Million Followers and One Proud MomThe US’s New Approach to Venezuela Is Starting to Bear FruitThe Viral List That Turned a Yale Professor Into an Enemy of the Russian StateSome Bosses Embrace Work From Home to Keep Wages DownAirbus Is Coming for Boeing’s 737©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Microsoft is open to making the 10-year contract with Sony “legally enforceable by regulators in the U.S., U.K. and European Union,” Microsoft president Brad Smith wrote in a Dec. 5 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, noting that the company “made a similar commitment to the European Commission” to ensure access to key technologies to competitors when Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in 2016. Sony has not commented on Microsoft’s “Call of Duty” offer but has voiced opposition to the Activision takeover.In January, Microsoft announced its $69 billion bid for Activision Blizzard, which would be the biggest-ever acquisition in the video-game business. The companies have said they expect the deal to close in June 2023.The FTC is expected to discuss the antitrust implications of Microsoft’s proposed deal for Activision Blizzard at a closed meeting Thursday, as the agency is reportedly planning to launch a lawsuit seeking to block the deal. The concern among regulators is that Microsoft could favor its own Xbox consoles for Activision Blizzard titles at the expense of rivals like Sony and Nintendo.Story continuesMeanwhile, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority antitrust regulator has an active investigation into whether the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal would reduce competition in the market.“Call of Duty” is Activision Blizzard’s best-selling game. According to Activision Blizzard, the latest installment in the the first-person shooter franchise, “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,” hit $1 billion in worldwide sales in the first 10 days after its Oct. 28 release — beating the previous franchise record of 15 days set in 2012 by “Call of Duty: Black Ops II.”VIP+ Analysis: ‘MWII’ Success Key for Activision BlizzardBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"

78,0e9670d5-8a91-3a83-aba5-7ee0fd3e8f08,SNPS,2022-12-07,Synopsys (SNPS) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/synopsys-snps-upgraded-buy-heres-170005614.html,1670346005,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Investors might want to bet on Synopsys (SNPS), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Synopsys is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Synopsys, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for SynopsysFor the fiscal year ending October 2023, this maker of software used to test and develop chips is expected to earn $10.13 per share, which is a change of 13.8% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Synopsys. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Synopsys to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

79,e2afbd87-9e49-393a-90a4-60f96cbfc86e,SNPS,2022-12-07,Wall Street Analysts Predict a 29% Upside in Synopsys (SNPS): Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-predict-29-145502735.html,1670338502,STORY,"['SNPS', 'TGT']","[Shares of Synopsys (SNPS) have gained 18.1% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $331.27, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $428.73 indicates a potential upside of 29.4%.The mean estimate comprises 11 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $19.93. While the lowest estimate of $400 indicates a 20.8% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 41% to reach $467. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in SNPS. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for SNPSHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why SNPS Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, four estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days while one has gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 5.5%.Moreover, SNPS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much SNPS could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This statistic is unearthed in ""The Cost of Poor Software Quality in the US: A 2022 Report."" The report's findings reflect that as of 2022, the cost of poor software quality in the U.S.—which includes cyber-attacks due to existing vulnerabilities, complex issues involving the software supply chain, and the growing impact of rapidly accumulating technical debt—have led to a build-up of historic software deficiencies.Co-sponsored by Synopsys, the report was produced by the Consortium for Information &amp; Software Quality (CISQ), an organization developing international standards to automate software quality measurement and promoting the development and maintenance of secure, reliable, and trustworthy software.""Cybercrime is predicted to cost the world $7 trillion in 2022,"" said report author, Herb Krasner, retired Professor of Software Engineering, University of Texas at Austin,. ""With that top of mind, 'The Cost of Poor Software Quality in the US: A 2022 Report' offers practical advice and specific guidance for software engineers, project teams, and organizational leaders to proactively improve the quality of the software they use and build. Now is the time to turn our attention to recent developments and emerging solutions to help improve the poor software quality situation as it now exists and stabilize and reduce the growth rate of CPSQ in the near future.""The report highlights several key areas of CPSQ growth, including:Cybercrime losses due to a rising number of software vulnerabilities. Losses rose 64% from 2020 to 2021, and are on track for a further 42% increase from 2021 to 2022. The quantity and cost of cybercrime incidents have been on the rise for over a decade, and now account for a sum equivalent to the world's third largest economy after the U.S. and China.Software supply chain problems with underlying third-party components are up significantly. This year's report shows that the number of failures due to weaknesses in open source software components accelerated by an alarming 650% from 2020 to 2021.Technical debt has become the largest obstacle to making changes in existing code bases. Technical debt refers to software development rework costs from the accumulation of deficiencies leaving data and systems potentially vulnerable. This year's report illustrates that deficiencies aren't being resolved, leading technical debt to increase to approximately $1.52 trillion.Story continues""In today's complex software supply chain, just because a newly-added open source component is secure today, does not mean that it will be secure tomorrow,"" said Dr. Anita D'Amico, Synopsys Software Integrity Group VP of Cross-Portfolio Solutions and Strategy and CISQ Board Member. ""Creating a software Bill of Materials (SBOM) allows organizations to proactively gather a comprehensive inventory of the components used to make up a piece of software. That means when a new vulnerability is identified in an existing component, organizations can quickly identify where it is in their software and take action to remedy it.""The report also found that operational failures, primarily due to cyber-attacks and open source deficiencies, have risen alongside technical debt as deficiencies aren't being resolved at a comparable rate. With these rises, developments in technologies and practices to remediate issues have also matured considerably in recent years. Using software quality standards in association with related tooling solutions, assessing and monitoring third party and open source components, and applying patches in a timely manner are all key strategies in reducing CPSQ.To learn more, download a copy of The Cost of Poor Software Quality in the US: A 2022 Report or read our blog post highlighting the report's key takeaways.About the Synopsys Software Integrity GroupSynopsys Software Integrity Group provides integrated solutions that transform the way development teams build and deliver software, accelerating innovation while addressing business risk.

81,cd5e6eab-68c9-37d8-8bac-239ac7c29da7,MNST,2022-12-07,3 Beverage Innovators to Caffeinate your Watchlist,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-beverage-innovators-caffeinate-watchlist-185906365.html,1670353146,STORY,['MNST'],"[Do you know what the top-performing stock has been over the past 20 years? The probable answers to this question from most investors are probably along the lines of Apple (AAPL), Amazon AMZN, or Alphabet GOOGL. Though thosewould be good guesses, they would be incorrect. Monster Beverage Corporation MNST (formerly known as Hansen Natural, ticker symbol HANS) is the top performer by a long shot. Over the past 20 years, Monster has racked up more than 100,000% in gains, far outpacing any tech stock. To put Monster’s performance in perspective, the second-largest winner over that time is Tractor Supply Co. TSCO, which has scored gains of more than 40,000%. Below I will discuss where Monster is today, plus two other innovative beverage companies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPicutred: Monster Beverage's performance over the past 20 years versus the S&amp;P 500 Monster Beverage: Innovation Leads to SuccessHansen’s, later called Hansen Natural and ultimately Monster Beverage Corp was founded in 1935. For years Hansen existed as a relatively obscure beverage brand that sold juices and “healthy” sodas. That was until 2002, when Hansen decided to diverge from its core business and foray into the energy drink market. Hansen created the Monster Energy Drink, a high-octane carbonated energy drink packed with vitamins. In other words, the company devised a novel way to deliver caffeine, the world’s most popular “drug” to the masses. The rest is history. At this time, Monster accounts for a little less than half of the gargantuan $5.7 billion energy drink market in the U.S.Monster proves that well-executed innovation and risk-taking can lead to success and massive gains for investors. However, with success, management has yet to rest on its laurels and continues to introduce unique beverages. The Monster brand has more than 30 different drink offerings including energy teas, coffee mixtures, and muscle drinks. Monster’s success has not gone unnoticed. In 2015, the Coca-Cola Company KO, the king of the beverage market, shelled out more than $2 billion to take a 16% stake in the company. Currently, Coca-Cola is the largest shareholder in the firm and has a stake of just shy of 20%.Story continuesDoes Monster’s Stock Still Have Energy?As Monster has grown to be one of the prominent players in the beverage space, the pace of growth has slowed little, with the last eight quarterly reports showing double-digit revenue growth. Last quarter, Monster reported record net sales of $1.62 billion, rising 15% year over year. Despite the impressive sales growth, quarterly EPS fell 5% due to higher input costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and increased co-packaging costs. Nevertheless, management instilled confidence in the company’s prospects by announcing a new share repurchase program of $500 million.Bottom LineWhile Monster does not paint the perfect fundamental picture, there is much to be positive about over the next few years. First, the company has the backing of the most successful beverage company of all time, Coca-Cola. Second, management is buying back shares, a move that will create a floor for shares and increase confidence among investors. Lastly, inflation and the U.S. dollar continue to drop from lofty levels early this year – a tailwind for the company.Celsius Holdings: Flipping the Narrative on Energy DrinksLike Monster Beverage, Celsius Holdings Inc CELH has leveraged innovation to achieve massive success in the beverage space. Celsius has taken advantage of the prevailing narrative that most energy drinks are unhealthy and cause late-day crashes and jitters. Rather than create a caffeine-packed unhealthy energy drink, Celsius energy drinks contain no preservatives, high fructose corn syrup, or artificial ingredients. The bet has paid off.A Healthy Fundamental PictureBefore the last quarter, where the company achieved 98% revenue growth, Celsius had five straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth. Though last quarter’s earnings saw negative impacts from a one-time sales and marketing termination expense of $155 million, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA vaulted to $24.8 million compared to the $10.3 million the company earned in the previous year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Zacks Mean Annual EPS estimates for CELHWhat does the future hold for Celsius?Celsius’s earnings history suggests that healthy energy drinks are here to stay. Zack’s Mean Consensus Estimates suggest that the company will continue to grow rapidly. GAAP estimates move back into positive territory in 2023 and Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate them to jump drastically in 2024. Like Monster Beverage, Celsius has a big backer in its corner, PepsiCo PEP. In August, Pepsi inked a $550 million deal that will give Pepsi an 8.5% in stake in the company, a seat on the board of directors, and a long-term distribution agreement. Pepsi’s agreement with Celsius provides investors with a vote of confidence and should help Celsius to continue to its meteoric growth phase and achieve further scale.Vita Coco: The Newcomer Vita Coco COCOis taking advantage of one of the hottest beverage trends over the past few years, coconut water. Vita Coco came public in October of 2021. Beyond the company’s top-selling coconut water, Vita Coco offers a clean energy drink, enhanced water products, and protein-infused water.FundamentalsThough Vita Coco is much smaller in market cap than Celsius, the company is growing at a slower pace. Last quarter sales increased a tepid 7% while gross profits decreased $11 million over the previous year to $81 million, driven by higher transportation costs. Recent Zack’s revenue estimates suggest that earnings growth will not turn around soon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Coco's uninspiring revenue revisionsTakeawayAt this point, Vita Coco is less attractive than its peers. Celsius and Monster boast more impressive fundamentals, higher liquidity, and the backing of industry leaders such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Nevertheless, investors should watch to see if Vita Coco’s brand can catch on in the next few years. If this is the case, we have learned from Monster and Celsius that it can lead to massive performance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Coca-Cola European has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Monster Beverage has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CCEP likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MNST has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CCEP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.66, while MNST has a forward P/E of 44.91. We also note that CCEP has a PEG ratio of 1.32. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MNST currently has a PEG ratio of 3.95.Another notable valuation metric for CCEP is its P/B ratio of 2.94. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MNST has a P/B of 7.90.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help CCEP earn a Value grade of A, while MNST has been given a Value grade of D.CCEP stands above MNST thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CCEP is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is 24 percentage points higher than the national average of 57%.Twice a year, The Leapfrog Group assigns an ""A,"" ""B,"" ""C,"" ""D"" or ""F"" Safety Grade to general hospitals across the country based on how well they protect patients from preventable medical errors, accidents, injuries and infections. The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade utilizes national patient safety measures from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Leapfrog Hospital Survey to make their assessment.""We are proud of this accomplishment and of the culture of safety HCA Healthcare continues to foster across our organization,"" said Karla Miller, chief patient safety officer at HCA Healthcare. ""We could not have achieved this without our extraordinary physicians, nurses and critical support staff members who dedicate themselves to protecting each patient who walks through the doors of an HCA Healthcare facility.""Eighty-two HCA Healthcare hospitals earned an ""A."" Rose Medical Center in Denver, Colorado and St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas received a ""Straight A"" designation for achieving an ""A"" grade in every update of the Hospital Safety Grade. They are among the 22 hospitals nationwide to achieve the ""Straight A"" designation since the ratings began in 2012.HCA Healthcare has a long history of prioritizing and working to continually improve patient safety, including:Establishing a Patient Safety Organization (PSO) to improve patient safety and the quality of healthcare delivery by partnering with colleagues at HCA Healthcare facilities to build systems, refine processes and foster a culture of safety.Developing evidence-based perinatal protocols through the company’s longstanding partnership with March of Dimes, such as prohibiting elective delivery prior to 39 weeks to help babies have a healthy start to life. This best practice has now been adopted worldwide as a standard of care. HCA Healthcare has also worked to identify and develop solutions for top perinatal safety risks including preeclampsia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in C-Section deliveries, and post-partum hemorrhage.Hosting the REDUCE MRSA study, with nearly 75,000 patients across 43 HCA Healthcare hospitals, which found that using antimicrobial soap and ointment to decolonize all ICU patients reduced bloodstream infections by 44% and MRSA by 37%. The CDC has since adopted this practice.Conducting the ABATE Infection Trial at 53 HCA Healthcare hospitals with 330,000 patients in 194 non-ICU units, which found an infection control technique achieved a 31% reduction in bloodstream infections and nearly a 40% reduction in antibiotic-resistant bacteria among non-ICU patients with central line catheters and lumbar drains.Developing the Sepsis Prediction and Optimization of Therapy (SPOT) tool, a system to help clinicians more quickly identify patients with sepsis.Building upon the capabilities of SPOT technology to develop the Next-gen Analytics for Treatment and Efficiency (NATE) platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. NATE brings analytic insights to assist clinicians in applying the appropriate clinical protocol for mechanically ventilated patients. This ability helped to decrease length of stay and increase survival in HCA Healthcare facilities by 28%.Reducing HCA Healthcare’s average door-to-needle-time to 34 minutes, faster than the national standard for stroke care.Story continuesAbout HCA HealthcareNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 182 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.

Insiders might have been better off holding onto their shares, given that the average selling price of US$362 is still below the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President &amp; COO, John Waldron, for US$5.2m worth of shares, at about US$387 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$363. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. Specifically, insiders ditched US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$539m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Goldman Sachs Group. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Goldman Sachs Group.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

""I think there's a reasonable possibility we could navigate a scenario like that.""""But I also think there's a very reasonable possibility that we could have a recession of some kind,"" Solomon added.David Solomon, Chairman and CEO, Goldman Sachs, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference on May 2, 2022 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Solomon's personal view reflects noticeably less optimism than the consensus forecasts of economists at his firm, who see the U.S. economy “narrowly avoiding” a recession and stocks closing flat next year.The firm's equity strategy team led by David Kostin said in its year-ahead outlook published last month they expect the S&amp;P 500 will finish 2023 at 4,000. The benchmark index closed at 3,941 on Tuesday.When asked about the 10-year Treasury yield in a Q&amp;A at the end of his interview, Solomon said his view depends on whether or not an economic downturn can be avoided.“As opposed to giving you a number, if you listen to my view, we’ve got a yield curve that if you normalize — if you get that soft landing — you’ll see that 10-year Treasury yield higher,” Solomon said. “If you don’t get that soft landing, you’re going to see a reversal of policy, and then you can see rates the same or lower.”It is unsurprising, according to Solomon, to be in a period of higher rates as the Federal Reserve attempts to bring down inflation caused by extensive fiscal stimulus and the ""black swan"" effects of war in Eastern Europe.Story continues“The market is making an assumption that we’ll reach the terminal rate sometime soon and the [Fed] will bring rates back down, and if you look at most tightening cycles, historically, after some period of time, you do see a reversal,” Solomon said. “But I think we're still early in this – I think it's uncertain.”Goldman Sachs forecasts the U.S. central bank’s key policy rate, the federal funds rate, to peak at 5% to 5.25% around mid-next year.However, economists at the investment bank do not expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in 2023.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It deploys digital solutions and innovative technologies in the energy industry, including oil and natural gas.It has expertise in 120 countries.A Perfect Earnings Surprise RecordOn Oct 21, 2022, Schlumberger reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by $0.08. Earnings were $0.63 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.55.It was another beat in a 5-year perfect earnings track record. That's impressive as it includes the pandemic and the collapse of the crude market in 2020.Revenue rose 28% year-over-year and 10% from the second quarter to $7.5 billion. International revenue drove the quarter as it was up 13% sequentially to $5.9 billion while North America was flat sequentially at $1.5 billion.Revenue growth was propelled by Well Construction and Production Systems as global activity strengthened, particularly in the offshore and international markets.Well Construction revenue was up 15% sequentially, outperforming global rig count growth due to strong activity and pricing improvements in Europe/CIA/Africa and Latin America.Production Systems revenue rose 14% sequentially on higher product deliveries and backlog conversion, mostly in international offshore basins.Analysts Raise Earnings EstimatesSchlumberger was bullish about the fourth quarter, saying it expected to deliver further sequential revenue growth and margin expansion.9 estimates are higher for 2022 in the last 2 months, including one in just the last week, pushing up the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $2.15 from $2.02 during that time.That is earnings growth of 68% as Schlumberger made just $1.28 last year.9 estimates have also been revised for 2023 in the last 60 days as well.

At the same time, the Dow lost 1.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.2%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had lost 6.26% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 2.49% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.22% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.68, up 65.85% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.75 billion, up 24.43% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.15 per share and revenue of $27.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of +67.97% and +21.68%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”7.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) and its subsidiary, Biotheranostics, Inc., today announced new study data showing that the Breast Cancer Index test identified which premenopausal patients with early-stage, hormone-receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer benefited from the addition of ovarian function suppression (OFS) to primary adjuvant endocrine therapy. The Breast Cancer Index test is the first biomarker to be evaluated in a cohort from the landmark Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT). The translational study results are featured in the official press program at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) being held from December 6-10, 2022.1 Full study results were presented during the general session #GS1-06 on December 6 at 3:15 p.m. CST.""There is a significant need for biomarkers to aid in treatment decisions for premenopausal women with breast cancer. Our study presented at SABCS is the first to examine a biomarker’s ability to determine benefit of ovarian function suppression in these women,"" said Dr. Ruth O’Regan, Chair of Medicine and Charles A. Dewey Professor at the University of Rochester. ""These data found that the Breast Cancer Index test identified women who received benefit from ovarian function suppression as well as those who did not, which is incredibly important given the potential impact of this more intensive treatment approach in young women. While these data are promising, we look forward to further investigating the test’s utility to help inform ovarian function suppression treatment decisions in the future.""The landmark SOFT trial was an international, three-arm, non-blinded, randomized clinical trial of 3,066 premenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer. The trial demonstrated that the addition of OFS to five years of primary adjuvant endocrine therapy (either tamoxifen or exemestane) reduced the risk of recurrence compared to adjuvant tamoxifen alone.2 OFS typically involves hormonal drug injections with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or surgical removal of the ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy).3 In an effort to evaluate the potential of a biomarker to assist in patient selection for this more intensive approach, the new study presented at SABCS evaluated the predictive and prognostic ability of the Breast Cancer Index test in a cohort of patient tumor samples (n=1,717) from the SOFT trial. Notably, the patient characteristics in this retrospective translational study were highly representative of the original SOFT trial.Story continuesThe data found that the Breast Cancer Index genomic assay identified which premenopausal women with early-stage, HR+ breast cancer benefited from more intensive endocrine therapy (exemestane plus OFS) compared to tamoxifen alone. The Breast Cancer Index test identified 58% of women who benefited from the addition of OFS, experiencing an absolute benefit of 11.6%, compared with 42% who did not benefit (p&lt;0.01 in adjusted analysis). The data also found that the Breast Cancer Index test’s predictive performance was generally consistent across subgroups, including nodal status, prior chemotherapy, age and HER2-negative patients. Compared to the benefit shown with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone, the benefit for tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone was smaller, which is consistent with data reported from the SOFT trial itself. The study also confirmed the prognostic value of the Breast Cancer Index test, as women with higher Breast Cancer Index test risk scores were more likely to experience disease recurrence.""Multiple clinical studies and national oncology guidelines affirm the predictive ability of the Breast Cancer Index test for extended endocrine therapy,"" said Kevin Thornal, Group President, Global Diagnostic Solutions at Hologic. ""These new data further establish the Breast Cancer Index test as a significant endocrine response biomarker and reveal additional predictive capabilities of the test. As we explore its predictive power earlier in a patient’s journey, we aim to uncover broader potential clinical utility in more women with early-stage, HR+ breast cancer.""About the Breast Cancer Index TestThe Breast Cancer Index test is a molecular, gene expression-based test uniquely positioned to provide information to help physicians individualize treatment decisions for patients with early-stage, HR+ breast cancer. This breakthrough test helps oncologists and patients navigate the difficult trade-offs between taking steps to prevent recurrence of their disease and facing significant side effects and safety challenges related to unnecessary treatment. The Breast Cancer Index test has guideline designation from the American Joint Committee on Cancer for cancer staging based on molecular profile. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Group on Tumor Markers (EGTM) and St. Gallen acknowledge the Breast Cancer Index test as a biomarker to inform the chemotherapy decision; and ASCO, EGTM and the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) acknowledge the Breast Cancer Index test as a biomarker to inform the extended endocrine treatment decision.4 It is the only validated, commercially available test that predicts benefit from extended endocrine therapy. The Breast Cancer Index test is intended for routine clinical use, and treatment decisions based on results are the responsibility of the physician. It is a laboratory developed test (LDT) performed in a single CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited diagnostic laboratory and is not required to be cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

HOLX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its continued strength in the Breast Health arm. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance and its growth initiatives are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and revenues impacted by COVID-19-related uncertainties are a headwind.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 1.4% compared with 24.4% decline of the industry and 16.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of medical imaging systems and surgical products, catering to women’s healthcare needs, has a market capitalization of $18.47 billion. The company projects 15.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 46.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Breast Health: Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm over the past few months, raising our optimism. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its artificial intelligence investments and has strengthened its interventional franchise via the Brevera relaunch.In November, Hologic’s 3Dimensions mammography system was awarded EUREF Type Test certification by the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services.Growth Initiatives: We are optimistic about Hologic’s adoption of a few significant strategies over the past few years to streamline its operations and reduce the cost of revenues. The company has invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where management has recognized a good return. Hologic has launched a cadence of products, including 3DQuorum Imaging Technology, powered by Genius AI in the United States and LOCalizer radiofrequency identification tag for long-term placement in Europe.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: We are upbeat about Hologic’s better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The company saw a robust uptick in organic revenues in its GYN Surgical business as the company registered procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from the new business lines. Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Diagnostics revenues also improved on a reported basis and at a constant exchange rate.DownsidesCOVID-19 Revenue Uncertainty: Hologic is one of the key players working to produce or have produced tests for COVID-19. This may lead to customer diversion, including governmental and quasi-governmental entities, away from Hologic and toward other companies. Hologic is also witnessing a decline in its COVID-19 testing revenues following the vaccine rollout. This might significantly pull down its revenues.Stiff Competition: Hologic operates in a highly-competitive industry, where its mammography, related products and subsystems compete worldwide with products offered by several competitors. In the United States, few other key players have received the FDA’s approval for their products, which has put additional competitive pressure on Hologic.Estimate TrendHologic has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.9% south to $3.46.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $962.2 million, suggesting a 34.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Amazon is paying billions for exclusive rights for the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” on Prime Video, while Apple has inked deals for Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer on Apple TV+. But Sarandos — while he gave a caveat of “never say never” about Netflix acquiring sports rights — commented that the economics of live sports are built around pay TV and don’t make sense for streaming.“We’re not anti-sports, we’re just pro-profit,” Sarandos said. Netflix “can get twice as big without sports,” he added. Netflix already has built a large audience, he said, claiming that 165 million households watched “Squid Game” without the TV show “having to follow the Super Bowl.”Netflix — facing a rising tide of streaming competitors — lost 1.7 million subscribers in the first half of 2022 before rebounding in Q3 with a net gain of 2.4 million paid subscribers to reach 223.1 million worldwide as of the end of September.“Look, like most companies we’re happy to get 2022 behind [us],” Sarandos said at the UBS conference.Netflix is aiming to “reaccelerate revenue growth” in 2023, after the first half of this year “was pretty bumpy,” he said. One factor he cited was “unprecedented levels of competition” that has been “subsidized” — by which he meant that traditional media companies Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal are operating their direct-to-consumer businesses at a loss right now.“We’re not making that migration [from a legacy TV business],” Sarandos said. “We are profitably in the streaming business.” He referenced a comment from Bob Iger — who just returned as CEO of Disney — as saying at the Code conference in September that traditional TV “is marching to a distinct precipice, and it’s going to be pushed off.”Story continuesCompetitors “have a lot of room to grow before they catch up to us,” Sarandos added.Asked about the live Chris Rock stand-up special Netflix has set for early 2023, Sarandos said that Netflix will employ live programming for “things that are creatively benefitted by live,” like reality competition shows. “Technically there’s nothing novel about live television,” he said.Netflix, seeking to expand its addressable market, last month launched cheaper, ad-supported plans in 12 countries including the U.S., where it costs $6.99 per month (versus $9.99 for the regular Basic plan without ads). The streaming giant doesn’t expect a “material” lift in Q4 results from the new advertising play but has told investors it’s “very optimistic” about the business. At the New York Times’ DealBook conference last week, Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings conceded he was “wrong” in his previous opposition to rolling out an advertising tier and that “I wish we had flipped a few years earlier on it.”Sarandos said the ad-supported plan “opens the market up to us to that demographic” that is more price-sensitive and willing to watch commercials — a cohort that includes his son, the exec revealed. Advertising will become important as it grows and “people will pay with attention instead of a credit card,” he said. According to Sarandos, titles missing from Netflix’s ad plans (because it doesn’t have the rights to sell ads against it) represent about 10% of viewing. That “will flow off” from Netflix overall or the company will renegotiate those rights, he said; the content lineup on the ad plans will not be “complete parity but near parity.”Netflix’s ad tier also will provide a “softer landing” for consumers as the company expands its initiative to get password-sharing users to pay for separate accounts in early 2023, Sarandos said.“Here’s the good news: The folks we’re talking about all use Netflix, all love Netflix,” Sarandos said. “Now it’s about going back in and saying, ‘Hey, you’ve been on your ex’s account now you can get your own.’ … They’ll see the value in Netflix that they’re happy to have their own account.”After years of significant content-spending increases, Netflix in 2022 is shooting to spend $17 billion on programming, flat with last year. Sarandos, asked by UBS analyst John Hodulik if that was the “right number,” said, “I don’t know if it’s precisely the right number, but it’s in the right ballpark.” The key, Sarandos reiterated, is getting “more impact per billion-dollar spend than anyone else”: “We’re trying to be the best in the market… You have to have the content people love.”Netflix this year has released some of its most-watched originals to date, Sarandos said, citing “Stranger Things 4,” “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” “The Watcher,” “Purple Hearts” and “Wednesday,” the Addams Family-based series that is “chasing ‘Squid Game’ for most-watched show in the world” on Netflix, the exec said.In the decade ahead, Sarandos said, the company will focus on development, in building franchises. “Beyond people just loving content… they have to want what’s next,” he said.Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"

117,db8143fc-fa61-3ab3-bc2d-e632729f1257,NEM,2022-12-07,10 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-performing-commodity-etfs-142626655.html,1670336786,STORY,"['IVZ', 'MOS', 'NEM', 'XOM']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best performing commodity ETFs in 2022. If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022. As per a new S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence report, dated November 4, commodities prices for core metals will be hit by the macro backdrop facing the global economy through most of 2023. However, these commodities are positioned to survive the market turbulence in the long-term as they are essential for energy transition. Due to the Inflation Reduction Act being passed, the US renewable energy generation capacity is expected to increase by nearly 150GW in the next few years and global demand for electric vehicles will jump approximately 30% yearly through 2026. This means that metals including copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel will remain highly demanded. Global Commodities Outlook 2023However, the uncertain global economic environment offers a mixed commodities outlook for the year ahead. According to the BMO Capital Markets Commodity Price Index, commodity prices climbed in October after half a year of consistent declines in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Against tighter monetary and fiscal policies, BMO Economics now forecasts global growth to slow from 3.0% in 2022 to 2.3% in 2023, with multiple economies around the world facing at least mild recessions. For example, BMO Economics expects higher volatility in the energy space in the near-term, given attempts to cap Russian oil prices. Similarly, agricultural prices are impacted by uncertainty around grain exports from Ukraine and softer demand worldwide. In 2023, BMO predicts that aluminum and lumber prices will also be affected due to residential construction headwinds. Brent crude oil is forecasted to average around $100 per barrel in 2023 and peak at $110, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is expected to average $94 per barrel, as per the Bank of America. BofA also announced its latest forecast for US natural gas and noted that supply will exceed demand, pushing prices down to $4.50, while refusing Russian gas will keep liquified natural gas and coal markets tight. Story continuesBrent crude oil prices declined heavily during the third quarter of 2022, with prices in September 2022 averaging 25 percent less than their June highs. The fall in oil prices represents fears about a global recession next year, ongoing pandemic restrictions in China, and meaningful releases from different reserves. However, commodity prices remain high in several countries in domestic currency terms as their currencies have depreciated against the US dollar. Developments in coal markets have been largely influenced by rampant natural gas prices, which led many countries to transition from natural gas to coal for power generation. Additionally, the European Union’s decision to ban Russian coal also switched up trade flows, as Europe has shifted to Colombia, South Africa, the United States, and even Australia for coal imports. Food commodity prices dropped in Q3 2022 from their all-time highs in April. The plunge was a result of larger-than-anticipated edible and oilseed global supplies during the current season, the UN agreement that enabled Ukrainian grains to be sold in global markets, and slow global growth prospects. In light of the current global commodities landscape, while equities like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) often make it to investor portfolios, many individuals lean towards exchange traded funds that are managed by professionals. This minimizes portfolio risk and allows exposure to multiple asset classes which are otherwise too advanced for a layman to understand, such as futures, swaps, and other derivatives. ETF investors have benefited from a rebound in Q4 after the very challenging first three quarters of 2022. ETFs representing the primary asset classes saw positive momentum after the October inflation numbers came in lower than anticipated. ETFs represent 12% of equity assets in the US, 6.8% in Europe, and 3.8% in the Asia Pacific. In the third quarter of 2022, average daily trading volumes for US equities and US ETFs came in at $484 billion and $148.9 billion, respectively. This suggests that US ETFs represented approximately 31% of the total US composite volume in the secondary market over the quarter.10 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022Photo by Francisco Fernandes on UnsplashOur Methodology With this industry outlook in mind, we selected the following commodity ETFs based on positive share price gains year-to-date as of December 6.

So when Miller pulled over, Nemeth followed his lead.""I told Eric that I was getting my fire extinguisher and that he should get his, just in case,"" Miller recalled. ""As I put the fire out, Eric was looking to see who was in the vehicle.""It turned out to be just one young woman, yet she was trapped. Soon after the duo had stopped, another driver also pulled over and was instructed to call 911. Help from the nearby fire station arrived quickly, so Miller only had to keep the woman calm for a few minutes before the rescue team extracted her. He said she appeared shaken but otherwise fine.For the woman, things could have gotten a lot worse quickly yet Miller and Nemeth don't view themselves as heroes.""We were in the right place at the right time,"" Nemeth said.""It was just instinct and reaction,"" Miller said. ""In Gas, we deal with emergencies all day. We're trained well and we remain calm.""Indeed, Miller and Nemeth quickly put on all appropriate protective safety equipment and talked to each other about their plan of approach before putting out the fire.Trenton Gas Service Supervisor Stephanie Pangaldi said that she's proud to work with Nemeth, Miller and the many colleagues like them who care enough to support others, especially in times of need.""I commend them for stepping up and doing the right thing. Many people would freeze up and not know what to do. I'm glad that they sprang into action,"" Pangaldi said. ""All of the various trainings that our employees go through make us well prepared for almost every situation.

122,f866a5af-bc42-394a-aa01-60c5539b8d02,M,2022-12-07,RPT-COLUMN-Tin must tame its wildness to meet coming demand surge: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-column-tin-must-tame-010000975.html,1670374800,STORY,['M'],"[(Repeats Dec. 6 column without change)By Andy HomeLONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The world is going to need another 50,000 tonnes of tin per year by 2030 to meet a looming surge in demand, according to the International Tin Association (ITA).Tin is an often overlooked critical mineral, commonly associated with the humble tin can, even though packaging today accounts for only 12% of global usage. Almost half the tin consumed every year is now used as a solder in circuit boards.The faster the world moves towards the internet-of-things, the more tin will be needed to glue the expanding metaverse together.Tin will also benefit from the green energy transition thanks to its use in solar panels and batteries, both lead-acid and lithium-ion.The additional production required to feed the coming demand boom is a big ask of a sector that currently produces around 380,000 tonnes per year of primary refined metal.A recent history of extreme price volatility and growing resource nationalism in Indonesia, the world's largest tin exporter, add to the challenge.ROLLERCOASTER RIDE SLOWS...FOR NOWThe ITA estimates the tin production sector needs around $1.4 billion of investment to deliver 50,000 tonnes per year more tin by the end of the decade.It's a relatively modest amount, equivalent to around one medium-sized copper mine, but investors have in the past been wary of a market prone to extreme swings in price.This year has been a particularly wild ride, London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month tin imploding from a record high of $51,000 per tonne in March to a two-year low of $17,350 in November before bouncing to a current $24,430.Tin's spin from boom to bust is in part down to COVID-19.Key producers in Asia and South America were hit hard by lockdowns and quarantines, output at the world's top 10 operators sliding by 13% over 2020 and 2021. Demand simultaneously exploded as locked-down populations splurged on consumer electronics to pass the time.Story continuesBoth drivers have gone into reverse this year, producers lifting output just as demand for consumer goods abates.Tin users expect demand to contract by around 0.6% in 2022 after stellar growth of 7.6% last year, according to the ITA's annual survey.The shift in fundamentals, however, has been sharply accentuated by speculative flows on both London and Shanghai markets.Investment fund positioning on the LME swivelled from record long in March to record short in October, equivalent to some 20,000 tonnes of net selling, which is a lot in what is one of the exchange's less liquid contracts.Too much rather than too little liquidity is the problem in Shanghai, where volumes and market open interest surged as the price collapsed, suggesting a mass bear attack.The subsequent recovery rally has generated a lot of churn on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) tin contract with volumes hitting a record monthly high of 3.98 million lots in November. But market open interest also remains elevated at 98,474 contracts, implying the bears are largely holding their ground.Tin moved onto the investment radar in China last year with a step-change in activity on the ShFE contract. Heightened speculative activity in what remains a small physical market comes with the potential for more price turbulence.INDONESIAN UNCERTAINTYIndonesia's talk of banning exports of tin ingot injects significant fundamental uncertainty into the speculative mix.The country exported 75,000 tonnes of refined tin last year with shipments running 8% higher through the first 10 months of this year. It is the world's biggest supplier outside China.The government wants to replicate its success in the nickel sector, where a ban on exports of unprocessed ore generated a build-out of value-add processing capacity.The key difference with tin, however, is that the Indonesian authorities spent much of the last decade tightening export rules such that what leaves the country is already in high-purity refined form.A move further downstream requires more advanced technology to produce solder or tin chemicals.State producer PT Timah needs around two years to develop its existing tin chemical facility and longer to secure markets, Alwin Albar, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Tin Exporters, told a parliamentary hearing.No date for any ban or restrictions has yet been set as the government studies potential time-lines.But the threat of disruption is already impacting market dynamics with Chinese buyers trying to get ahead of any change in export rules.China imported 22,600 tonnes of refined tin in the first 10 months of the year with Indonesian metal accounting for 19,000 tonnes. That's more than China imported from Indonesia over 2020 and 2021 combined.Higher imports have helped Shanghai stocks rebuild to 4,708 tonnes from a meagre 1,260 at the start of 2022.But it's noticeable that LME inventory has started sliding again as Indonesian metal gets diverted to China. After peaking at 5,160 tonnes in September, headline LME tin stocks have fallen to 3,075 tonnes with 535 tonnes awaiting physical load-out.DESPERATELY SEEKING STABILITYNew tin projects aren't viable at a price of $18,000 per tonne. Nor is a significant amount of the artisanal mining that plays a big part in the global supply picture.But they don't need a price of $50,000 either. An ideal scenario for new projects would be a stable $25,000-30,000 range, Thomas Bünger, Chief Executive of First Tin, told the ITA's Investing in Tin seminar.Most tin producers would probably agree and the market could really do with a breather after the price swings of the last two years.Unfortunately, the combination of high speculative activity on the Shanghai market and possible disruption to Indonesian exports suggests the current calm may not last long.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters(Editing by David Evans)]"

Given that the Fed signaled that their terminal interest rate will largely track inflation, markets grew more cautious ahead of the reading.Spot gold traded around $1,770.33 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,782.35 an ounce. Both instruments are trading down for the week, as stronger-than-expected U.S. data pushed up fears of inflation remaining sticky in the country.The dollar recovered sharply from a five-month low this week, and weighed on most commodities that are priced in the greenback.The Fed is set to meet next week in its final meeting for the year. While the bank is expected to hike interest rates by a relatively smaller margin, it has warned that its benchmark rate could rise to higher-than-expected levels next year.Metal markets were battered by a sharp rise in U.S. interest rates this year, as higher yields drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.With the Fed signaling no immediate end to its rate hiking cycle, this trend is likely to continue in the near-term. Markets are awaiting more cues from the central bank next week.Still, positive signals from China helped industrial metals. Copper prices shrugged off initial losses and rose 0.7% on Tuesday, while nickel prices rallied 1.2%.Copper futures were flat around $3.8213 a pound in early Asian trade on Wednesday.Several major Chinese cities scaled back COVID-linked movement curbs and testing mandates in recent days, amid growing public ire towards the government’s strict zero-COVID policy.Story continuesWhile markets are now positioning for an eventual withdrawal of the policy, such a scenario may be delayed, given that China is experiencing its worst COVID outbreak in terms of daily infections.Still, the prospect of a Chinese reopening spurred a strong recovery in industrial metals, given that the country is one of the world’s largest commodity importers.Related ArticlesGold pinned below $1,800 as economic uncertainty, strong dollar weighOil languishes below $80 as recession fears outweigh tighter supplyUkraine appears to show ability to strike far inside Russia]"

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General DynamicsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, for US$2.5m worth of shares, at about US$228 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$248, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Gregory Gallopoulos.Gregory Gallopoulos sold a total of 21.77k shares over the year at an average price of US$233.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. General Dynamics insiders own 6.3% of the company, currently worth about US$4.3b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About General Dynamics Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the General Dynamics insiders selling.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on NextEra Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.027 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$156b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 2.7%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Electric Utilities industry average of 4.6%. Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NextEra Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NextEra Energy.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at NextEra Energy, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 5.6%, but since then they've fallen to 2.7%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.What We Can Learn From NextEra Energy's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for NextEra Energy. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 143% to shareholders in the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about NextEra Energy, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them is a bit concerning.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

138,6d923e5d-00c5-3d7f-847e-49181c4775de,NEE,2022-12-07,Wall Street Analysts See NextEra (NEE) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-nextera-173005276.html,1670347805,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about NextEra Energy (NEE).NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 80% of all recommendations.Check price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying NextEra, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NEE a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.90.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Morgan Stanley’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Mike Wilson thinks it’s time to take profits “before the Bear returns in earnest.”Wilson notes that his team’s tactical targets have been met and thinks the recent run-up has run its course. “Bear market rally runs into our original resistance levels--it's time to fade it,” says Wilson.With the “risk-reward of playing for more upside quite poor at this point,” Wilson recommends investors “stay defensively oriented (Healthcare, Utilities, Staples).”Meanwhile, Wilson’s analyst colleagues at Morgan Stanley have pointed out 3 stocks from these “defensively oriented” sectors, which should offer the portfolio some protection against incoming volatility. All have beaten the market in 2022, but the Morgan Stanley experts think investors should keep faith in them. We’ve opened the TipRanks database to see if there’s agreement regarding these names in the wider analyst community. Let’s check the results.United Therapeutics (UTHR)We'll start in the healthcare sector with United Therapeutics, a company focused mainly on developing and bringing to market drugs for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This name has done very well in 2022’s bear – up 27% year-to-date.United Therapeutics has already established its credentials with the FDA having approved five of its medicines and are all responsible for generating revenues. The treprostinil-based products (Tyvaso, Remodulin, and Orenitram) are behind most of these, and going by the recent Q3 report, PAH treatment Tyvaso looks set to become the company’s first $1 billion annual run rate product as it clocked sales of $257.7 million in the quarter.In total, the Q3 top-line haul showed $516 million, amounting to a 16% year-over-year increase and beating the Street’s call by $22.54 million. United is also profitable; EPS in Q3 reached $4.91, well above the $3.81 anticipated by the analysts.Story continuesOn the back of a 2021 label expansion for Tyvaso for the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD), Morgan Stanley’s Terence Flynn notes the company’s growth is set to accelerate from 1% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in 2018- 2021 to 10% CAGR in 2021-2024.And looking ahead, Flynn sees ""4 factors that will continue to drive growth: ongoing rollout of a new delivery device (DPI, approved in late May), Medicare coverage (went into effect on June 5), broadening the prescriber base, and expanding the drug's label to IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).”“UTHR also screens as undervalued relative to mid-cap peers,” adds Flynn, who gives an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on these shares, along with a $322 price target. Investors are looking at one-year gains of ~18%, should Flynn’s forecast go according to plan. (To watch Flynn’s track record, click here)Most of Flynn’s colleagues agree; 7 other analysts join him in the bull-camp and with an additional 1 Hold and Sell, each, the stock makes do with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. (See UTHR stock forecast on TipRanks)Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK)We'll now take a turn into staples and hit the sweet spot with sugar rush powerhouse Hostess Brands. The company is a leading sweet snack specialist with its offerings including donuts, sweet rolls, snack cakes and pies, sweet baked goods, cookies, wafers, pastries and danishes — basically whatever your sweet tooth desires. These products are sold under an array of brands such as Hostess, Donettes, Twinkies, CupCakes, Dolly Madison, Voortman, Ding Dongs and Zingers, amongst others.The packaged food segment might be a perennial underachiever, having regularly lagged the market over the past decade, but Hostess Brands investors will surely be pleased with this year’s performance. In contrast to the S&amp;P 500’s -16% display, the stock is up by 23%, a return boosted by the metrics presented in the most recent financial statement – for Q3.Hostess Brands' Q3 revenue climbed by 20% from the same period a year ago to $346.23 million while the company delivered EPS of $0.23. Both figures beat Street expectations. Even better, for the outlook, the company raised both its revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year.Evidently the company is navigating the tough economic terrain rather well, and not mincing her words when reviewing the company’s prospects, Morgan Stanley analyst Pamela Kaufman calls TWNK “our Top Pick in Packaged Food.”“Q3 results demonstrate that TWNK's strong execution, driven by its innovation, marketing, and data analytics is positioning the company to deliver another year of double-digit topline growth following 11.6% growth last year,” the analyst explained. “We believe the company is positioned to sustain an attractive 2021-24 CAGR of 10.4% topline and 12.2% EPS supported by: i) attractive sweet baked goods category growth; ii) success around innovation (Baby Bundts Cakes, Boost, Bouncers) and marketing, including TWNK's first digital campaign; iii) solid growth across channels; and iv) Voortman upside potential from distribution growth and innovation.”Underpinning these comments with an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating and $30 price target, Kaufman sees the shares delivering returns of 19% over the next year. (To watch Kaufman’s track record, click here)Most on the Street are thinking along the same lines; barring one skeptic, all 5 other reviews are positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See TWNK stock forecast on TipRanks)NextEra Energy (NEE)Last amongst the Morgan Stanley-endorsed defensive stocks is electric utility play NextEra Energy, which happens to be the U.S.’s biggest renewable energy company by market cap.This $169 billion behemoth provides electricity to millions of people in the US. Largest utility by market cap aside, subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources is also the biggest operator of wind and solar projects in the world. NextEra also produces electricity from other sources, primarily nuclear and natural gas.The company’s footprint spans across vast swathes of the country (and parts of Canada too), although the bulk of operations are concentrated in three areas: Florida, California and the East Coast.In its latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, NextEra generated revenue of $6.72 billion, a 54% year-over-year increase and trumping the analysts’ expectations by $950 million. Likewise on the bottom-line, adj. EPS came in at $0.85, above the $0.80 consensus estimate.Further boosting its defensive credentials, the company also pays a dividend. The quarterly payout currently stands at $0.42, which annualizes to $1.68 and yields 2%. While that is below the sector average, the payout has been steadily increasing over the past few years.Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro notes the solid Q3 showing and highlights the company’s excellent positioning.“NEE reported strong 3Q results: Robust renewables backlog growth, likely earnings upside from IRA, and lower interest rate exposure than expected… NextEra is highly confident in executing against the 28-37 GW renewable development program in 2022-2025, an outlook that was set before the passage of the IRA. This project sets an EPS growth outlook of up to 8% through 2025, an already-attractive rate relative to the broader utility space and one we see as highly achievable,” Arcaro wrote.To this end, Arcaro gives NextEra shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $95 price target implies one-year share appreciation of ~12%. (To watch Arcaro’s track record, click here)Wall Street is generally confident regarding NextEra’s prospects. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 9 Buys vs. just one Hold.

If you want to skip our analysis of the hardware industry and explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now.The hardware and tools industry is an important part of the global economy. It includes the production of tools, machinery, and other related products used in the manufacturing, construction, and maintenance sectors. The industry is diverse and encompasses a variety of products, from hand tools to power tools, garden tools, and other products. The hardware and tools industry is reliant on the manufacturing and construction industries, as the tools and machinery produced are used in these industries. Demand for these products is determined by the size of the projects being undertaken, and the amount of work that needs to be done. As such, the industry is highly cyclical and can be heavily affected by economic changes. The industry has seen significant growth in recent years, due to the increasing demand for construction and manufacturing. This has been driven by population growth, urbanization, and the need for more efficient and cost-effective products. In addition, the growth of the digital economy has led to more demand for digital tools and machines, such as 3D printers and CNC machines. The industry is highly competitive, with companies competing to produce the highest quality tools and products at the lowest costs. In order to remain competitive, companies must constantly innovate and develop new products to keep up with changing consumer preferences. The Hardware Industry: An AnalysisAccording to an industry analysis report by The Business Research Company, the global hardware market was valued at $100.21 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach a value of $109.05 billion by the end of 2022, registering a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%. The global hardware market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% from 2022 through 2026, and reach a valuation of $136.34 billion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe report highlighted that favorable demand trends for metal, and aluminum in particular, coming from the growth of the aerospace industry, are one of the major driving forces fueling the growth of the global hardware industry. Air travel is expected to increase over the forecasted period, therefore driving the demand for metal and consequently the growth of the global hardware industry. However, a potential headwind for the global hardware market is the current geopolitical state of affairs, which has resulted in supply disruptions and a surge in commodity prices. The Ukraine war has caused demand destruction across the globe and is a major hurdle in the growth of the global hardware market as of yet.A key trend that is disrupting the global hardware industry is the rising adoption of industrial automation and the use of robotics in manufacturing to make the process more efficient. Robots can now be used to automate many of the more tedious and time-consuming tasks, such as drilling and grinding, allowing companies to produce more products at a faster rate.Hardware and tools stocks include companies that manufacture, distribute, and sell hardware and tools used in residential and commercial construction, manufacturing, and repair and maintenance. These stocks can offer investors the potential for growth and income, as well as exposure to a wide range of industries. Hardware and tools stocks can provide investors with exposure to the construction and home improvement industries, which tend to be cyclical in nature and highly dependent on the overall economy. In times of economic expansion, demand for hardware and tools typically increases, leading to higher stock prices. Conversely, during periods of economic contraction, demand for these products typically decreases, resulting in lower stock prices.  This piece is dedicated to exploring some of the best hardware stocks to buy now, for investors that have the risk-tolerance to ride out near-term uncertainty.Some of the most popular hardware and tool stocks among elite money managers include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT).

Many of us first encountered The Toro Company in the rite of passage when our parents finally relented in allowing us to cut the grass for the first time when we were barely taller than the lawn mower handle. From the Company’s humble beginning building tractor engines for the Bull Tractor Company in Bloomington, Milwaukee, the Company has methodically grown into the diversified conglomerate of today that today possesses industry leading brand awareness, market share, technological prowess, and profitability.We are always enamored with a company’s beginnings, so herewith is the short story of The Toro Corporation’s storied history. The “Toro” name was chosen given its first relationship with The Bull Tractor Company, which according to Company documents was the #1 brand of farm tractors in 1914.

Timken Co. is a manufacturer of engineered bearings used in rotating motion equipment and related power transmission products. Its products are mission critical, have a high cost of failure, and only a relatively small cost to the customer. The company was spun out of Timken Steel in 2014, and since that time, the business has improved generating higher growth, higher margins, better positioning within end markets, and improved free cash flow. We think Timken’s scale along with its engineering abilities and technical expertise create high barriers to entry for competitors. Timken’s leadership team has significant ownership of the company, solid management incentives aligned with shareholder interests, and in our estimation are intelligent capital allocators. We have owned Timken in the past, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to own the company again.”8. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.

Of those, Harris Associates was the top shareholder in the company and held a position worth $251.7 million.Here is what Oakmark Funds had to say about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is failing to properly reward Masco (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products, for the significant upgrade of its business mix over the past decade. Having previously sold its more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation, windows, and cabinets, what remains are some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products-primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)-are more resilient, lower ticket, and higher margin categories. Both segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit strong pricing power and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair and remodel market. Despite its greatly improved business mix, Masco trades for just 10x next year’s expected earnings, which is a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”6.

As of September 30, Ariel Investments is the dominant investor in the company and has a position worth $146.48 million.Here is what Heartland Advisors had to say about Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Snap-on Inc. (NYSE:SNA) represents a typical holding in that its recent earnings performance, which easily topped analyst expectations, underscored the company’s ability to pass on higher costs to customers. Based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on designs and manufactures professional-grade tools with a particular focus on the automotive-repair industry.While the company was a top performer in the portfolio during the quarter, we believe its current valuation – trading at 12x earnings – leaves plenty of room to run. By comparison, peers trade at 15x earnings even though Snap-on has better margins and operates with less leverage than its competitors.Meanwhile, several secular tailwinds, including an aging fleet of used cars and ever-increasing vehicle complexity, should prove beneficial to Snap-on’s business over the longer term. Snap-on’s history of distributing dividends, which has grown at a 7% CAGR over the past 35 years, underscores its financial discipline and is an added appeal.Like  Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is a hardware stock that is popular among elite hedge funds today. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:14 Best Environmental Stocks To Buy12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy10 Best Gold Stocks with DividendsDisclosure: None. 11 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of Aya Gold &amp; Silver Inc. (TSE:AYA), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Aya Gold &amp; Silver The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Aya Gold &amp; SilverIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman of the Board Robert Taub bought CA$433k worth of shares at a price of CA$7.21 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of CA$8.26. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 151.10k shares for CA$1.1m. But they sold 73.60k shares for CA$725k. In total, Aya Gold &amp; Silver insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 15% of Aya Gold &amp; Silver shares, worth about CA$132m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Aya Gold &amp; Silver Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Aya Gold &amp; Silver shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Aya Gold &amp; Silver insiders think the business has merit.

149,f866a5af-bc42-394a-aa01-60c5539b8d02,MA,2022-12-07,RPT-COLUMN-Tin must tame its wildness to meet coming demand surge: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-column-tin-must-tame-010000975.html,1670374800,STORY,['HG=F'],"[(Repeats Dec. 6 column without change)By Andy HomeLONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The world is going to need another 50,000 tonnes of tin per year by 2030 to meet a looming surge in demand, according to the International Tin Association (ITA).Tin is an often overlooked critical mineral, commonly associated with the humble tin can, even though packaging today accounts for only 12% of global usage. Almost half the tin consumed every year is now used as a solder in circuit boards.The faster the world moves towards the internet-of-things, the more tin will be needed to glue the expanding metaverse together.Tin will also benefit from the green energy transition thanks to its use in solar panels and batteries, both lead-acid and lithium-ion.The additional production required to feed the coming demand boom is a big ask of a sector that currently produces around 380,000 tonnes per year of primary refined metal.A recent history of extreme price volatility and growing resource nationalism in Indonesia, the world's largest tin exporter, add to the challenge.ROLLERCOASTER RIDE SLOWS...FOR NOWThe ITA estimates the tin production sector needs around $1.4 billion of investment to deliver 50,000 tonnes per year more tin by the end of the decade.It's a relatively modest amount, equivalent to around one medium-sized copper mine, but investors have in the past been wary of a market prone to extreme swings in price.This year has been a particularly wild ride, London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month tin imploding from a record high of $51,000 per tonne in March to a two-year low of $17,350 in November before bouncing to a current $24,430.Tin's spin from boom to bust is in part down to COVID-19.Key producers in Asia and South America were hit hard by lockdowns and quarantines, output at the world's top 10 operators sliding by 13% over 2020 and 2021. Demand simultaneously exploded as locked-down populations splurged on consumer electronics to pass the time.Story continuesBoth drivers have gone into reverse this year, producers lifting output just as demand for consumer goods abates.Tin users expect demand to contract by around 0.6% in 2022 after stellar growth of 7.6% last year, according to the ITA's annual survey.The shift in fundamentals, however, has been sharply accentuated by speculative flows on both London and Shanghai markets.Investment fund positioning on the LME swivelled from record long in March to record short in October, equivalent to some 20,000 tonnes of net selling, which is a lot in what is one of the exchange's less liquid contracts.Too much rather than too little liquidity is the problem in Shanghai, where volumes and market open interest surged as the price collapsed, suggesting a mass bear attack.The subsequent recovery rally has generated a lot of churn on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) tin contract with volumes hitting a record monthly high of 3.98 million lots in November. But market open interest also remains elevated at 98,474 contracts, implying the bears are largely holding their ground.Tin moved onto the investment radar in China last year with a step-change in activity on the ShFE contract. Heightened speculative activity in what remains a small physical market comes with the potential for more price turbulence.INDONESIAN UNCERTAINTYIndonesia's talk of banning exports of tin ingot injects significant fundamental uncertainty into the speculative mix.The country exported 75,000 tonnes of refined tin last year with shipments running 8% higher through the first 10 months of this year. It is the world's biggest supplier outside China.The government wants to replicate its success in the nickel sector, where a ban on exports of unprocessed ore generated a build-out of value-add processing capacity.The key difference with tin, however, is that the Indonesian authorities spent much of the last decade tightening export rules such that what leaves the country is already in high-purity refined form.A move further downstream requires more advanced technology to produce solder or tin chemicals.State producer PT Timah needs around two years to develop its existing tin chemical facility and longer to secure markets, Alwin Albar, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Tin Exporters, told a parliamentary hearing.No date for any ban or restrictions has yet been set as the government studies potential time-lines.But the threat of disruption is already impacting market dynamics with Chinese buyers trying to get ahead of any change in export rules.China imported 22,600 tonnes of refined tin in the first 10 months of the year with Indonesian metal accounting for 19,000 tonnes. That's more than China imported from Indonesia over 2020 and 2021 combined.Higher imports have helped Shanghai stocks rebuild to 4,708 tonnes from a meagre 1,260 at the start of 2022.But it's noticeable that LME inventory has started sliding again as Indonesian metal gets diverted to China. After peaking at 5,160 tonnes in September, headline LME tin stocks have fallen to 3,075 tonnes with 535 tonnes awaiting physical load-out.DESPERATELY SEEKING STABILITYNew tin projects aren't viable at a price of $18,000 per tonne. Nor is a significant amount of the artisanal mining that plays a big part in the global supply picture.But they don't need a price of $50,000 either. An ideal scenario for new projects would be a stable $25,000-30,000 range, Thomas Bünger, Chief Executive of First Tin, told the ITA's Investing in Tin seminar.Most tin producers would probably agree and the market could really do with a breather after the price swings of the last two years.Unfortunately, the combination of high speculative activity on the Shanghai market and possible disruption to Indonesian exports suggests the current calm may not last long.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters(Editing by David Evans)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the free market as it pertains to ethical conduct in the US and go directly to 5 Most Ethical Companies in the US. Young people are becoming increasingly awake to the social, historical, climate and financial injustices and choose to give business to, and invest in companies that share their values. Many corporations have responded positively to the development. “Ethical” CapitalismTo give you a quantitative perspective on the corporate ethical turn, Yale School of Management has compiled a list of 138 corporations with extended women’s benefits, not offered by other corporations. Out of these, nearly a third are tech corporations. The most prominent ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In terms of doing business in Russia, over a 1,000 corporations (majority of them American) have left the country after it invaded the neighboring Ukraine. Evidence indicates that the equity market’s reward to the companies for the action far outweighs the potential loss from leaving Russia. On the other hand, companies that are still engaged in business with Russia are being punished by investors. At the sustainability front, many companies have adopted “planet friendly” policies to lower the burden on Earth’s ecosystem and climate. However, most of the corporate sector has been called out several times for “greenwashing” and not actually doing enough. Regardless, the companies we’ve discussed are doing their part for sustainability as well as social and financial justice. ESG’s Impact on a Company’s Financial PerformanceESG refers to the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. It's a set of standards that impact-investors look at when investing based on values. Stern School of Business carried out a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, done between the period of 2015-2020, and concluded that ESG and corporate financial performance had a statistically significant positive correlation for 58% of the studies. The analysis also discovered that corporate investments in sustainability were actually advantageous in the long-term while having no impact on financial performance in the short-term.Story continuesNow that we have the perspective on the ethical free market, let’s move on to the list of 22 most ethical companies in the US. 22 Most Ethical Companies in the USPhoto by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 22 most ethical companies in the US, we’ve ranked them based on how many times they’ve been hailed as honorees for being ethical up until 2022 by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in assessing ethical businesses.We’ve also mentioned each company’s ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a premier ESG grader.

In this series, we're talking with some of Qualcomm's most prolific inventors about their work, the impact of their inventions, and their inspiration.Do you call friends and family on your smartphone? Scroll through social media when you're in the checkout line at the grocery store? Watch YouTube while riding the train to work? If the answer is yes, you have Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. inventor Dr. Xiaoxia Zhang to thank, whose work helped make all that (and more) possible.Dr. Zhang joined Qualcomm after completing her PhD in electrical engineering at Ohio State University in 2002. She's worked on key aspects of 3G, 4G, and 5G system design, and now, as our Senior Director of Technology, she's leading research projects in industrial IoT development, shared/unlicensed spectrum, and RAN disaggregation on 5G technology. With more than 2,500 granted patents, she's one of Qualcomm's most prolific inventors.We recently caught up with Dr. Zhang to discuss her thoughts on the culture of innovation at Qualcomm, her work in 3G/4G/5G, and her current project in industrial IoT.The following interview has been edited for clarity and length.Did you always know you wanted to be an inventor? If not, what or who inspired you?I didn't know I wanted to be an inventor before I joined Qualcomm, but the culture here was, and continues to be, a huge inspiration. When I started at the company, we were at the tail end of working on 3G and were transitioning to 4G. During that time, I got to work with&amp; Durga Malladi, who is now Qualcomm Technologies Senior Vice President &amp; General Manager for Cellular Modems &amp; Infrastructure. He was my lead and gave me great guidance and support; I learned a lot from him by observing how he does things. That helped me hone my own instinct for finding problems and coming up with ideas to solve them.Your work has centered around the different protocols that phones and other devices use to talk to the cell network. Can you explain how this works?Modern wireless communications involving many different devices with varied usage scenarios are quite complex. Let me provide a high-level, general analogy describing how devices talk. To talk to a cell tower, your phone first needs to send what's called a scheduling request. Think of the cell tower like a teacher in a busy classroom full of students, and you're a student raising your hand with something to say. The tower hears your request, and tells when and where you can send the data and for how long - like a teacher calling on students in order based on their request. The tower also asks your phone what the channel state is like - basically how good the cell environment is around you, how clearly the signal can be sent back and forth - and then an acknowledgment feedback, which asks your phone how well it's hearing and understanding the information sent.Story continuesThese three signals are required for each connection in order to optimize all the different conversations going on in the network - but it can be really inefficient to always separately send each signal one at a time from each phone. So, to help solve these complex communications challenges, I came up with an idea called ""simultaneous transmission joint coding"", where you encode the signals simultaneously to have critical information transmit at the same time and make the system's operation as efficient as possible. This system enables your phone to connect to the network, and quickly and efficiently share the massive amounts of data we use for video calls, streaming, web browsing, etc., and was a really fundamental technique that went into the core of 4G and now 5G.You're currently leading Qualcomm's project focusing on industrial IoT. Can you tell us a bit about what this work entails and the goal of the project?Right now, most industries are relying heavily on wired connections - especially in areas like factories. They have wires everywhere, and those wires make it difficult to upgrade the system each time you need to adjust or change your factory line or make a new product. We're working to make 5G connectivity as strong as wired connectivity in industrial applications - with ultra-reliability and low latency - and the added benefit of more flexibility and easier redeployments on factory floors. Really cutting-edge stuff.Looking ahead to 6G, what is something you're most excited about?In early 6G talks, people are discussing different use cases that may have already started in 5G and could be enhanced in 6G. For example, figuring out ways to use the network to actually give you real-time data on what's around you. This could really help factories to quickly determine the layout of their machines or assembly line. So much of wireless research is like this: you iterate and improve on what's been done to meet new demands and grow capabilities.You started at Qualcomm right after you finished your PhD in 2002. How has being an inventor changed?I think the biggest difference is what we're trying to achieve with the technologies we're working on. In the beginning, 3G and 4G were the backbone of getting phone protocols and networks to work. When we moved to 5G, we saw how it is expanding into multiple vertical domains - the introduction of using unlicensed spectrum, industrial IoT use cases, etc. It's no longer about just establishing phone protocols; there are now so many use cases and problems for people to solve.What advice would you give to other inventors?Have sharp eyes to identify problems and discuss it with others. Talking it out helps you clear your mind; plus, others may offer insight that gives you a more comprehensive understanding of the problem. And most of all, you need to have a good team to work with if you're going to be a good inventor. It's all about solving problems - and doing it together.Learn more about innovation at QualcommRead more about other inventors at QualcommQualcomm, Tuesday, December 6, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.qualcomm.com/company/sustainability Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730564/Qualcomm-Inventor-Dr-Xiaoxia-Zhang-on-How-Your-Phone-Finds-the-Time-to-Talk-to-Cell-Towers-in-5G]"

INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”7.

158,cd0179e7-2da8-3912-a840-6b15ecfaa213,LMT,2022-12-07,Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 76% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporation-nyse-lmt-120028437.html,1670414428,STORY,['LMT'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lockheed Martin. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Lockheed Martin already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Lockheed Martin's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with ownership of 15%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.6% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$85m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Lockheed Martin. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +12.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 11.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.9%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.05 indicates a change of -30.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $15.66 billion and $14.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.5% and -7.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of high-dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Very High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The soaring inflation and consistent interest rates hike have analysts worried about a full-blown recession in the next few months. According to Bankrate’s third-quarter survey, 65% of economists believe that the US economy could contract within the next 12 to 18 months. The estimates have grown significantly since the first quarter when 33% of the candidates surveyed expected a recession. This uncertain market situation has pushed investors toward high-yield dividend securities.High-yield dividend stocks have shown strong performance over other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. According to a report by Franklin Templeton Investments, an American multinational capital markets company, the ICE BofA US High Yield Index outperformed the broader market by 9 percentage points during and after the early 1990s and by 13 percentage points in the early 2000s. The report also mentioned that high-yield stocks remain resilient during periods of economic downturns, whereas earnings tend to decline during a recession. Another report by JPMorgan mentioned that earnings-per-share suffered a harsh decline during recessionary periods when dividends remained stable.According to analysts, dividend stocks with healthy yields can pull investors out of the gloomy market and provide profits on their investments. Dividend stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are grabbing attention this year because these companies have raised their payouts for decades and generated stable income for investors.However, we will discuss very high-yield dividend stocks in this article.Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below pay dividends to shareholders and have yields above 13%, as of December 5.

If you want to read about some more undervalued UK stocks, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued UK Stocks to Buy Now.The United Kingdom economy has been in turmoil as a result of the separation from the European Union, political instability, high inflation, and slow growth across the globe. Investors are thus hesitant to invest in companies based in the country. However, there are many undervalued stocks in the UK market that offer significant growth potential at bargain prices and have pricing power to weather the macro conditions. UK markets are expected to go through a significant multi-year fiscal tightening plan in the next few years. This tightening will amount to around £70 billion, 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), by 2025. These predictions have forced investment advisors like JP Morgan to revise their UK growth forecasts by assuming a further 0.2 percentage point drag in the fourth quarter of 2022, taking the hit from over the next year closer to 0.8%. One of the major market indicators in the UK is the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, a major stock market index which tracks the performance of 100 most capitalized companies traded on the London Stock Exchange. FTSE 100 companies represent about 80 percent of the entire market capitalization of the London Stock Exchange. It is a free-float index. The index recently hit a low of 7,500 points after a stronger-than-expected US jobs report dashed some hopes of a policy pivot in the UK. However, it recovered some ground amid a rebound in heavyweight value shares, mimicking the performance of US-based solid companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). In November 2022, the export-oriented index rallied almost 7%, the best monthly performance since November 2020, igniting hopes of a recovery. The yield on the UK’s 10-year government bond, also called gilt, fluttered around 3.1% at the start of December, remaining close to its lowest level since early September. Recently, the deputy governor of the Bank of England backed more interest rate hikes but clarified the government would consider cutting rates if the economy developed differently to expectations. Story continuesOther economic experts in the UK have also predicted that rates are likely to rise this year, be on hold the next year, and will then start falling in 2024. In order to sum up, the markets are betting on a 50 to 75 bps increase at the next December meeting of the central bank. Investors can take advantage of this temporary slowdown in the UK market to pick up shares of undervalued firms at discount prices. Since these firms have established businesses, their shares are most likely to rally in the coming months as the economy recovers. However, there is reason to proceed with caution in this regard. According to the central bank, although the economy might technically avoid a recession, it would still shrink by around 0.25% through 2023. The unemployment rate in the next few months is also likely to rise to around 5.5%. Per the central bank, households might see the biggest squeeze to their incomes since records started being kept in 1964. Energy prices are also set to rise further in Europe as the Russian invasion of Ukraine prolongs. As a result of higher inflation, the government in the UK is also under pressure to raise taxes on oil and gas firms, which have seen profits surge due to rising energy prices. These taxes are meant to fund measures aimed at helping families with low incomes during the coming economic crisis. Supply disruptions due to the virus crisis in China and the Ukraine war have also contributed to the rise in inflation over the past few months in the UK. Inflation is now at its highest levels in the country since 1982. However, there is reason to proceed with caution in this regard. According to the central bank, although the economy might technically avoid a recession, it would still shrink by around 0.25% through 2023. The unemployment rate in the next few months is also likely to rise to around 5.5%. Per the central bank, households might see the biggest squeeze to their incomes since records started being kept in 1964. Energy prices are also set to rise further in Europe as the Russian invasion of Ukraine prolongs. Our MethodologyThe firms based in the United Kingdom were selected for the list.

(NYSE:MRK) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 76%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-nyse-mrk-110048403.html,1670410848,STORY,['MRK'],"[If you want to know who really controls Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Merck. Check out our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Merck does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Merck, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Merck. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. With 8.5% and 4.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$175m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Merck   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

175,db8143fc-fa61-3ab3-bc2d-e632729f1257,MOS,2022-12-07,10 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-performing-commodity-etfs-142626655.html,1670336786,STORY,"['IVZ', 'MOS', 'NEM', 'XOM']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best performing commodity ETFs in 2022. If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022. As per a new S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence report, dated November 4, commodities prices for core metals will be hit by the macro backdrop facing the global economy through most of 2023. However, these commodities are positioned to survive the market turbulence in the long-term as they are essential for energy transition. Due to the Inflation Reduction Act being passed, the US renewable energy generation capacity is expected to increase by nearly 150GW in the next few years and global demand for electric vehicles will jump approximately 30% yearly through 2026. This means that metals including copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel will remain highly demanded. Global Commodities Outlook 2023However, the uncertain global economic environment offers a mixed commodities outlook for the year ahead. According to the BMO Capital Markets Commodity Price Index, commodity prices climbed in October after half a year of consistent declines in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Against tighter monetary and fiscal policies, BMO Economics now forecasts global growth to slow from 3.0% in 2022 to 2.3% in 2023, with multiple economies around the world facing at least mild recessions. For example, BMO Economics expects higher volatility in the energy space in the near-term, given attempts to cap Russian oil prices. Similarly, agricultural prices are impacted by uncertainty around grain exports from Ukraine and softer demand worldwide. In 2023, BMO predicts that aluminum and lumber prices will also be affected due to residential construction headwinds. Brent crude oil is forecasted to average around $100 per barrel in 2023 and peak at $110, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is expected to average $94 per barrel, as per the Bank of America. BofA also announced its latest forecast for US natural gas and noted that supply will exceed demand, pushing prices down to $4.50, while refusing Russian gas will keep liquified natural gas and coal markets tight. Story continuesBrent crude oil prices declined heavily during the third quarter of 2022, with prices in September 2022 averaging 25 percent less than their June highs. The fall in oil prices represents fears about a global recession next year, ongoing pandemic restrictions in China, and meaningful releases from different reserves. However, commodity prices remain high in several countries in domestic currency terms as their currencies have depreciated against the US dollar. Developments in coal markets have been largely influenced by rampant natural gas prices, which led many countries to transition from natural gas to coal for power generation. Additionally, the European Union’s decision to ban Russian coal also switched up trade flows, as Europe has shifted to Colombia, South Africa, the United States, and even Australia for coal imports. Food commodity prices dropped in Q3 2022 from their all-time highs in April. The plunge was a result of larger-than-anticipated edible and oilseed global supplies during the current season, the UN agreement that enabled Ukrainian grains to be sold in global markets, and slow global growth prospects. In light of the current global commodities landscape, while equities like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) often make it to investor portfolios, many individuals lean towards exchange traded funds that are managed by professionals. This minimizes portfolio risk and allows exposure to multiple asset classes which are otherwise too advanced for a layman to understand, such as futures, swaps, and other derivatives. ETF investors have benefited from a rebound in Q4 after the very challenging first three quarters of 2022. ETFs representing the primary asset classes saw positive momentum after the October inflation numbers came in lower than anticipated. ETFs represent 12% of equity assets in the US, 6.8% in Europe, and 3.8% in the Asia Pacific. In the third quarter of 2022, average daily trading volumes for US equities and US ETFs came in at $484 billion and $148.9 billion, respectively. This suggests that US ETFs represented approximately 31% of the total US composite volume in the secondary market over the quarter.10 Best Performing Commodity ETFs in 2022Photo by Francisco Fernandes on UnsplashOur Methodology With this industry outlook in mind, we selected the following commodity ETFs based on positive share price gains year-to-date as of December 6.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the free market as it pertains to ethical conduct in the US and go directly to 5 Most Ethical Companies in the US. Young people are becoming increasingly awake to the social, historical, climate and financial injustices and choose to give business to, and invest in companies that share their values. Many corporations have responded positively to the development. “Ethical” CapitalismTo give you a quantitative perspective on the corporate ethical turn, Yale School of Management has compiled a list of 138 corporations with extended women’s benefits, not offered by other corporations. Out of these, nearly a third are tech corporations. The most prominent ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In terms of doing business in Russia, over a 1,000 corporations (majority of them American) have left the country after it invaded the neighboring Ukraine. Evidence indicates that the equity market’s reward to the companies for the action far outweighs the potential loss from leaving Russia. On the other hand, companies that are still engaged in business with Russia are being punished by investors. At the sustainability front, many companies have adopted “planet friendly” policies to lower the burden on Earth’s ecosystem and climate. However, most of the corporate sector has been called out several times for “greenwashing” and not actually doing enough. Regardless, the companies we’ve discussed are doing their part for sustainability as well as social and financial justice. ESG’s Impact on a Company’s Financial PerformanceESG refers to the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. It's a set of standards that impact-investors look at when investing based on values. Stern School of Business carried out a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, done between the period of 2015-2020, and concluded that ESG and corporate financial performance had a statistically significant positive correlation for 58% of the studies. The analysis also discovered that corporate investments in sustainability were actually advantageous in the long-term while having no impact on financial performance in the short-term.Story continuesNow that we have the perspective on the ethical free market, let’s move on to the list of 22 most ethical companies in the US. 22 Most Ethical Companies in the USPhoto by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 22 most ethical companies in the US, we’ve ranked them based on how many times they’ve been hailed as honorees for being ethical up until 2022 by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in assessing ethical businesses.We’ve also mentioned each company’s ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a premier ESG grader. Sustainalytics’ ESG-risk metric measures the risk to a company's financial value due to the disregard of ESG factors. It assigns quantitative risk scores between 0 and 50 to corporations and based on the scores, it classifies them into any of the five risk categories: Negligible (0-10) Low (10-20), Medium (20-30), High (30-40), and Severe (40-50).22.

It added that the final figure is now not expected to fall ""materially short"" of ""around 700,"" but did not provide a specific total.Airbus said the decision was based on its November deliveries, which came in at 68. According to Reuters, suppliers had penciled in an industrial planning target for the month of 80.The delivery number for the year to November was 563 after adjusting for the cancellation of two planes due to international sanctions slapped on Russia, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine earlier this year.The European aerospace giant also warned that it is facing a ""complex operating environment."" Analysts have noted that Airbus, as well as major rival Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), have faced delays from supply chain disruptions throughout 2022.Airbus still expects to hit its interim production target of 65 A320 family jets but changed the timeframe for this goal to between 2023-2024. The company had aimed to reach 65 by early 2024 after moving back its scheduled goal of mid-2023 earlier this year because of supply issues.However, Airbus maintained its guidance for both adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and free cash flow.Analysts at Deutsche Bank called Airbus' financial outlook ""conservative"" and a justification for the slight adjustment in their price target for the stock down to €130 per share from €133. Jefferies analysts also slashed their price target to €132 per share.Meanwhile, Citi analysts maintained their €171 per share price target and ""Buy"" rating for Airbus, saying that the updated delivery timetable is a ""minor delay"" that minimally impacts the group's value.Story continuesRelated ArticlesAirbus shares slip after jet maker lowers annual delivery targetFactbox-European companies cuts jobs as economy sputtersSouthwest Airlines reinstates quarterly dividend]"

The decision coming after they produced this for just around 50 years.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, the end of an era, the iconic Jumbo jet, the widebody. When I was a kid, I'd see these planes at the airport, enjoyed flying on them. But now 50 years is a long time in the industry. The final one tonight rolls off the line in Everett, Washington. It's for an air cargo company, which they've been doing a lot of for that 747. It's not so popular for consumer commercial air travel these days.But back in the '70s, '80s, this sort of brought international travel to many people. This plane could go 8,000 nautical miles, fly 400-- transfer 400 passengers in each flight. This was a big deal back in those days. So it's sort of sad to see the plane go, but Boeing is sort of looking to the future with the 777x widebody jet. Unfortunately, it's been delayed for a couple of years with some new kind of improvements they've added, so that's sort of a downer for the stock.

The coalition will respond to the recently announced funding opportunity from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which includes $8 billion for regional hydrogen hubs and is part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).Other members of the Southeast Hydrogen Hub coalition will include a growing list of hydrogen users from a variety of industries in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The coalition expects its membership to grow as news of the opportunity spreads and as interest in hydrogen intensifies.A hydrogen hub in the Southeastern U.S. is expected to bring robust economic development benefits to the region, and hydrogen is attractive as an energy resource because it has immediate potential to accelerate decarbonization in the Southeast and across all sectors of the U.S. economy - including transportation, which generates the largest share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the country.Hydrogen also is a dispatchable energy source, meaning it can be turned on or off as needed, enabling power companies to add more intermittent renewable resources to the energy system. Hydrogen may be poised to play a major role in addressing climate change and could be essential for each coalition member to meet its stated carbon-reduction goals:Dominion Energy: Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for all electric and natural gas operations by 2050.Duke Energy: Achieve net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. The company has interim carbon emissions targets of at least 50% reduction from electric generation by 2030 and 80% reduction by 2040.Louisville Gas and Electric Company &amp; Kentucky Utilities Company: Along with parent company, PPL, LG&amp;E and KU has set a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with interim reduction targets of 70% from 2010 levels by 2035 and 80% by 2040.Southern Company: Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across electric and natural gas operations by 2050.TVA: Achieve 70% carbon reduction by 2030 and approximately 80% carbon reduction by 2035. Aspire to net-zero by 2050.Story continuesBy working together, the coalition can focus on developing scalable, integrated projects at key locations across the entire Southeast in support of these carbon-reduction goals and encourage the broad-based development of a regional energy ecosystem that will allow members to deploy hydrogen as a decarbonization solution for customers and communities.""Hydrogen will play an important role in our region's clean energy transition and Dominion Energy's path to net-zero emissions,"" said Mark Webb, chief innovation officer of Dominion Energy. ""From electricity and home heating to transportation and manufacturing, hydrogen will bring jobs, investment and clean energy to every sector of the Southeast U.S. economy. We're excited to partner with all the members of the Southeast Hydrogen Hub coalition to deliver on this promise for our customers and the communities we serve.""""Duke Energy is excited to work with our peers to explore this funding opportunity, which is vital to our industry-leading clean energy transformation for our customers and our communities,"" said Swati Daji, Duke Energy senior vice president of enterprise strategy and planning. ""A Southeast hydrogen hub will provide economic and workforce-development benefits that will extend well beyond the timeline for these projects. We are pleased to have Battelle's leadership and experience on our side as we work together with the coalition to make this hub a reality.""""LG&amp;E and KU's mission is to provide safe, reliable, sustainable, competitively priced energy to our customers,"" said John Crockett, president of LG&amp;E and KU. ""Advancing a cleaner energy future is one of the core commitments of our sustainability strategy and we will continue to leverage our partnerships with industry, universities and national research institutions, to achieve our goals.""""Southern Company views hydrogen as a powerful opportunity to provide an energy system that is abundant, affordable, reliable and resilient in a net-zero future,"" said Chris Cummiskey, executive vice president, chief commercial officer and customer solutions officer, Southern Company. ""With the nation's leading utilities forming a solid, customer-centered foundation, the Southeast Hydrogen Hub promises to become a new catalyst for economic development and growth, while bringing broad, economywide decarbonization to the customers and communities we serve.""""TVA is committed to our mission of service that makes life better for the people we serve,"" said Dr. Joe Hoagland, vice president, TVA Innovation &amp; Research.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Cigna's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:15% = US$6.7b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 15% ROETo start with, Cigna's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 23% seen over the past five years by Cigna. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 16%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Cigna Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Cigna's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 4.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (96%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Cigna has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Cigna's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

The biosimilars, approved by the FDA, are prescription medications that are quite affordable, safe to consume and have proved to be effective.Thus, the biosimilars can be considered as clinical substitutes for Humira that caters to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis and is one of the most commonly used biologic specialty medications to treat such diseases.The decision to extend the latest pharmacy benefit in the form of biosimilars reflects Cigna’s continuous efforts to bring substantial cost savings as well as increased choices for its clients who want to avail specialty medications.Their expensive nature as well as fewer drug options remain a hindrance while opting for specialty medications. According to Cigna, the average annual price of specialty drug therapy is 75 times more than the cost incurred to obtain therapy for non-specialty prescription drugs. As a result, specialty medications make up for over 50% of total drug spending across the United States.Thereby, the decision to upgrade its suite of pharmacy products and services and popularize the varied benefits of biosimilars within the market seems to be a well-timed move on CI’s part.Enhanced pharmacy offerings are expected to lure more customers in buying prescription medications from Cigna’s pharmacy network. This, in turn, is likely to boost its pharmacy revenues that contribute massively to the overall top line of CI. Pharmacy revenues accounted for 70.8% of CI’s top line in the first nine months of 2022. This year, management projects adjusted revenues to be at a minimum of $179 billion, implying minimum growth of 2.8% from the 2021 figure.Cigna boasts an expansive pharmacy network spread across the United States. At the end of 2021, the network comprised 13 order-processing home delivery and specialty pharmacies, six patient contact centers, 30 specialty dispensing and four high-volume automated dispensing pharmacies. The acquisition of Express Scripts back in 2018 provided a great impetus to CI’s pharmacy business.Story continuesShares of Cigna have gained 57.4% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 16.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCigna currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are IRadimed Corporation IRMD, Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

190,f3a026a4-724e-38ac-be8a-a41030a2b84b,SWKS,2022-12-07,7 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-screaming-buys-2023-001617334.html,1670112977,STORY,"['KLIC', 'CRUS', 'SWKS', 'META', 'REX', 'VIPS']","[While no one enjoys enduring significant market volatility, the downside invariably brings stocks that are screaming buys to the table. These are companies that have either absorbed way too much red ink than they deserve or are woefully underappreciated. Regardless, astute investors should plan ahead with compelling tickers to add for 2023.For this list of screaming buys, I’m primarily focusing on companies featuring resilient financials. Although this year’s bearish forces discounted most stocks, their financials generally reflect the damage. With these ideas, the underlying organizations weathered the storm without incurring devastating blows. Thus, they’re more primed for eventual upside.To be fair, anytime you’re dealing with discounted market opportunities, certain risks abound. Nevertheless, if you’re feeling brave, these are the screaming buys to put on your radar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSWKSSkyworks Solutions$93.96REXREX. American Resources$34.42KLICKulicke &amp; Soffa$47.78METAMeta Platforms$123.49VIPSVipshop$11.96CRUSCirrus Logic$74.09CCRDCoreCard$29.19Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksA semiconductor firm headquartered in Irvine, California, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) manufactures semiconductors for use in radio frequency and mobile communications systems. Essentially, the company’s products undergird the industries of tomorrow, such as 5G (and all that this entails) and the Internet of Things.Despite significant relevancies, the market doesn’t really appreciate SWKS. On a year-to-date basis, shares plunged almost 41% of equity value. However, we could be witnessing the early innings of a market recovery. In the trailing month, shares gained nearly 14%. With this performance, it brings down the six-month trailing performance to a loss of only 14.3%.Moving forward, investors should note Skyworks’ profit margins. Regarding gross margin, it stands at over 47%, beating out nearly 77% of its competitors. Not only that, this magnitude implies greater flexibility toward economies of scale. Adding to this assessment are strong operating and net margins, potentially enabling Skyworks with superior pricing power. Therefore, SWKS represents one of the screaming buys to consider.Story continuesREX American Resources (REX)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA lesser-known entity, REX American Resources (NYSE:REX) is an American producer and retailer of ethanol, distillers grains and natural gas as well as a holding company in energy entities. It’s one of the screaming buys for investors with a long time horizon. Because of geopolitical flashpoints leading to an international energy crisis, investors should focus on alternative infrastructures.To be fair, prospective buyers must exercise patience with REX stock. Throughout this year, shares pinged all over the map. For all its chart mobility, REX gained only 3% YTD. Still, that’s a much better performance than the benchmark equities index. As well, near-term momentum entices. In the trailing month, shares gained a very healthy 20% of equity value.Financially, REX offers plenty to like. Notably, the company features a strong balance sheet, highlighted by a cash-to-debt ratio of 19 times. Also, it commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.7%, which is outstanding for the sector. To top it off, the market prices REX at less than 12-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings, making it significantly undervalued.Kulicke &amp; Soffa (KLIC)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs a Singapore-based enterprise, Kulicke &amp; Soffa (NASDAQ:KLIC) doesn’t get much attention from investors stateside. However, in my opinion, this dynamic needs to change as KLIC easily represents one of the screaming buys. It’s one of the reasons why whenever an opportunity to talk about this company comes up, I take it.Per its website, Kulicke &amp; Soffa represents a leading provider of semiconductor, LED and electronic assembly solutions. Its products serve the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing and industrial markets. Despite these enormous relevancies, KLIC finds itself down nearly 27% for the year. However, investors are steadily warming to the opportunity. In the trailing month, KLIC gained an impressive 17.6%.For me, though, the reason I harp on the company centers on its grossly undervalued nature. On the balance sheet, KLIC features a cash-to-debt ratio of 18.6%, beating out over 75% of the competition. Its three-year revenue growth rate is bonkers at 44.2%. Moreover, its gross margin of nearly 50% combined with excellent net margins affords the company excellent pricing power. And then, the market only prices KLIC at less than 7-times TTM earnings. Ridiculous!Meta Platforms (META)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For those that want to trash Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), I appreciate the sentiment. With the company melting down on Wall Street, META doesn’t seem like one of the screaming buys. Instead, it seems like a screaming sell. Unfortunately, management’s pivot toward the metaverse – or the next generation of internet connectivity – has not panned out.In fact, the company attracted both analyst downgrades and activist investor criticisms. Fundamentally, the company may need to scale back on pet projects and focus on what actually works. Unfortunately for those in operations, the requested changes involve aggressive cost cutting and headcount reductions. Naturally, the leadership team doesn’t take too kindly to the suggestions.Still, my speculation is that management will recognize certain harsh realities. By focusing on its massive Facebook social media network and other relevant enterprises, Meta could eventually right itself. Despite all the hits the company absorbed, it maintains a stable balance sheet, decent long-term sales trends and excellent profit margins. Plus, it’s undervalued to boot, making META one of the screaming buys to consider.Vipshop (VIPS)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comBased in China, Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) specializes in online discount sales via its e-commerce website VIP.com. While it’s a popular site, it slots in below powerhouses like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Politically, flying under the radar may be an advantage for Vipshop. In recent years, Beijing cracked down on tech firms suspected of antitrust activities. Further, the third term of President Xi Jinping consolidates maximum power under one administration.Now, the world’s second-largest economy suffers under the draconian zero-Covid policy along with sharp subsequent protests. Cynically, companies like Vipshop may benefit under the enforcement of such severe mitigation protocols due to contactless services. Further, the enterprise’s focus on providing discounts may appeal to Chinese consumers who have been hurting because of pandemic-related headwinds.Financially, VIPS brings a strong balance sheet to the table. For instance, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at nearly 8 times, beating out 86% of its rivals. Also, the market prices VIPS stock at only 7.2-times forward earnings, representing a significantly undervalued investment. Therefore, it’s one of the few screaming buys from China.Cirrus Logic (CRUS)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Austin, Texas, Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) is an American fabless semiconductor supplier that specializes in analog, mixed-signal and audio DSP integrated circuits. Fundamentally, Cirrus should benefit from two long-term catalysts. First, CRUS may rise on the necessity of domestic supply chain resilience. Second, the Chips and Science Act should rejuvenate the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.Still, throughout this year, investors have been slow in recognizing the potential upside opportunity of CRUS stock. Since the January opener, shares dropped 20% of equity value. However, it is starting to gain some positive momentum. For example, in the trailing month, CRUS popped up 6%. For those seeking a great deal, you don’t want to ignore this chip supplier.Overall, Cirrus delivers an outstanding financial profile. Undergirding the enterprise is a stable balance sheet, highlighted by an Altman Z-Score of 6.81, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk. Also, the company enjoys solid long-term revenue growth and profit margins.To top it off, the market prices CRUS at 13.6-times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 18.2 times. Therefore, it’s one of the screaming buys but you better act fast.CoreCard (CCRD)Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a ""BUY NOW!"" button on a laptop keyboard.Source: ShutterstockBased in Norcross, Georgia, CoreCard (NYSE:CCRD) delivers a powerful and integrated solution for any type of card issuing program including complex credit, according to its website. Unfortunately, headwinds negatively impacting consumer sentiment pressured the broader credit industry. Still, as circumstances normalize (or if people become fully acclimated to the new normal), CoreCard may become a beneficiary.Generally speaking, the market didn’t see it that way for most of this year. Since the January opener, CCRD dropped 24% of equity value. However, CCRD is on a comeback trail. In the trailing month, shares gained a very impressive 24%. Depending on the news cycle, CCRD may be able to sneak in some more positive returns.No matter what, though, CoreCard might appeal to the patient contrarian. According to Gurufocus.com, the underlying business features five green flags and no red flags. That’s actually a rarity for the investment resource. Among the attributes it identified are strong financial strength and low bankruptcy risk (via an Altman Z-Score of nearly 17). Thus, CCRD makes for a quiet name among the screaming buys.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.44% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.11%.Heading into today, shares of the athletic apparel maker had gained 17.32% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 9.06% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.22% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nike as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be December 20, 2022. On that day, Nike is projected to report earnings of $0.66 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 20.48%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.58 billion, up 10.76% from the year-ago period.NKE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.97 per share and revenue of $48.97 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -20.8% and +4.84%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Nike is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Looking at its valuation, Nike is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 36.9. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.58.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 3.63. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Shoes and Retail Apparel industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.63 as of yesterday's close.The Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 232, putting it in the bottom 8% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, PF-06928316 or RSVpreF, as submitted for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age and older.Priority Review designation by the FDA reduces the standard BLA review period by four months. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA on the RSVpreF application is in May 2023. This decision follows the FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation of RSVpreF in older adults in March 2022.""With no RSV vaccines currently available, older adults remain at-risk for RSV disease and potential severe outcomes, including serious respiratory symptoms, hospitalization, and in some cases, even death,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research &amp; Development, Pfizer. ""The FDA’s acceptance of the BLA for our RSV vaccine candidate is an important regulatory milestone in Pfizer’s efforts to help protect older adults against RSV and demonstrates additional progress toward what has been an elusive public health goal – reducing the overall burden associated with this infectious disease.""The regulatory submission is supported by results of the Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05035212) RENOIR (RSV vaccine Efficacy study iN Older adults Immunized against RSV disease). RENOIR is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a single dose of RSVpreF in adults 60 years of age and older. RENOIR has enrolled approximately 37,000 participants, randomized to receive RSVpreF 120 μg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. In August 2022, Pfizer announced positive top-line results of an interim efficacy analysis for RENOIR.Story continuesBurden of RSVRSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness.1 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual and can potentially cause severe illness in young infants, older adults, and individuals with certain chronic medical conditions. 2,3,4 In the United States alone, among older adults, RSV infections account for approximately 60,000–120,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–14,000 deaths each year.5,6,7,8 Among children younger than five years old in the U.S., RSV infections account for approximately 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000–80,000 hospitalizations occur each year.9,10,11 RSV incidence can vary dramatically from one year to the next, and this year there has been a large resurgence in cases following an evolution of masking and isolation measures.RSV is a disease for which there are currently no prophylactic, therapeutic, or vaccine options for older adults and the medical community is limited to offering only supportive care for adults with the illness.About RSVpreFPfizer’s investigational RSV vaccine candidate builds on foundational basic science discoveries including those made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which detailed the crystal structure of prefusion F, a key form of the viral fusion protein (F) that RSV uses to enter human cells. The NIH research showed that antibodies specific to the prefusion form were highly effective at blocking virus infection, suggesting a prefusion F-based vaccine may confer optimal protection against RSV. After this important discovery, Pfizer tested numerous versions of a stabilized prefusion F protein and identified a candidate that elicited a strong anti-viral immune response in pre-clinical evaluations. The bivalent vaccine candidate is composed of equal amounts of recombinant RSV prefusion F from subgroups A and B.Pfizer is currently the only company with an investigational vaccine being prepared for regulatory applications for both infants through maternal immunization and older adults to help protect against RSV. In November 2022, Pfizer announced a positive interim analysis of its Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04424316) MATISSE (MATernal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy) investigating its bivalent RSV prefusion vaccine candidate, RSVpreF or PF-06928316, when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Originally marketed by a forerunner of GSK, it was later sold successively to Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim and finally Sanofi.Numerous generic drugmakers also launched versions of the medicine, but none are defendants in the cases in federal court.In 2019, some manufacturers and pharmacies halted sales of the drug over concerns that its active ingredient, ranitidine, degraded over time to form a chemical called NDMA. While NDMA is found in low levels in food and water, it is known to cause cancer in larger amounts.Story continuesThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2020 pulled all remaining brand name Zantac and generic versions off the market, citing research showing the amount of NDMA in the products increases the longer the drug is stored and could potentially become unsafe.Lawsuits began piling up soon after the recalls began from people who said they developed cancer after taking Zantac. Plaintiffs said the companies knew, or should have known, that ranitidine posed a cancer risk and that they failed to warn consumers.The litigation initially included claims of over 10 types of cancer allegedly linked to the medicine, but were later narrowed to five - bladder, esophageal, gastrointestinal, liver and pancreatic. Some claims involving other cancers remain in state courts.All of the cases filed in federal courts nationwide were consolidated before Rosenberg in Florida.In Tuesday's order, she found that expert witnesses the plaintiffs planned to use to establish that Zantac can cause cancer could not be admitted in court because they ""systemically utilized unreliable methodologies"" and showed ""a lack of internally consistent, objective, science-based standards for the evenhanded evaluation of data.""State court judges will also have to rule on whether to allow plaintiffs' experts on Zantac's alleged cancer risks before state cases can go to trial.The legal standards for evaluating experts in many states are similar to the federal standard used by Rosenberg, but state judges could rule differently.The first state trial is currently scheduled to begin in February in California.

If you want to read about some more best German stocks, go directly to the 5 Best German Stocks to Buy Now.Germany is the largest economy by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Europe, even though several financial markets of the country are actually smaller than those of neighboring France and the UK. Germany has the eighth-highest share of the global equity markets, a somewhat interesting number given the strength and power it enjoys on the world stage. It has been observed that retail investors in the country are often more hesitant to invest in stocks than in countries like the United Kingdom or United States. This is partly due to the fact that Germany has a more generous government pension system than the rest of the world, but another reason for this lies in the nature of the German economy. The contribution of manufacturing to total GDP is proportionally larger in Germany than other countries, lowering the centrality of the stock market for generating revenue. The largest stock market in Germany is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, an international trading center, one of the largest for securities in the world. In total, the country has seven stock exchanges with a share in turnover of around 90 per cent. In this capacity, it ensures the functioning of exchange trading. Of the approximately 200 market participants, roughly half are from countries other than Germany. The total market capitalization of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange amounts to around two trillion euros. The traditional trading floor of the Börse Frankfurt, and the Xetra electronic trading system, are two main parts of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.Even though the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is not the largest in Europe, it is considered one of the most important financial hubs in the region due to the economic integration created by the euro. According to the World Bank, a collection of development indicators show that the stock market returns in Germany were around 23.68 % in 2021. As per a report by the global body, the Germany Stock Market Index (DE40) is expected to trade at 13,972.81 points by the end of this quarter. Story continuesHowever, the German markets have also come under pressure from economic uncertainty. The import-export numbers, closely tied to the stock market, are especially telling. Recent data shows the German October import price index rose by 23.5% year-on-year, falling back from the 29.8% year-on-year gain in September, registering the slowest pace of increase in a year.  The German market is also staring at the biggest decline it has seen in nine months as October exports fell 0.6% month-month, weaker than expectations of a 0.2% fall month-on-month. Imports fell 3.7% month-month as well, weaker than expectations of a 0.5% month-on-month decline. For investors who are tired of boring, albeit rewarding investments in giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), it might be prudent to invest in the German economy. Some top German firms are trading on exchanges in the United States.

If you want to see more best AI stocks, go directly to 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.AI, which stands for artificial intelligence, is already helping companies make better decisions. For retailers, AI is helping price items so companies sell more items. For internet companies, artificial intelligence is helping companies sell more ads more efficiently. For banks, the technology is helping financial institutions make better loans.For the future, AI will likely make possible many new technologies that could benefit society. For the car industry, AI could make possible autonomous driving that could lower costs. For the education industry, it could offer even better personalized learning that could make education more efficient. For the pharmaceutical industry, AI could help create new medicines that improve the lives of billions.Given how transformative AI could be, PwC estimates worldwide GDP will be 14% higher by the end of the decade thanks to AI as the technology increases productivity gains.For the decades beyond 2030, it is likely AI's contribution will be even greater. In the future, AI progress could accelerate if quantum computing ever becomes feasible. With quantum computing, computers can do certain tasks far faster than any traditional computer can and the faster computing could help AI be even more productive.Given the vast potential of AI, many of the world's leading tech companies are working on making the technology better.Some companies like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) are working on building quantum computers while others like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are working on building more efficient semiconductors that power machine learning algorithms. Yet others like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are working on building autonomous driving vehicles.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone. As a result, demand for many companies has declined and the broader market has declined.Story continuesYear to date, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.6% and the Nasdaq has declined 29% year to date. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Advanced AI Companies, we picked 10 leading tech companies that did AI research.Given which company is more advanced than another is subjective, we decided to use market capitalization as a way to rank the best AI stocks since a company having a larger market capitalization can generally mean it has more potential resources to perform AI research.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.For those of you interested, also check out 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.10 Most Advanced AI Companies10.

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is also known for working on quantum computers which could one day help make AI even more productive. According to the company, the ""nascent technology is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s most powerful classical supercomputers cannot solve and never will."" Out of the 920 hedge funds in our database at the end of the third quarter, 40 were long shares of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a leading tech company that does a lot of AI research that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Market Capitalization as of 12/5: $133.93 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 117In terms of artificial intelligence, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an enterprise cloud company that offers its customers AI that helps them better predict business outcomes, augments business processes, and better handle customer service. Partly as a result of its AI software, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) sales and earnings have increased substantially over the years.For the future, it's likely that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) will continue to improve its AI offerings given that the company spent $4.47 billion in total research and development expense in fiscal year 2022, up from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. 117 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) at the end of Q3. The company ranks #9 on our list of best AI stocks given its market capitalization of $133.93 billion as of 12/5.8.

The models can be custom-trained for more accurate business results."" Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) also uses AI to make its existing enterprise software even more useful. Given its market capitalization of $214.16 billion, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) ranks #8 on our list of best AI stocks.7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Market Capitalization as of 12/5: $324.63 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 177Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has invested a lot into artificial intelligence given the company is competing with TikTok in short videos. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also used AI to serve up more useful ads to its users and to create AI chatbots that could one day be useful for businesses. In the third quarter of 2022, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) spent $9.17 billion on research and development, up from $6.32 billion in the same quarter of 2021. 177 hedge funds owned shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at the end of Q3.6. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Market Capitalization as of 12/5: $408.61 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading semicoductor company that could benefit from the growth of AI in the future given its GPUs can speed up computational processes for machine learning. Baron Funds described NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI potential in a Q3 2022 investor letter,NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.As of December 5, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $408.61 billion, ranking #5 on our list of best AI stocks.Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

Clients from the major Swedish city will be leveraging solutions in digital manufacturing, connected products, and online customer experiences combined with technologies like cloud, Internet of Things, software engineering and artificial intelligence from Infosys.The center will allow Infosys to not only expand its opportunities in the local industries of Gothenburg but also increase its reach to the Swedish market and clients. Thus, this investment will enhance Infosys’ localization strategy in the Nordic region.Infosys has been reinforcing its digital-transformation capabilities to expand and solidify its position in the highly competitive environment. It enables its clients across more than 45 countries to create and execute strategies for their digital transformation. Such efforts in the digital-transformation business will aid the company in competing with peers like Accenture and Cognizant.Infosys Limited Price and ConsensusInfosys Limited Price and ConsensusInfosys Limited price-consensus-chart | Infosys Limited QuoteIn November, INFY’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Infosys BPM, unveiled the Center of AI and Automation at the company’s Business Experience Lounge in Poland, in collaboration with International Business Machines IBM, to enhance the digital capabilities of global enterprise clients in the AI and hybrid cloud spaces.The center enables both Infosys and IBM clients to analyze workflows, design AI-infused apps with low-code tooling, assign tasks to bots, and track performance on the go. Infosys BPM’s Center of AI and Automation, which emphasizes a two-year agreement with IBM, is launched to commemorate the subsidiary firm’s 15th anniversary.Story continuesIn September, Infosys collaborated with Bpost (Belgium Post), a postal operator and e-commerce logistics provider headquartered in Brussels, to provide cloud security solutions that will identify and ensure rapid response to suspicious security events.In the same month, Infosys collaborated with Spirit AeroSystems, Inc., one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aerostructures for commercial airplanes, defense platforms, and business/regional jets. Per the five-year contract, the IT company intends to offer end-to-end aerostructure and systems engineering services for product development of commercial, business jet and emerging aircraft programs.Back-to-back contract wins are driving Infosys’ top-line performance. In the last reported financial results for second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s revenues jumped 13.9% year over year to $4.56 billion.Infosys’ near-term growth prospects are likely to be hurt as organizations are postponing their plans of investing in big and expensive technology products on growing global slowdown concerns amid the persistent macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical tensions. Moreover, elevated operating expenses related to hiring new employees and sales and marketing strategies to capture more market share are likely to strain margins in the near term.These, along with the rapid proliferation of customizable Internet-based software, have been hampering Infosys’ traditional outsourcing business.

(MPC) has set a refining industry record with six of its refineries, along with its San Antonio office building, receiving 2022 ENERGY STAR® efficiency certifications from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) has set an industry record with the most refineries ever honored for energy efficiency by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in one year.Six MPC refineries recently earned EPA ENERGY STAR certifications, putting their performance in the top 25% of all similar facilities across the U.S.Since refineries first became eligible for this recognition in 2006, MPC has received more ENERGY STAR certifications than all other refining companies combined.The certifications for these refineries mean their energy efficiency is superior to at least 75% of similar petroleum refineries across the U.S. The EPA confirms efficiency levels among similar refineries nationwide by referring to the Solomon Associates Energy Intensity Index™ (EII) metric. Refineries must have an EII level that ranks among the top 25% of their industry peers to qualify for ENERGY STAR certification. The MPC refineries certified this year have all previously earned this recognition:Anacortes, Washington - third consecutive certification, third overallCanton, Ohio - 17th consecutive certification (every year eligible)Detroit, Michigan - first certification since 2012, seventh overallGaryville, Louisiana - 17th consecutive certification (every year eligible)Robinson, Illinois - fifth consecutive certification, eighth overallSt. Paul Park, Minnesota - fourth consecutive certification, fifth overallA primary factor behind MPC's energy efficiency for more than a decade has been its Focus on Energy program, which establishes key performance indicators to guide energy management across sites. This program has helped avoid the equivalent of nearly 2 billion Btu per hour of energy use and over $65 million per year in costs. It's roughly the same amount of energy used by over 100,000 homes or 200,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles in a year.Story continuesIndoor efficiencyThe ENERGY STAR certification for MPC's San Antonio office building is the second consecutive certification for the 659,000-square-foot structure and its sixth overall. To become certified, commercial buildings must achieve an ENERGY STAR score of 75 or higher based on their energy use as calculated with the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® tool. The score accounts for differences in operating conditions, regional weather data and other considerations.The EPA initiated the ENERGY STAR program in 1992 as a voluntary, market-based partnership to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency. The first ENERGY STAR label awards for commercial office buildings came in 1999. Refineries became eligible for this honor in 2006. Since then, MPC has received more ENERGY STAR certifications than all other refining companies combined.Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Tuesday, December 6, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/Sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730556/Marathon-Petroleum-Earns-Record-Level-of-EPA-Recognition-for-Energy-Efficiency]"

The leading upstream energy firm is likely to see earnings growth of 64% this year.Factors Working in FavorThe price of West Texas Intermediate crude, trading at more than the $75 per barrel mark again, is still favorable for upstream operations. EOG Resources, a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is thus well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG will be able to reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRisksAlthough EOG Resources is committed to returning capital to shareholders, it has consistently been paying lower dividend yields than the composite stocks belonging to the energy sector over the past five years.Rising lease and well-operating costs are hurting the company’s bottom line.Last WordOverall, the business scenario will possibly remain favorable for EOG Resources. With the transition to premium drilling and footprint in prolific basins, the company has more room to gain.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked players in the same space include Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, PBF Energy Inc.

Less-than-expected inflation rates in October with respect to several measures along with a dovish comment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in November boosted investors’ confidence in risky assets like equities.However, hotter-than-expected job additions and a higher wage rate in November once again dampened the mood on Wall Street. Market participants are now unsure whether the Fed will reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike in the December FOMC meeting, as indicated by Powell, or will hike the rate by 75 basis points for the fifth time in a row.A tight labor market is being perceived as a pushback from the Fed’s recent stance of trying to reassure the markets that it would slacken its stringent policy measures to avoid a hard-landing of the economy.Market participants are not sure whether the terminal interest for this round of monetary tightening will stay within the 5% threshold or go beyond that. A section of economists and financial experts are concerned that a higher interest rate will lead to a recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors will try to safeguard their portfolio.

And increasing the odds of success by making sure the sustainability of a trend isn't easy.Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.Investors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.There are several stocks that passed through the screen and AES (AES) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for ""trend"" investing.A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. AES is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 2.8% over this period.However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 5.9% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this power company.Moreover, AES is currently trading at 88.7% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.So, the price trend in AES may not reverse anytime soon.In addition to AES, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard. In addition to allowing you to backtest the effectiveness of your strategy, the program comes loaded with some of our most successful stock-picking strategies.Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Results of the election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board are expected on Friday.The vote is a crucial test of the UAW's ability to organize workers in the growing electric vehicle supply chain.The UAW petition sought the election after a majority of employees signed cards authorizing the union to represent them.UAW President Ray Curry said in October that ""by refusing to recognize their majority will"" Ultium ""has decided to ignore democracy and delay the recognition process.""An Ultium spokesperson said the venture ""respects workers’ right to choose union representation and the efforts of the UAW to organize battery cell manufacturing workers at our Ohio manufacturing site.""Last week, GM CEO Mary Barra told Bloomberg TV the company is ""very supportive of the plant being unionized ... The employees are going to be voting, but we’re very supportive.""In a trip to South Korea in May, President Joe Biden expressed support for workers seeking to unionize JV battery plants. The Detroit Three automakers all have battery plants in the works with South Korean partners.In August, the Ohio plant began production, the first of at least four planned Ultium U.S. battery factories.GM and LG Energy are considering an Indiana site for a fourth U.S. battery plant. They are building a $2.6 billion plant in Michigan, set to open in 2024. Last week, Ultium said it would boost its planned investment in a $2.3 billion Tennessee plant by another $275 million.In July, the U.S. Energy Department said it intends to loan Ultium $2.5 billion to help finance new manufacturing facilities including the Ohio plant. Sources told Reuters the loan could be finalized as soon as next week. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

The financial help from the governments of Canada and Ontario has enabled GM to completely retool the CAMI Assembly plant in record time to become the new global manufacturing home of BrightDrop’s fully electric delivery vans. GM began transforming CAMI for EV production on May 1, 2022. BrightDrop also announced the initiation of commercial operations in Canada, with DHL as its first customer in the country.The company began production of the BrightDrop Zevo 600 electric delivery vans at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario on Dec 5, signaling a new chapter in Canada’s EV production and a significant step in the fight against climate change.The business was launched in 2021 with nearly $800 million investment from its parent company GM to convert the CAMI Assembly plant to BrightDrop’s high-volume EV production facility. To cater to strong customer demand, CAMI expects to produce 50,000 Zevo vans annually by 2025. Scaled production is scheduled to begin with Zevo 600 models in January 2023 and Zevo 400 models in late 2023.DHL Express Canada intends to add its first BrightDrop Zevo electric delivery vans to its fleet early next year. Bringing BrightDrop’s commercial solutions to its operations is part of DHL’s €7 billion aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.Following one of the best launches, BrightDrop completed the delivery of the first Zevo 600s to FedEx last year.The BrightDrop Zevo is a great example of GM's Ultium EV architecture, and it is laudable that within less than two years, it has gone from concept to commercialization.Riding on the company’s huge demand in the United States, with more than 30 customers, BrightDrop has made its move into Canada’s market to promote sustainable transportation.With full-scale manufacturing of the BrightDrop Zevo electric delivery vans, BrightDrop’s customers will replace their gasoline and diesel vans leading to a significant reduction in its fleet of greenhouse-gas tailpipe emissions. At the same time, BrightDrop customer productivity will increase with the use of its suite of products like Trace eCarts, which were developed and tested majorly by the GM Canadian Technical Centre in Oshawa.In another development, General Motors and LG Energy Solution will invest an additional $275 million in their joint venture battery plant in Tennessee to ramp up production by more than 40%.The new investment in the joint venture known as Ultium Cells LLC is an addition to the $2.3 billion announced in April 2021 to build the sprawling facility. Production at the plant is scheduled to commence in late 2023.The Inflation Reduction Act in the United States has spurred automakers worldwide to move operations to the United States.  The act, which was signed into law in August, intends to enhance EV capabilities by providing manufacturers with $40 billion in tax credits and stating that EVs eligible for such credits should be made with more American-made parts. Undoubtedly, this law has led automakers to scramble for U.S. production of electric vehicles and batteries to qualify for the incentives.    It is, therefore, natural that domestic production of battery cells in North America is gradually becoming vital for automakers to intensify their EV footprints to qualify for federal incentives.The Ultium Cells Spring Hill site, part of Ultium Cells, LLC, is expected to collaborate with other joint venture battery cell manufacturing sites in Ohio and Michigan. A plant in Michigan is also underway and is scheduled to begin production in late 2024.The expansion of the battery cell output at Ultium Cells Spring Hill will ensure that GM offers one of the most robust EV portfolios and solidify its path toward U.S. EV leadership.Shares of GM have lost 37% over a year compared with the industry’s 50.1% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some better-ranked players in the auto space – CarParts.com PRTS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN and Genuine Parts Company GPC, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intuitive Surgical's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's moderate 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 17% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Given that Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Intuitive Surgical's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Union Pacific UNP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern NSC.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Biden Intervention Averts Rail StrikeOn Dec 2, President Joe Biden signed the resolution to avoid a rail strike, thereby bringing relief to the U.S. economy, which is already reeling under high inflation and supply chain issues. Unions and railroad companies like Union Pacific, CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern had time till Dec 9 to iron out differences and reach an agreement to avoid a strike. With the President signing the bill that would make a rail strike illegal, that damaging possibility has been put to rest.All the abovementioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that stocks in the railroad space have been hitherto hit hard by headwinds like supply-chain woes, labor woes and high fuel costs. Due to supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity, overall volumes declined 2% year over year at Norfolk Southern in third-quarter 2022.While releasing the third-quarter 2022 results, management at Union Pacific trimmed its carload growth (volumes) outlook for the current year to around 3% from the 4-5% band expected earlier. The high inflation-induced rise in interest rates, which may lead to an economic slowdown, resulted in the outlook cut. Also, now UNP expects 2022 operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) to be around 60%. Earlier the expectation was for the ratio to be around 58%. Lower the ratio, the better. The unfavorable forecast can be attributed to economic uncertainty. Supply-chain woes and escalated expenses on fuel also resulted in the deterioration of the operating ratio at another railroad operator — CSX Corporation — in the September quarter.Story continuesIf thestrike had materialized, the supply-chain woes would have been further aggravated, in turn, dealing a huge blow to customers already suffering from sky-high inflation. A nationwide railroad strike would have hit the economy very hard. The work stoppage by railroad workers was estimated to have cost the already fragile economy more than $2 billion a day.No wonder, the President was a relieved man, before signing the bill he said, “The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what, without a doubt, would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar.”With the damaging strike being averted let’s have a look back and recapture the related events.A strike by U.S. railroad workers had been looming large ever since workers at the largest rail union in the United States voted against a provisional deal reached in September this year. The rejection was due to the absence of a clause pertaining to granting of paid sick leave to workers in the railroad industry. The deal, however, included 24% compounded wage hike over the 2020-2024 period and five annual lump sum payments amounting to $1,000, per a Reuters report.With the specter of a rail strike looming, that would cripple the economy, the President intervened to thwart that damaging possibility. Accordingly, the House voted 290 to 137 on Nov 30 for imposing the tentative deal reached in September. The same was passed by the Senate (80-15) a day later. Following approval by the House and the Senate, the President signed the legislation to block the rail strike. However, the Senate failed to approve a measure pertaining to paid sick leave.What’s Ahead?While it is clear that there will be no rail strike, the fact remains that the major area of dispute – regarding paid sick leaves, is still unresolved. However, on the contentious issue, the President has said ""That fight isn't over."" While unions demand the presence of paid sick leave, railroad companies like UNP, CSX and NSC are totally opposed to the inclusion of the clause as it would increase their labor costs, Given this backdrop. we expect investors to follow the updates on this burning issue in the coming days.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

We have Royal Caribbean, Paramount, and pot stocks. Allie Canal is also joining us here today. So let's start with my pick, and that's Royal Caribbean. JP Morgan cutting its rating on the stock to underweight. They slashed that from overweight. Also reduced their price target to 47 bucks a share on funding a concern. So $10 lower than where it's trading this afternoon.The firm saying that Royal Caribbean could face a $400 million funding shortfall by the end of next year. This comes despite the $10 billion of capital raises so far this year. Comparing Royal Caribbean to its competitors, JP Morgan likes Norwegian, writing in a note that, quote, ""it has the most forward pricing momentum of the three publicly traded players.""Allie, when we take a look at the cruise lines, clearly a very, very tough 2 and 1/2 years for many of those names. Royal Caribbean, over the last six months, barely in positive territory. So outperforming the broader market, but year to date, we're selling at losses about 25%. And if you take JP Morgan's note into account, it looks like there could be some troubling time here ahead.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, a lot of this has to do with that unfavorable macroeconomic environment, how that could negatively impact the sector. JP Morgan also noted that Norwegian has a smaller, younger, and more nimble fleet with that premium pricing power, as you mentioned. And I think a key story here is the ability for Norwegian to grow.And at a time when we're seeing a lot of pent-up travel demand, if you take that and you couple that with the inflationary environment, maybe consumers want that value package that cruise ships provide. That's a good thing for the sector overall, but it seems like they favor some of those other names other than Royal Caribbean. And that's automatically going to negatively impact the stock.]"

227,f866a5af-bc42-394a-aa01-60c5539b8d02,MAR,2022-12-07,RPT-COLUMN-Tin must tame its wildness to meet coming demand surge: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-column-tin-must-tame-010000975.html,1670374800,STORY,['HG=F'],"[(Repeats Dec. 6 column without change)By Andy HomeLONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The world is going to need another 50,000 tonnes of tin per year by 2030 to meet a looming surge in demand, according to the International Tin Association (ITA).Tin is an often overlooked critical mineral, commonly associated with the humble tin can, even though packaging today accounts for only 12% of global usage. Almost half the tin consumed every year is now used as a solder in circuit boards.The faster the world moves towards the internet-of-things, the more tin will be needed to glue the expanding metaverse together.Tin will also benefit from the green energy transition thanks to its use in solar panels and batteries, both lead-acid and lithium-ion.The additional production required to feed the coming demand boom is a big ask of a sector that currently produces around 380,000 tonnes per year of primary refined metal.A recent history of extreme price volatility and growing resource nationalism in Indonesia, the world's largest tin exporter, add to the challenge.ROLLERCOASTER RIDE SLOWS...FOR NOWThe ITA estimates the tin production sector needs around $1.4 billion of investment to deliver 50,000 tonnes per year more tin by the end of the decade.It's a relatively modest amount, equivalent to around one medium-sized copper mine, but investors have in the past been wary of a market prone to extreme swings in price.This year has been a particularly wild ride, London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month tin imploding from a record high of $51,000 per tonne in March to a two-year low of $17,350 in November before bouncing to a current $24,430.Tin's spin from boom to bust is in part down to COVID-19.Key producers in Asia and South America were hit hard by lockdowns and quarantines, output at the world's top 10 operators sliding by 13% over 2020 and 2021. Demand simultaneously exploded as locked-down populations splurged on consumer electronics to pass the time.Story continuesBoth drivers have gone into reverse this year, producers lifting output just as demand for consumer goods abates.Tin users expect demand to contract by around 0.6% in 2022 after stellar growth of 7.6% last year, according to the ITA's annual survey.The shift in fundamentals, however, has been sharply accentuated by speculative flows on both London and Shanghai markets.Investment fund positioning on the LME swivelled from record long in March to record short in October, equivalent to some 20,000 tonnes of net selling, which is a lot in what is one of the exchange's less liquid contracts.Too much rather than too little liquidity is the problem in Shanghai, where volumes and market open interest surged as the price collapsed, suggesting a mass bear attack.The subsequent recovery rally has generated a lot of churn on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) tin contract with volumes hitting a record monthly high of 3.98 million lots in November. But market open interest also remains elevated at 98,474 contracts, implying the bears are largely holding their ground.Tin moved onto the investment radar in China last year with a step-change in activity on the ShFE contract. Heightened speculative activity in what remains a small physical market comes with the potential for more price turbulence.INDONESIAN UNCERTAINTYIndonesia's talk of banning exports of tin ingot injects significant fundamental uncertainty into the speculative mix.The country exported 75,000 tonnes of refined tin last year with shipments running 8% higher through the first 10 months of this year. It is the world's biggest supplier outside China.The government wants to replicate its success in the nickel sector, where a ban on exports of unprocessed ore generated a build-out of value-add processing capacity.The key difference with tin, however, is that the Indonesian authorities spent much of the last decade tightening export rules such that what leaves the country is already in high-purity refined form.A move further downstream requires more advanced technology to produce solder or tin chemicals.State producer PT Timah needs around two years to develop its existing tin chemical facility and longer to secure markets, Alwin Albar, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Tin Exporters, told a parliamentary hearing.No date for any ban or restrictions has yet been set as the government studies potential time-lines.But the threat of disruption is already impacting market dynamics with Chinese buyers trying to get ahead of any change in export rules.China imported 22,600 tonnes of refined tin in the first 10 months of the year with Indonesian metal accounting for 19,000 tonnes. That's more than China imported from Indonesia over 2020 and 2021 combined.Higher imports have helped Shanghai stocks rebuild to 4,708 tonnes from a meagre 1,260 at the start of 2022.But it's noticeable that LME inventory has started sliding again as Indonesian metal gets diverted to China. After peaking at 5,160 tonnes in September, headline LME tin stocks have fallen to 3,075 tonnes with 535 tonnes awaiting physical load-out.DESPERATELY SEEKING STABILITYNew tin projects aren't viable at a price of $18,000 per tonne. Nor is a significant amount of the artisanal mining that plays a big part in the global supply picture.But they don't need a price of $50,000 either. An ideal scenario for new projects would be a stable $25,000-30,000 range, Thomas Bünger, Chief Executive of First Tin, told the ITA's Investing in Tin seminar.Most tin producers would probably agree and the market could really do with a breather after the price swings of the last two years.Unfortunately, the combination of high speculative activity on the Shanghai market and possible disruption to Indonesian exports suggests the current calm may not last long.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters(Editing by David Evans)]"

Given that the Fed signaled that their terminal interest rate will largely track inflation, markets grew more cautious ahead of the reading.Spot gold traded around $1,770.33 an ounce, while gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,782.35 an ounce. Both instruments are trading down for the week, as stronger-than-expected U.S. data pushed up fears of inflation remaining sticky in the country.The dollar recovered sharply from a five-month low this week, and weighed on most commodities that are priced in the greenback.The Fed is set to meet next week in its final meeting for the year. While the bank is expected to hike interest rates by a relatively smaller margin, it has warned that its benchmark rate could rise to higher-than-expected levels next year.Metal markets were battered by a sharp rise in U.S. interest rates this year, as higher yields drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.With the Fed signaling no immediate end to its rate hiking cycle, this trend is likely to continue in the near-term. Markets are awaiting more cues from the central bank next week.Still, positive signals from China helped industrial metals. Copper prices shrugged off initial losses and rose 0.7% on Tuesday, while nickel prices rallied 1.2%.Copper futures were flat around $3.8213 a pound in early Asian trade on Wednesday.Several major Chinese cities scaled back COVID-linked movement curbs and testing mandates in recent days, amid growing public ire towards the government’s strict zero-COVID policy.Story continuesWhile markets are now positioning for an eventual withdrawal of the policy, such a scenario may be delayed, given that China is experiencing its worst COVID outbreak in terms of daily infections.Still, the prospect of a Chinese reopening spurred a strong recovery in industrial metals, given that the country is one of the world’s largest commodity importers.Related ArticlesGold pinned below $1,800 as economic uncertainty, strong dollar weighOil languishes below $80 as recession fears outweigh tighter supplyUkraine appears to show ability to strike far inside Russia]"

232,5f41b0a4-7f9f-3655-9363-ec0f1c028bed,MAR,2022-12-07,COLUMN-Tin must tame its wildness to meet coming demand surge: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-tin-must-tame-wildness-141712237.html,1670336232,STORY,['HG=F'],"[By Andy HomeLONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The world is going to need another 50,000 tonnes of tin per year by 2030 to meet a looming surge in demand, according to the International Tin Association (ITA).Tin is an often overlooked critical mineral, commonly associated with the humble tin can, even though packaging today accounts for only 12% of global usage. Almost half the tin consumed every year is now used as a solder in circuit boards.The faster the world moves towards the internet-of-things, the more tin will be needed to glue the expanding metaverse together.Tin will also benefit from the green energy transition thanks to its use in solar panels and batteries, both lead-acid and lithium-ion.The additional production required to feed the coming demand boom is a big ask of a sector that currently produces around 380,000 tonnes per year of primary refined metal.A recent history of extreme price volatility and growing resource nationalism in Indonesia, the world's largest tin exporter, add to the challenge.ROLLERCOASTER RIDE SLOWS...FOR NOWThe ITA estimates the tin production sector needs around $1.4 billion of investment to deliver 50,000 tonnes per year more tin by the end of the decade.It's a relatively modest amount, equivalent to around one medium-sized copper mine, but investors have in the past been wary of a market prone to extreme swings in price.This year has been a particularly wild ride, London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month tin imploding from a record high of $51,000 per tonne in March to a two-year low of $17,350 in November before bouncing to a current $24,430.Tin's spin from boom to bust is in part down to COVID-19.Key producers in Asia and South America were hit hard by lockdowns and quarantines, output at the world's top 10 operators sliding by 13% over 2020 and 2021. Demand simultaneously exploded as locked-down populations splurged on consumer electronics to pass the time.Both drivers have gone into reverse this year, producers lifting output just as demand for consumer goods abates.Story continuesTin users expect demand to contract by around 0.6% in 2022 after stellar growth of 7.6% last year, according to the ITA's annual survey.The shift in fundamentals, however, has been sharply accentuated by speculative flows on both London and Shanghai markets.Investment fund positioning on the LME swivelled from record long in March to record short in October, equivalent to some 20,000 tonnes of net selling, which is a lot in what is one of the exchange's less liquid contracts.Too much rather than too little liquidity is the problem in Shanghai, where volumes and market open interest surged as the price collapsed, suggesting a mass bear attack.The subsequent recovery rally has generated a lot of churn on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) tin contract with volumes hitting a record monthly high of 3.98 million lots in November. But market open interest also remains elevated at 98,474 contracts, implying the bears are largely holding their ground.Tin moved onto the investment radar in China last year with a step-change in activity on the ShFE contract. Heightened speculative activity in what remains a small physical market comes with the potential for more price turbulence.INDONESIAN UNCERTAINTYIndonesia's talk of banning exports of tin ingot injects significant fundamental uncertainty into the speculative mix.The country exported 75,000 tonnes of refined tin last year with shipments running 8% higher through the first 10 months of this year. It is the world's biggest supplier outside China.The government wants to replicate its success in the nickel sector, where a ban on exports of unprocessed ore generated a build-out of value-add processing capacity.The key difference with tin, however, is that the Indonesian authorities spent much of the last decade tightening export rules such that what leaves the country is already in high-purity refined form.A move further downstream requires more advanced technology to produce solder or tin chemicals.State producer PT Timah needs around two years to develop its existing tin chemical facility and longer to secure markets, Alwin Albar, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Tin Exporters, told a parliamentary hearing.No date for any ban or restrictions has yet been set as the government studies potential time-lines.But the threat of disruption is already impacting market dynamics with Chinese buyers trying to get ahead of any change in export rules.China imported 22,600 tonnes of refined tin in the first 10 months of the year with Indonesian metal accounting for 19,000 tonnes. That's more than China imported from Indonesia over 2020 and 2021 combined.Higher imports have helped Shanghai stocks rebuild to 4,708 tonnes from a meagre 1,260 at the start of 2022.But it's noticeable that LME inventory has started sliding again as Indonesian metal gets diverted to China. After peaking at 5,160 tonnes in September, headline LME tin stocks have fallen to 3,075 tonnes with 535 tonnes awaiting physical load-out.DESPERATELY SEEKING STABILITYNew tin projects aren't viable at a price of $18,000 per tonne. Nor is a significant amount of the artisanal mining that plays a big part in the global supply picture.But they don't need a price of $50,000 either. An ideal scenario for new projects would be a stable $25,000-30,000 range, Thomas Bünger, Chief Executive of First Tin, told the ITA's Investing in Tin seminar.Most tin producers would probably agree and the market could really do with a breather after the price swings of the last two years.Unfortunately, the combination of high speculative activity on the Shanghai market and possible disruption to Indonesian exports suggests the current calm may not last long.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters(Editing by David Evans)]"

These markets are not only poised to see the strongest combined growth in home sales and listing prices in the coming year, but up to this point they have seen lower price increases, a relatively smaller affordability crunch than other markets across the U.S.Top Markets of 2023Mainly concentrated in mid-size markets east of the Mississippi, with local industries tied to manufacturing, education, healthcare and government, this year's top 10, in rank order, are Hartford-West Hartford, Conn., El Paso, Texas, Louisville, Ky., Worcester, Mass., Buffalo-Cheektowaga N.Y., Augusta-Richmond County, Ga., Grand Rapids-Wyoming, Mich., Columbia, S.C., Chattanooga, Tenn., and Toledo, Ohio. (See below for the full ranking of the 100 largest U.S. markets.)Home sales across the top 10 markets are forecasted to grow by 5.2% year-over-year in 2022, whereas the national homes sale projection is for declining sales (-14.1%). Additionally, average home prices in the top 10 are expected to increase 7.3% – compared to 5.4% for the U.S. as a whole.At a time when housing costs are a concern for many, these areas offer relative affordability, having experienced less of a price surge than other extremely hot, pandemic-era markets. They also have a greater share of homeowners who own their homes outright, without a mortgage, giving more residents equity to build on. In the top 10 markets, about 23% of housing inventory is affordable at the median income level, compared to just 17% of affordable homes nationally. Better affordability offers some insulation from the impact of rising mortgage rates.Story continues""As many households keep a close watch on their spending, we expect these top housing markets to be in relatively high demand,"" says Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""We've seen lower price increases, more general affordability and more use of government-backed mortgage products for veterans, first-time and minority buyers in these top markets, providing opportunities for all home buyers to stretch their homebuying dollars. Many of these areas flew under the radar in the pandemic frenzy, and are now well-positioned to bubble up with solid job prospects without the big-city price tag.Top Markets Sidestepped Steep Prices of 2022This year's top 10 housing markets didn't get as caught up in the wild buying frenzy – and price increases – of 2022 as other areas. Sale prices in the 12 months ending August 2022 increased by 10.5% on a year-over-year basis, compared to a growth rate of 12.6% for all 100 largest metros. The top markets have also seen less of a dip in sales in recent months, with sales declining by 9.1% year-over-year, compared to an average decline of 12.3% for all 100 metro areas.""Made in America"" Mid-Sized Metros Poised to Bubble Up Representing a shift from remote-work and tech-industry influenced home buying, this year's top markets have a renewed focus on domestic industry and trade. The pandemic exposed an achilles heel of the far-flung supply chains that had become the norm, namely, that logistics can be disrupted by a wide array of events. This has renewed corporate, government, and consumer focus in these markets where ""Made in America"" happens.On average, these mid-sized metros employ a higher proportion of workers in manufacturing, government, education and healthcare jobs relative to the 100 largest US metros, while jobs in tech, professional services, information technology and leisure/hospitality are less common in these areas. Having largely avoided the pandemic housing boom that we saw in other markets, home buyers in the top markets can find solid job prospects and affordable housing options.Attractive to Out-Of-Town BuyersAlmost half of the buyers looking at the top 10 markets are from areas outside those states. For example, in Hartford, Conn., with a median price of $375,000 in October 2022, homebuyers from New York, Boston and Washington, DC, were leading the wave of out-of-state views in the third quarter of 2022, finding a significant value proposition compared not only to the high price of houses in New York City ($670,000), but also the national median ($425,000). With remote work opportunities still robust, and affordability top of mind, these markets will continue to draw buyers from out of state.Buyers Take Advantage of Government-Backed Loans Home sales in the top 10 metros also tend to leverage more government-backed mortgage products such as VA loans and FHA loans. Between Jan.-Aug. 2022, the share of mortgaged-sales with a VA loan was 9.4% in the top 10 markets vs. 7.5% among all the 100 markets reviewed. These types of loans help buyers safely enter the market with lower down payments and often slightly lower mortgage rates.Realtor.com® 2023 Top Housing Markets1.  Hartford-West Hartford et al, Conn.November 2022 median home price: $372,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +6.5%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +8.5%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +15.0%2.  El Paso, TexasNovember 2022 median home price: $291,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +8.9%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +5.4%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +14.3%3.  Louisville et al, Ky-Ind.November 2022 median home price: $290,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +5.2%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +8.4%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +13.6%4.  Worcester, Mass.-Conn.November 2022 median home price: $447,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +2.5%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +10.6%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +13.1%5.  Buffalo-Cheektowaga et al, N.Y.November 2022 median home price: $240,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +6.3%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +6.0%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +12.3%6.  Augusta-Richmond County, Ga.-S.C.November 2022 median home price: $319,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +6.2%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +5.7%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.9%7.  Grand Rapids-Wy., Mich.November 2022 median home price: $358,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +1.6%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +10.0%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.6%8.  Columbia, S.C.November 2022 median home price: $300,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +7.7%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +3.6%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.3%9.  Chattanooga, Tenn.-Ga.November 2022 median home price: $397,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +2.9%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +8.2%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +11.1%10.  Toledo, OhioNovember 2022 median home price: $161,000Forecasted 2023 home sales change: +4.2%Forecasted 2023 home price change: +6.7%Forecasted 2023 combined sales and price change: +10.9%Realtor.com® 2023 Housing Forecast – 100 Largest U.S. Metros (Ranked)Rank*MetroCombined Sales &amp;

If you want to skip our analysis of the hardware industry and explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now.The hardware and tools industry is an important part of the global economy. It includes the production of tools, machinery, and other related products used in the manufacturing, construction, and maintenance sectors. The industry is diverse and encompasses a variety of products, from hand tools to power tools, garden tools, and other products. The hardware and tools industry is reliant on the manufacturing and construction industries, as the tools and machinery produced are used in these industries. Demand for these products is determined by the size of the projects being undertaken, and the amount of work that needs to be done. As such, the industry is highly cyclical and can be heavily affected by economic changes. The industry has seen significant growth in recent years, due to the increasing demand for construction and manufacturing. This has been driven by population growth, urbanization, and the need for more efficient and cost-effective products. In addition, the growth of the digital economy has led to more demand for digital tools and machines, such as 3D printers and CNC machines. The industry is highly competitive, with companies competing to produce the highest quality tools and products at the lowest costs. In order to remain competitive, companies must constantly innovate and develop new products to keep up with changing consumer preferences. The Hardware Industry: An AnalysisAccording to an industry analysis report by The Business Research Company, the global hardware market was valued at $100.21 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach a value of $109.05 billion by the end of 2022, registering a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%. The global hardware market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% from 2022 through 2026, and reach a valuation of $136.34 billion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe report highlighted that favorable demand trends for metal, and aluminum in particular, coming from the growth of the aerospace industry, are one of the major driving forces fueling the growth of the global hardware industry. Air travel is expected to increase over the forecasted period, therefore driving the demand for metal and consequently the growth of the global hardware industry. However, a potential headwind for the global hardware market is the current geopolitical state of affairs, which has resulted in supply disruptions and a surge in commodity prices. The Ukraine war has caused demand destruction across the globe and is a major hurdle in the growth of the global hardware market as of yet.A key trend that is disrupting the global hardware industry is the rising adoption of industrial automation and the use of robotics in manufacturing to make the process more efficient.

Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of home improvement and building products.

Having previously sold its more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation, windows, and cabinets, what remains are some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products-primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)-are more resilient, lower ticket, and higher margin categories. Both segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit strong pricing power and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair and remodel market. Despite its greatly improved business mix, Masco trades for just 10x next year’s expected earnings, which is a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”6.

As of September 30, Ariel Investments is the dominant investor in the company and has a position worth $146.48 million.Here is what Heartland Advisors had to say about Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Snap-on Inc. (NYSE:SNA) represents a typical holding in that its recent earnings performance, which easily topped analyst expectations, underscored the company’s ability to pass on higher costs to customers. Based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on designs and manufactures professional-grade tools with a particular focus on the automotive-repair industry.While the company was a top performer in the portfolio during the quarter, we believe its current valuation – trading at 12x earnings – leaves plenty of room to run. By comparison, peers trade at 15x earnings even though Snap-on has better margins and operates with less leverage than its competitors.Meanwhile, several secular tailwinds, including an aging fleet of used cars and ever-increasing vehicle complexity, should prove beneficial to Snap-on’s business over the longer term. Snap-on’s history of distributing dividends, which has grown at a 7% CAGR over the past 35 years, underscores its financial discipline and is an added appeal.Like  Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is a hardware stock that is popular among elite hedge funds today. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:14 Best Environmental Stocks To Buy12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy10 Best Gold Stocks with DividendsDisclosure: None. 11 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the hardware industry and explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now.The hardware and tools industry is an important part of the global economy. It includes the production of tools, machinery, and other related products used in the manufacturing, construction, and maintenance sectors. The industry is diverse and encompasses a variety of products, from hand tools to power tools, garden tools, and other products. The hardware and tools industry is reliant on the manufacturing and construction industries, as the tools and machinery produced are used in these industries. Demand for these products is determined by the size of the projects being undertaken, and the amount of work that needs to be done. As such, the industry is highly cyclical and can be heavily affected by economic changes. The industry has seen significant growth in recent years, due to the increasing demand for construction and manufacturing. This has been driven by population growth, urbanization, and the need for more efficient and cost-effective products. In addition, the growth of the digital economy has led to more demand for digital tools and machines, such as 3D printers and CNC machines. The industry is highly competitive, with companies competing to produce the highest quality tools and products at the lowest costs. In order to remain competitive, companies must constantly innovate and develop new products to keep up with changing consumer preferences.

Of those, Greenhaven Associates was the largest investor in the company and disclosed a position worth $99.75 million in the company.7. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of home improvement and building products. The company's revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2022 was $2.20 billion, as reported on October 26, and the company generated an EPS of $0.26. As of December 6, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) is trading at a PE multiple of 13x and is awarding shareholders with a dividend yield of 2.20%. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) is one of the best undervalued and dividend-paying hardware stocks to buy now.On October 27, Truist analyst Keith Hughes updated his price target on Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) to $60 from $70 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst expects the company to outperform in fundamentals over the next year, on a relative basis.At the close of Q3 2022, Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) was spotted on 30 hedge funds' portfolios that disclosed stakes of $369.4 million in the company. Of those, Harris Associates was the top shareholder in the company and held a position worth $251.7 million.Here is what Oakmark Funds had to say about Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is failing to properly reward Masco (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products, for the significant upgrade of its business mix over the past decade. Having previously sold its more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation, windows, and cabinets, what remains are some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products-primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)-are more resilient, lower ticket, and higher margin categories. Both segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit strong pricing power and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair and remodel market. Despite its greatly improved business mix, Masco trades for just 10x next year’s expected earnings, which is a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”6. Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is an American manufacturer and marketer of high-end tools, equipment, diagnostics, and related services for professional users. On November 4, Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) raised its quarterly cash dividend to $1.62 per common share, up 14.1% from the prior dividend of $1.42. The dividend is payable on December 9 to stockholders of record on November 21. The stock is ranked among the best hardware stocks to buy now and, as of December 6, is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.65%.At the close of the third quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds were long Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) and disclosed positions worth $409.16 million in the company. As of September 30, Ariel Investments is the dominant investor in the company and has a position worth $146.48 million.Here is what Heartland Advisors had to say about Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Snap-on Inc. (NYSE:SNA) represents a typical holding in that its recent earnings performance, which easily topped analyst expectations, underscored the company’s ability to pass on higher costs to customers. Based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Snap-on designs and manufactures professional-grade tools with a particular focus on the automotive-repair industry.While the company was a top performer in the portfolio during the quarter, we believe its current valuation – trading at 12x earnings – leaves plenty of room to run. By comparison, peers trade at 15x earnings even though Snap-on has better margins and operates with less leverage than its competitors.Meanwhile, several secular tailwinds, including an aging fleet of used cars and ever-increasing vehicle complexity, should prove beneficial to Snap-on’s business over the longer term. Snap-on’s history of distributing dividends, which has grown at a 7% CAGR over the past 35 years, underscores its financial discipline and is an added appeal.Like  Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is a hardware stock that is popular among elite hedge funds today. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:14 Best Environmental Stocks To Buy12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy10 Best Gold Stocks with DividendsDisclosure: None. 11 Best Hardware Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NVIDIA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA Is NVIDIA Still Cheap?NVIDIA is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 66.05x is currently well-above the industry average of 16.56x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of NVIDIA look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 67%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? NVDA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into NVIDIA, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

If you want to see more best AI stocks, go directly to 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.AI, which stands for artificial intelligence, is already helping companies make better decisions. For retailers, AI is helping price items so companies sell more items. For internet companies, artificial intelligence is helping companies sell more ads more efficiently. For banks, the technology is helping financial institutions make better loans.For the future, AI will likely make possible many new technologies that could benefit society. For the car industry, AI could make possible autonomous driving that could lower costs. For the education industry, it could offer even better personalized learning that could make education more efficient. For the pharmaceutical industry, AI could help create new medicines that improve the lives of billions.Given how transformative AI could be, PwC estimates worldwide GDP will be 14% higher by the end of the decade thanks to AI as the technology increases productivity gains.For the decades beyond 2030, it is likely AI's contribution will be even greater. In the future, AI progress could accelerate if quantum computing ever becomes feasible. With quantum computing, computers can do certain tasks far faster than any traditional computer can and the faster computing could help AI be even more productive.Given the vast potential of AI, many of the world's leading tech companies are working on making the technology better.Some companies like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) are working on building quantum computers while others like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are working on building more efficient semiconductors that power machine learning algorithms. Yet others like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are working on building autonomous driving vehicles.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone. As a result, demand for many companies has declined and the broader market has declined.Story continuesYear to date, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.6% and the Nasdaq has declined 29% year to date. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Advanced AI Companies, we picked 10 leading tech companies that did AI research.Given which company is more advanced than another is subjective, we decided to use market capitalization as a way to rank the best AI stocks since a company having a larger market capitalization can generally mean it has more potential resources to perform AI research.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.For those of you interested, also check out 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.10 Most Advanced AI Companies10.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a leading tech company that does a lot of AI research that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9.

(NYSE:CRM) is an enterprise cloud company that offers its customers AI that helps them better predict business outcomes, augments business processes, and better handle customer service. Partly as a result of its AI software, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) sales and earnings have increased substantially over the years.For the future, it's likely that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) will continue to improve its AI offerings given that the company spent $4.47 billion in total research and development expense in fiscal year 2022, up from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. 117 hedge funds in our database owned shares of Salesforce, Inc.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Market Capitalization as of 12/5: $408.61 billionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading semicoductor company that could benefit from the growth of AI in the future given its GPUs can speed up computational processes for machine learning. Baron Funds described NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI potential in a Q3 2022 investor letter,NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.As of December 5, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $408.61 billion, ranking #5 on our list of best AI stocks.Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc.

And we look forward to expanding this work in the years to come as TSMC forms new and deeper roots in America,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a speech.Also joining Biden at the facility's opening ceremony was TSMC founder Morris Chang, chipmaker Micron Technology Inc CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, among others.The plant, scheduled to be operational in 2024, will make a more advanced chip than initially announced.TSMC's Taipei-listed shares were flat in early trade on Wednesday following the announcement, tracking the broader market.TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a leading supplier to major U.S. hardware manufacturers. Its $40 billion funding for the two facilities is the company's largest investment outside of Taiwan.Story continues""Bringing TSMC's investment to the United States is a masterstroke and a game-changing development for the industry,"" Nvidia's Huang said in remarks prepared for Tuesday's event.TSMC's expanded investment in Arizona is the latest in a string of major investments announced by chipmakers since the CHIPS and Science Act passed this summer. These include International Business Machines Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Wolfspeed Inc.TSMC said it would build a second facility nearby to produce so-called ""3 nanometer"" chips by 2026, the most advanced currently in production.TSMC also said it was planning to build an industrial water reclamation plant. Chip making is a water-intensive process, and Arizona, which is largely desert, is increasingly struggling with water shortages.TSMC's Liu said its Phoenix factories are expected to create 13,000 high-tech jobs, including 4,500 under TSMC and the rest filled by suppliers.Biden has sought to boost semiconductor production after the pandemic caused supply chain problems that led to shortages of chips for vehicles and many other items.U.S. semiconductor production accounts for just 12% of the global total, down from 37% two decades ago, said a White House report on supply chain problems last year.Taiwan's dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cellphones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up military pressure to assert its sovereignty claims.China claims Taiwan as its territory but the democratically elected government in Taipei rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.The $52.7 billion Chips and Science Act, signed into law by Biden in August, is aimed at preventing a resurgence of supply chain woes.Biden's trip to Arizona marks ""a significant milestone that TSMC is reaching in bringing the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.,"" said Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council.Biden's victory in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election helped catapult him to the White House. Republican Donald Trump had won the state in 2016.Biden has said he intends to seek a second four-year term in 2024.

HOLX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its continued strength in the Breast Health arm. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance and its growth initiatives are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and revenues impacted by COVID-19-related uncertainties are a headwind.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 1.4% compared with 24.4% decline of the industry and 16.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of medical imaging systems and surgical products, catering to women’s healthcare needs, has a market capitalization of $18.47 billion. The company projects 15.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 46.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Breast Health: Hologic has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm over the past few months, raising our optimism. The company is currently focusing on expanding its strategy to diversify business across the patient continuum of care. It has also launched new software products based on its artificial intelligence investments and has strengthened its interventional franchise via the Brevera relaunch.In November, Hologic’s 3Dimensions mammography system was awarded EUREF Type Test certification by the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services.Growth Initiatives: We are optimistic about Hologic’s adoption of a few significant strategies over the past few years to streamline its operations and reduce the cost of revenues. The company has invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where management has recognized a good return. Hologic has launched a cadence of products, including 3DQuorum Imaging Technology, powered by Genius AI in the United States and LOCalizer radiofrequency identification tag for long-term placement in Europe.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: We are upbeat about Hologic’s better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The company saw a robust uptick in organic revenues in its GYN Surgical business as the company registered procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from the new business lines. Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Diagnostics revenues also improved on a reported basis and at a constant exchange rate.DownsidesCOVID-19 Revenue Uncertainty: Hologic is one of the key players working to produce or have produced tests for COVID-19. This may lead to customer diversion, including governmental and quasi-governmental entities, away from Hologic and toward other companies. Hologic is also witnessing a decline in its COVID-19 testing revenues following the vaccine rollout. This might significantly pull down its revenues.Stiff Competition: Hologic operates in a highly-competitive industry, where its mammography, related products and subsystems compete worldwide with products offered by several competitors. In the United States, few other key players have received the FDA’s approval for their products, which has put additional competitive pressure on Hologic.Estimate TrendHologic has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.9% south to $3.46.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $962.2 million, suggesting a 34.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV and McKesson Corporation MCK.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

CTLT completed the expansion of its clinical supply facility in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in Shanghai, China. The project, which has significantly expanded the site area, enabled the installation of additional refrigerated (between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius) and deep-frozen (between minus 70 and minus 90 degrees Celsius) storage and secondary packaging capabilities to be expanded.Catalent’s senior management team was expected to showcase the facilities at the site and host workshops on clinical supply management and new GMP policies at two recently-concluded customer events, marking the completion of the expansion.The latest expansion of the clinical supply facility is expected to solidify Catalent’s foothold in the growing clinical trials space in the Asia-Pacific region.Significance of the Latest ExpansionThe Waigaoqiao facility is one of two clinical supply facilities that Catalent operates in Shanghai (the other being in Tangzhen, outside the FTZ). The facilities, in unison, provide sponsors with optimized supply solutions for studies undertaken in China and the Asia-Pacific region and globally through Catalent’s extensive network. These include clinical supply management and clinical returns and destruction, among others.Per management, since China is the fastest-growing clinical trials market in the Asia-Pacific region, Catalent continues to invest and expand its facilities and services to offer reliable, flexible and integrated customer support. These additional capabilities are expected to increase the site’s ability to support clinical trials for advanced therapeutics, which often demand specialized storage and handling capabilities.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global clinical trial supplies market is anticipated to reach $5.7 billion by 20276 from $3.6 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 9.7%. Factors like rising research and development expenditure in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and the increasing number of clinical trials worldwide are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest site expansion will likely provide a significant impetus to Catalent in the clinical trials space in the Asia-Pacific region.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Catalent announced a new license agreement with Exelixis, Inc., under which Catalent’s Redwood Bioscience subsidiary will grant Exelixis an exclusive license to three target programs with lead antibody and/or antibody-drug conjugate candidates.In November, Catalent announced its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, where it saw year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment. Catalent had undertaken some facility expansion activities during the reported quarter besides inking some strategic deals in the past few months. These developments raised our optimism about the stock.In October, Catalent announced a $12-million expansion program to increase biologics cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) analytical capabilities at its Kansas City, MO facility. The project was expected to add two new analytical development laboratories to support the growing demands of assay development for both traditional biologic and advanced biologic modality programs.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 58.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 28.1% fall and the S&amp;P 500's 14.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Catalent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Among the automakers that revealed monthly sales numbers, Toyota, Mazda, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru and Volvo registered year-over-year gains, while Ford and Honda posted a decline in sales.  Per Motor Intelligence, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales reached 14.4 million in November, up from 12.9 million recorded in the year-ago period but down from 15.3 million in October.On the news front, Lithia Motors LAD boosted its portfolio with the acquisition of Meador CDJR dealership in Dallas-Fort Worth. Cummins Inc. CMI also powered its prospects with the purchase of Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. Banking on the soaring popularity of green vehicles, legacy automakers, including General Motors GM and Ford F, announced the investment of additional funds in their EV facilities to boost production. Stellantis STLA and Qinomic partnered for sustainable electric retrofitting solutions for LCVs. The company also announced that it would launch Ram 1500 BEV Concept and Peugeot Inception Concept at the CES event in 2023.Last Week’s Top StoriesLithia bolstered its footprint in Texas with the purchase of Meador Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram (“CDJR”), the second largest CDJR dealership in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Meador CDJR is in Fort Worth and serves the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area. Lithia expects the dealership to generate more than $200 million in annualized revenues, bringing LAD's total expected annualized revenues acquired in 2022 to more than $3.3 billion. The acquisition is part of LAD's nationwide network expansion initiative under the company's 2025 plan, where it has set a target to reach $50 billion in revenues and EPS in the range of $55-$65.Lithia’s strategic buyouts are helping the auto retailer increase its market share and boost its portfolio. The spree of acquisitions brought Lithia's total expected annualized revenues acquired to $7 billion in 2021, keeping it ahead of schedule laid out in the five-year plan rolled out in July 2020. Its total expected annualized revenues acquired in 2022 have reached $3.3 billion.Story continuesCummins announced that it completed the acquisition of Siemens Commercial Vehicles business, a top supplier of high-performance electric drive systems for commercial vehicles. The acquired business will report through Cummins New Power business unit.Cummins is enthusiastic about the acquisition and looking forward to bringing innovation in its key technologies. The buyout also reflects another key milestone as it bolsters Cummins’ strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.The acquisition contributes to Cummins’ capabilities in direct drive and transmission-based remote mount electric motors, inverters, software and related services, critical for the next generation of electric powertrains. The buyout will also add nearly 200 employees, primarily in Germany, China and the United States, which will expand its scope of offering global customers with a wider range of electrified product solutions across commercial vehicle applications.Ford announced plans to invest an additional $180 million in its Halewood EV powertrain facility in northern England. In October, F announced an investment of $280 million to transform its Halewood transmission facility to build electric power units for future European Ford passenger and commercial EVs. Production is scheduled to begin in 2024. The current flow of fresh funds will boost annual production at the plant to 420,000 units per year, up from 250,000 previously, an increase of 70% in factory output. This, in turn, will supply powertrains to many European Ford models by 2026.Ford’s much-celebrated Mustang Mach-E SUV reached an important milestone last week as the company produced its 150,000th order since the start of production in late 2020. The all-electric Mustang Mach-E was globally launched in 2019 and became one of the several highly anticipated EV releases and ushered in a new generation of vehicles. Since then, it has become one of the best-selling EVs in the United States and globally.Stellantis and Qinomic, a high-tech company specializing in innovative and sustainable solutions, are partnering for mobility to create a proof of concept. The aim is to convert internal combustion engine light commercial vehicles (LCV) to electric drivetrains while maintaining OEM quality and specifications like safety, durability and type approval.Stellantis is set to launch Ram 1500 Revolution Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Concept and the Peugeot Inception Concept in early January. Equipped with advanced technology features and the BEV-by-design body-on-frame architecture, the Ram Revolution BEV Concept is a pioneering and futuristic model promising to bring a breakthrough in the pickup truck segment. The Peugeot Inception Concept brings the next generation of cockpit platforms to re-invent the whole automobile experience, redesign the interior space and reshape driving gestures around the next generation of the Peugeot i-Cockpit.General Motors and LG energy will invest another $275 million in the battery plant in Tennessee. In April 2021, the companies had announced an investment of $2.3 billion to build a 2.8 million sq ft facility. Production at the plant will start in late 2023.The additional $275 million investment is likely to boost the output by more than 40%. It is expected to ramp up the capacity from 35 gigawatt-hours to 50 GWh once the plant is fully functional. Tim Herrick, GM’s vice president of EV Launch Excellence said, “By expanding battery cell output at Ultium Cells Spring Hill, this investment will help GM offer customers the broadest EV portfolio of any automaker and further solidifies our path toward U.S. EV leadership.”GM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the last week and six-month period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Next in the Auto Space?Industry watchers will track China vehicle sales data for November 2022, which is likely to be released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers this week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The package includes a 6% wage increase, a €4,000 one-time bonus and the ability to participate in a stock compensation plan, which enables workers to gain from the company’s profits.The Rotterdam refinery was shut down last month due to a sudden steam outage. The refinery workers have been threatening to call a strike unless the company raises its pay offer to employees.Workers at the refinery started a work-to-rule action as BP was unable to reach a salary settlement. Work-to-rule action means workers refuse to perform duties beyond those mentioned in employment contracts.The Rotterdam facility is one of the largest oil refineries in Europe, producing approximately 400,000 barrels per year. It accounts for almost 3% of northern Europe’s refining capacity. Any delays to the refinery’s restart could have worsened the diesel crisis in Europe.Workers partially restarted the refinery as salary negotiations were ongoing. One of two crude distillation units was already restarted, while the workers kept the Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit offline, which produces light ends such as gasoline.A delay in the refinery restart came as Europe is rushing for diesel supply and stocking up on Russia diesel before an EU ban begins in February next year.

251,0f783c51-ba00-3b97-a75d-cf2dc1568ad5,CMCSA,2022-12-07,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Comcast, Charter Communications and Rogers Communication",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-comcast-100010740.html,1670407210,STORY,"['CHTR', 'CMCSA', '^GSPC', 'RCI']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 7, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Comcast CMCSA, Charter Communications CHTR and Rogers Communication RCI.Industry: Cable TVLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2025666/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-challenging-cable-television-industryThe Zacks Cable Television industry is witnessing a rise in cord-cutting on pay-TV options, including cable TV and satellite TV, due to intensifying competition from over-the-top service providers’ innovative content offerings. Focus on providing bundled offerings and on-demand programming content that cater to changing consumer behavior bodes well for streaming players.Despite stiff competition, Cable Television industry players are benefiting from the spike in the COVID-led demand for high-speed broadband. Strong demand for WiFi devices and wireless Internet has been a growth factor. Increased consumption of media due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns and shelter-at-home guidelines has been a key catalyst for industry participants like Comcast, Charter Communications and Rogers Communication.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Cable Television industry primarily comprises companies that provide integrated data, video and voice services. Industry participants offer pay-TV services, including Internet-based streaming content. These companies provide equipment such as satellite dish, digital set-top receivers and remote controls.Typically, cable companies either build their network backbone or lease physical access to the network backbone from telecommunication companies. These companies purchase licenses to provide subscribers access to cable television channels owned by programmers and distributed over the network backbone. Cable companies also sell advertising spots on their channels. The industry requires a high capital expenditure on infrastructure to enhance its services. The industry is highly regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Cable IndustrySkinny Bundles, Original Content Driving Growth:Cable television’s ability to generate ad revenues outside traditional TV platforms, such as websites and any digitally-consumed platform, provides increased scope for target-based advertising. Nevertheless, consumers’ unfavorable disposition, particularly toward advertising, has hit industry participants hard.The growing consumer preference for digital and subscription services instead of linear pay-TV and rental or outright purchase has compelled industry players to alter their business models. Cable television companies are now offering a variety of alternative packages, including skinny bundles, which are delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings. These companies are also innovating in terms of original content to be competitive against streaming service providers.High-Speed Internet Demand Key Catalyst:The growing demand for high-speed Internet, including broadband, has aided cable television industry participants like Comcast and Charter. Improving Internet speed is fueling the demand for high-quality video and the trend of binge viewing.Further, a strengthening broadband ecosystem in international markets, along with the proliferation of smart TVs, is anticipated to drive growth. Also, the surging work-from-home trend and online-learning practice owing to coronavirus-induced quarantines and lockdowns have boosted Internet usage, thus supporting industry participants.Cord Cutting and Matured PayTV Industry Hurting Prospects:The cable television industry is witnessing the rapid evolution of distribution platforms as well as embracing new players and advanced technologies. Declining profits of residential video services due to rising programming costs and retransmission fees have made survival difficult for traditional companies.Additionally, the heightened need for on-demand content has led to the mushrooming of streaming service providers, making it particularly tricky for traditional cable television companies to maintain a viewer base. Furthermore, the traditional pay-TV industry is maturing with widespread consolidation. Moreover, residential voice service revenues are declining on the rising shift to wireless voice services.Softness in Advertising Demand Impeding Business Growth:The challenge with TV ads is that marketers have difficulty getting actionable metrics and insights such as attribution data. At this time, marketers must look for outside-the-box solutions to extract conversion data from offline media.TV has taken a secondary role in most marketing strategies due to the growing influence of digital marketing. Many marketers are increasing ad spending on digital mediums due to their unmatched ability to deliver personalized messages that are easy to measure. Cable TV players are set to face competition for ad dollars from streaming service providers like Netflix and Disney, which are raising prices and introducing cheaper ad-supported packages now that their subscriber growth has slowed.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Cable Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #208, which places it in the bottom 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Dec 31, 2021, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2022 has moved down 1.3%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector, S&amp;P 500The Zacks Cable Television industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 33.2% over this period compared with the broader sector’s decline of 33.1%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 14.6% during the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, a commonly used multiple for valuing cable companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 7.12X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.77X and the sector’s 8.43X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.3X, as low as 6.23X and at the median of 10.75X.3 Cable Stocks In FocusComcast: This Philadelphia, PA-based company is riding on an expanding broadband subscriber base and strong momentum in the wireless business apart from advertising revenue growth. Its strategy to provide high-speed Internet at an affordable price plays a pivotal role in providing connectivity and improving customer experience.Moreover, coronavirus-led increased media consumption and the work-from-home and online-learning wave bode well for Comcast’s Internet business.

The consensus mark for 2022 earnings has moved south by 0.8% to $31.56 per share in the past 30 days.Rogers Communication: This Zacks Rank #3 company continues to benefit from Internet subscriber additions and the shift of Internet users to higher-usage tiers.

The result is a hardware breakthrough that allows all viewers to easily navigate and enjoy all the entertainment, news, and information Xfinity has to offer.""For more than 60 years, Comcast has pioneered advancements in entertainment and connectivity and delivered industry-shaping experiences to customers,"" says Fraser Stirling, Global Chief Product Officer at Comcast. ""Our long-standing commitment to accessibility has unlocked profound innovation across our portfolio time and time again - shaping everything we do from the way we design our products, to the content we create, to the experiences we deliver. Inclusive design, for us, is just better design.""The Most Accessible Remote to DateInnovation is powered by a deep understanding of consumer preferences and needs. That's why Comcast's design team worked side-by-side with the disability community to test and refine the creation of its new Large Button Voice Remote. Accessibility features and functionality were the top priorities throughout the remote's development. The result of a rigorous research and design process is a one-of-a-kind remote unlike anything available on the market today-one that combines high functionality with elegant design to offer something for everyone to love.Story continuesNew Horizons, Inc., an organization that provides housing and support services for people with physical disabilities participated in the research and testing. Carol Fitzgerald, CEO of New Horizons says, ""Technology can help level the playing field for people with disabilities. When companies like Comcast design products and experiences with accessibility at the forefront, they not only create better products for everyone, but they also help to unlock more independence for millions of people with disabilities. We're very proud to have been part of the creation of the Large Button Voice Remote which is truly a game-changing innovation.""Features and Functionality That Enhance AccessibilityThe collaboration behind Comcast's new Large Button Voice Remote helped create a world-class experience, from end to end, for people with vision, mobility, and dexterity impairments.Easy NavigationAt the heart of the remote is Comcast's award-winning voice control technology. Users can find what they want-and find it faster-using voice commands to change channels, search for shows, get recommendations, and more. The remote also includes a prominent accessibility shortcut button that offers quick, easy connection to personalized X1 and Flex accessibility settings. With this button, users can enable popular accessibility features like Comcast's Talking Guide, closed captions, large text capabilities, audio description, and more, to suit their needs.Enhanced VisualsLocating and navigating the Large Button Voice Remote is easier than ever, thanks to its large backlit buttons and high contrast colors. Plus, the increased font size on all the remote's buttons improves readability.Precision FeaturesIn addition to its enhanced functionality, the Large Button Voice Remote's physical design provides remarkable ease of use. A removable wrist strap allows for more precise handling and control. An innovative battery compartment features a rubber pull tab design and ""press to slide"" battery cover making it easier to change batteries. An elevated, flat-back design allows for increased stability when the remote is used on a flat surface like a wheelchair tray or with other assistive devices.Accessible Set-UpThe inclusive packaging for the Large Button Voice Remote uses large typography and tactile features, including braille and an embossed arrow near the package's opening, to orient users who are visually impaired. The remote comes with an audio guide that automatically begins playing step-by-step instructions upon opening-an industry-first that allows users to pair the remote to their television in less than a minute. The remote also uses haptic vibrations to create a multi-sensory experience that alerts users when pairing is complete.Leveraging Comcast's Global Technology Platform to Improve AccessibilityThe new Large Button Voice Remote leverages voice search technology within Comcast's global technology platform, enabling customers to easily navigate the interface and discover programming across hundreds of networks and streaming services with just the sound of their voice. Processing more than 40 million commands a day in 5 different languages, Comcast's global technology platform powers one of the largest and best voice engines for content discovery available anywhere. Combined with the work Comcast announced earlier this year to integrate accessibility features into its next-generation platform architecture, the remote further embeds inclusive design into the ethos of the company, empowering its global teams and the broader development community to create better, more innovative experiences for everyone.Available at No Additional CostX1 and Flex customers can request a remote, at no additional charge, through Comcast's Accessibility Support Center, which was one of the nation's first call centers specifically created to support customers with disabilities. Comcast's Accessibility Support Center is now home to more than 140 agents specially trained on Comcast products and services, support for third-party assistive devices, and information related to Braille or large print bills. Comcast also offers support in American Sign Language-the fourth most-used language in the United States-through a partnership with Connect Direct, a subsidiary of Communication Service for the Deaf.The Xfinity Large Button Voice Remote is another example of Comcast's longstanding commitment to accessibility. From unveiling the nation's first Talking Guide back in 2013, to the recent expansion of the Xfinity Web Adaptive Remote, which was named a ""Best Inventions of 2019"" by Time Magazine, these groundbreaking technological innovations continue to unlock more equitable access to entertainment, news, and information for people with disabilities.

254,d43eb015-e616-3b21-bfb7-c446ab395c3c,CMCSA,2022-12-07,3 Stocks to Watch From the Challenging Cable Television Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-challenging-cable-141802079.html,1670336282,STORY,"['CHTR', 'CMCSA', '^GSPC', 'RCI']","[The Zacks Cable Television industry is witnessing a rise in cord-cutting on pay-TV options, including cable TV and satellite TV, due to intensifying competition from over-the-top service providers’ innovative content offerings. Focus on providing bundled offerings and on-demand programming content that cater to changing consumer behavior bodes well for streaming players.Despite stiff competition, Cable Television industry players are benefiting from the spike in the COVID-led demand for high-speed broadband. Strong demand for WiFi devices and wireless Internet has been a growth factor. Increased consumption of media due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns and shelter-at-home guidelines has been a key catalyst for industry participants like Comcast CMCSA, Charter Communications CHTR and Rogers Communication RCI.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Cable Television industry primarily comprises companies that provide integrated data, video and voice services. Industry participants offer pay-TV services, including Internet-based streaming content. These companies provide equipment such as satellite dish, digital set-top receivers and remote controls. Typically, cable companies either build their network backbone or lease physical access to the network backbone from telecommunication companies. These companies purchase licenses to provide subscribers access to cable television channels owned by programmers and distributed over the network backbone. Cable companies also sell advertising spots on their channels. The industry requires a high capital expenditure on infrastructure to enhance its services. The industry is highly regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Cable IndustrySkinny Bundles, Original Content Driving Growth: Cable television’s ability to generate ad revenues outside traditional TV platforms, such as websites and any digitally-consumed platform, provides increased scope for target-based advertising. Nevertheless, consumers’ unfavorable disposition, particularly toward advertising, has hit industry participants hard. Further, the growing consumer preference for digital and subscription services instead of linear pay-TV and rental or outright purchase has compelled industry players to alter their business models. Cable television companies are now offering a variety of alternative packages, including skinny bundles, which are delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings. These companies are also innovating in terms of original content to be competitive against streaming service providers.High-Speed Internet Demand Key Catalyst: The growing demand for high-speed Internet, including broadband, has aided cable television industry participants like Comcast and Charter. Improving Internet speed is fueling the demand for high-quality video and the trend of binge viewing. Further, a strengthening broadband ecosystem in international markets, along with the proliferation of smart TVs, is anticipated to drive growth. Also, the surging work-from-home trend and online-learning practice owing to coronavirus-induced quarantines and lockdowns have boosted Internet usage, thus supporting industry participants.Cord Cutting and Matured PayTV Industry Hurting Prospects: The cable television industry is witnessing the rapid evolution of distribution platforms as well as embracing new players and advanced technologies. Declining profits of residential video services due to rising programming costs and retransmission fees have made survival difficult for traditional companies. Additionally, the heightened need for on-demand content has led to the mushrooming of streaming service providers, making it particularly tricky for traditional cable television companies to maintain a viewer base. Furthermore, the traditional pay-TV industry is maturing with widespread consolidation. Moreover, residential voice service revenues are declining on the rising shift to wireless voice services.Softness in Advertising Demand Impeding Business Growth: The challenge with TV ads is that marketers have difficulty getting actionable metrics and insights such as attribution data. At this time, marketers must look for outside-the-box solutions to extract conversion data from offline media. TV has taken a secondary role in most marketing strategies due to the growing influence of digital marketing. Many marketers are increasing ad spending on digital mediums due to their unmatched ability to deliver personalized messages that are easy to measure. Cable TV players are set to face competition for ad dollars from streaming service providers like Netflix and Disney, which are raising prices and introducing cheaper ad-supported packages now that their subscriber growth has slowed.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Cable Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #208, which places it in the bottom 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Dec 31, 2021, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2022 has moved down 1.3%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector, S&amp;P 500The Zacks Cable Television industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 33.2% over this period compared with the broader sector’s decline of 33.1%.

Its strategy to provide high-speed Internet at an affordable price plays a pivotal role in providing connectivity and improving customer experience.

This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Director Charles Moorman bought US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$84.57 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$78.91. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Charles Moorman was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Oracle insiders own 43% of the company, currently worth about US$91b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Oracle Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Oracle shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Oracle insiders feel good about the company's future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

With quantum computing, computers can do certain tasks far faster than any traditional computer can and the faster computing could help AI be even more productive.Given the vast potential of AI, many of the world's leading tech companies are working on making the technology better.Some companies like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) are working on building quantum computers while others like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are working on building more efficient semiconductors that power machine learning algorithms. Yet others like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are working on building autonomous driving vehicles.2022 has been a challenging year in the markets as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone. As a result, demand for many companies has declined and the broader market has declined.Story continuesYear to date, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.6% and the Nasdaq has declined 29% year to date. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.MethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Advanced AI Companies, we picked 10 leading tech companies that did AI research.Given which company is more advanced than another is subjective, we decided to use market capitalization as a way to rank the best AI stocks since a company having a larger market capitalization can generally mean it has more potential resources to perform AI research.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.For those of you interested, also check out 15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market Cap.10 Most Advanced AI Companies10.

NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.As of December 5, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $408.61 billion, ranking #5 on our list of best AI stocks.Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are leading tech companies that do AI research that many hedge funds in our database were long at the end of the third quarter.Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.Suggested articles:Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksObama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year ReturnsAQR Capital’s Performance, AUM and Top Stock PicksDisclosure: None. 10 Most Advanced AI Companies is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the free market as it pertains to ethical conduct in the US and go directly to 5 Most Ethical Companies in the US. Young people are becoming increasingly awake to the social, historical, climate and financial injustices and choose to give business to, and invest in companies that share their values. Many corporations have responded positively to the development. “Ethical” CapitalismTo give you a quantitative perspective on the corporate ethical turn, Yale School of Management has compiled a list of 138 corporations with extended women’s benefits, not offered by other corporations. Out of these, nearly a third are tech corporations. The most prominent ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In terms of doing business in Russia, over a 1,000 corporations (majority of them American) have left the country after it invaded the neighboring Ukraine. Evidence indicates that the equity market’s reward to the companies for the action far outweighs the potential loss from leaving Russia. On the other hand, companies that are still engaged in business with Russia are being punished by investors. At the sustainability front, many companies have adopted “planet friendly” policies to lower the burden on Earth’s ecosystem and climate. However, most of the corporate sector has been called out several times for “greenwashing” and not actually doing enough. Regardless, the companies we’ve discussed are doing their part for sustainability as well as social and financial justice. ESG’s Impact on a Company’s Financial PerformanceESG refers to the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance. It's a set of standards that impact-investors look at when investing based on values. Stern School of Business carried out a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, done between the period of 2015-2020, and concluded that ESG and corporate financial performance had a statistically significant positive correlation for 58% of the studies. The analysis also discovered that corporate investments in sustainability were actually advantageous in the long-term while having no impact on financial performance in the short-term.Story continuesNow that we have the perspective on the ethical free market, let’s move on to the list of 22 most ethical companies in the US. 22 Most Ethical Companies in the USPhoto by Feri &amp; Tasos on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 22 most ethical companies in the US, we’ve ranked them based on how many times they’ve been hailed as honorees for being ethical up until 2022 by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in assessing ethical businesses.We’ve also mentioned each company’s ESG-risk scores from Sustainalytics, a premier ESG grader.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) and ConocoPhillips (COP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Bank of America have modestly underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (-22.9% vs. -20.4%). The company’s over-dependence on trading revenues for fee income is a key concern. The volatile nature of the capital markets might adversely impact fee income growth.However, Bank of America’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and lagged in one of the trailing four quarters. Its third-quarter 2022 results were primarily aided by higher rates and loan growth. The opening of new financial centers, enhancement in digital capabilities and cost-saving efforts are expected to keep aiding the company’s financials.Moreover, supported by continued loan growth, Bank of America's top line is expected to improve further. Given the rise in interest rates, the company is expected to keep witnessing growth in margins in the near term.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here &gt;&gt;&gt;)T-Mobile's shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+28.5% vs. -10.4%). The company’s industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers is driven by superior 5G network. It is on track to complete the Sprint customer network decommissioning by the year-end.The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. With healthy demand trends, T-Mobile has raised the guidance for 2022 across the board.However, it operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding its profitability. Furthermore, it is engaging in leasing strategy to gain customers, thereby exposing it to credit risk. Debt obligation woes also persist.(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here &gt;&gt;&gt;)ConocoPhillips’s shares have gained +60.1% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry’s gain of +65.2%. The company holds a bulk of acres in the unconventional plays of Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale.

The company recently posted another stellar quarterly report, and despite investor jitters surrounding inflation rates and the global economy, Delta stands out due to robust demand, effective cost control and an incredible balance sheet. Based on its strong fundamentals, Delta could soon regain pre-pandemic profits and valuations.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DAL. Click here to check it out. DAL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DALPeter Lynch Chart of DALDelta has made impressive strides by balancing travel demand and capacity despite the current economic downturn. Focused on providing a premium travel experience for all its customers, Delta was successful in significantly increasing unit revenues even in this difficult period.The company's stock has moved sluggishly in the past year, declining more than 10% in the past six months. It trades at a forward price-sales ratio of just 0.4 , which is more than a 60% discount to sector averages. This is dirt cheap when we consider the superb fundamentals and future outlook.Robust premium cabinet salesDelta Air Lines is one of the leaders in the airline industry and has been for more than a decade. Its fantastic reputation for quality has enabled Delta to become a major premium player in the sector.Nowadays, most of its revenue comes from business travel and leisure travel, which is a significant competitive advantage in the current economic climate. Its primary customer base has effectively increased its travel spending without being hampered by high inflation and slowing economic growth due to the fact that its average customers are wealthier than those of its main competitors.Moreover, the carrier is flying high despite operating at a lower capacity, outperforming its competition and delivering tremendous customer service. Last quarter saw the company deliver record sales with an impressive showing in its premium cabin niche. Sales from premium cabins shot up a handsome 8% compared to the same period in 2019. Delta estimates that sales from its premium cabin could jump 40% by 2024.Story continuesBased on its solid results in recent quarters, Delta has offered solid guidance for its top and bottom lines over the next few years. It has set a target of generating more than $7 in adjusted earnings and $4 billion in free cash flows by 2024, in line with its pre-pandemic results. If it can meet those goals, the stock looks dramatically undervalued.Furthermore, Delta has just struck a strategic deal to boost its revenue stream with American Express (NYSE:AXP). Delta expects to generate $5.5 billion from American Express this year alone and reach $7 billion by 2024.Cost control is improvingDespite posting record revenues in its third quarter, Delta's net income dropped by a hefty amount due to an increase in fuel prices and additional operating expenses with lower capacity. However, Delta's cost pressure is expected to lessen in the quarters ahead as the company regains capacity and overcomes its inefficiencies.A lot has to do with Delta Air Lines' proactive approach toward asset management during the pandemic. In response to the extraordinary challenges that the airline industry faced, Delta stepped up to the plate and overcame many of its difficulties through a masterful display of proactive asset management. Delta's innovative capital-raising efforts included over $9 billion in debt capitalization, its robust SkyMiles loyalty program and sale-and-leaseback measures for its fleet.The airline is confident its cost trajectory will improve substantially in the fourth quarter. Despite operating at 8% to 9% less capacity than three years prior, Delta expects to reduce non-fuel unit cost growth relative to 2019. The improved efficiency will become even more pronounced when Delta (hopefully) returns to pre-pandemic capacity levels next summer, unlocking massive potential savings opportunities for the airline.With over 300 new aircraft on order, Delta is making long-term investments in both future customer experience and fuel efficiency. With these new planes, it can cut costs by replacing more than a third of its fleet in the next five to six years. Delta is working towards building one of the industry's most energy-efficient fleets. Therefore, the future looks bright for this carrier as it successfully weathers one of the most trying points in recent history.TakeawayInvestors are worried about inflation and interest rates crippling the economy. However, not all companies are created equal. Delta's recent results have been spectacular, with its cost trajectory improving substantially. Moreover, demand remains robust and is expected to improve in the upcoming quarters.The last few years were difficult for the airline industry, as the pandemic caused a sharp decline in travel demand. However, Delta has fared relatively well compared to its competitors and is now well-positioned to continue growing in the years to come. The company has made progress to position itself as a premium brand, which is starting to pay off as customers are willing to pay more for a Delta ticket. In addition, Delta has made significant investments in its domestic network, which will help it to better compete against its rivals.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
272,839a4bc1-dc2a-36ac-a5c2-e262d5a1fc49,NTAP,2022-12-07,NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) Will Pay A Dividend Of $0.50,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netapp-nasdaq-ntap-pay-dividend-123624025.html,1670416584,STORY,['NTAP'],"[NetApp, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NTAP) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.50 per share on 25th of January. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.2%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, NetApp was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 24.9% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 46%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendNetApp Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.60 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. NetApp has impressed us by growing EPS at 24% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.NetApp Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think NetApp might even raise payments in the future. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Occidental owes a portion of its big move to its industry. Energy-related stocks have soared in 2022 on the back of diminishing supply caused by a combination of supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.Occidental has also specifically benefited from its massive endorsement from Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, the billionaire affectionately dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha” for his investing prowess.

Hess has a leading position in shale production in North Dakota, but its diverse investments include deepwater production in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas production and supply to Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest in Crypto?With skyrocketing energy prices in 2022, Hess was well positioned to benefit on numerous fronts.Constellation Energy (CEG)Feb. 1, 2022 stock price*: $49.78 (first started trading “regular way” 2/2/22)Dec. 6, 2022 stock price: $90.47$ increase: $40.69% increase: 82%Constellation Energy wasn’t even trading as of year-end 2021, but it certainly made its mark on the market in 2022. Constellation Energy was spun off from its parent company Exelon and began trading the conventional way on Feb. 2, 2022, soaring on its first day.In addition to the tailwinds of being in the right sector in 2022, the company no doubt drew interest from “green” investors, as Constellation Energy is the largest carbon-free energy producer in the United States.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)Dec. 31, 2021 stock price: $63.99Dec. 6, 2022 stock price: $109.82$ increase: $45.83% increase: 72%Yet another company that was propelled to huge gains in 2022 due to rising energy prices was Marathon Petroleum. Analysts think the run isn’t over, slapping a one-year price target of $134.42 on the stock and calling it a “strong buy.”Marathon posted huge revenue and earnings numbers in its recent Q3 earnings report, beating analyst estimates, and it also boosted forward guidance. The diversified energy company operates the nation’s largest refining system, positioning it for future gains.EQT (EQT)Dec. 31, 2021 stock price: $21.81Dec. 6, 2022 stock price: $36.84$ increase: $15.03% increase: 69%EQT may not be the best-known name on the list, but the company is the largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. This type of huge leverage to the energy market helped propel the company’s stock to huge gains YTD in 2022.EQT’s stock dipped a bit in September as it announced a plan to buy out THQ Appalachia I LLC and associated pipeline infrastructure for a whopping $5.2 billion. The $14.6 billion company is still considered undervalued by analysts, who have a consensus “strong buy” on the stock with an average 12-month price target of $61.92.More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Hottest Stocks of 2022]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -12.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has lost 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share, indicating a change of +36.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +282%. This estimate has changed -3.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.43 indicates a change of -23.7% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $37.61 billion and $33.94 billion estimates indicate +42.9% and -9.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

280,e65f32bf-72fd-31cf-9957-afd0cf244cc4,COF,2022-12-07,6 Easiest Credit Cards To Get,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-easiest-credit-cards-110029839.html,1670345783,STORY,['COF-PJ'],"[PeopleImages / Getty ImagesAlthough credit cards are the root of so much toxic debt in America, they can also provide a roadmap back to the path of good credit if your score takes a beating. If you can get approved for a credit card, after all, you can make on-time payments, keep your utilization ratio low and rebuild your reputation among potential lenders. The Catch 22 is that you need good credit to get approved for the credit cards that you need to rebuild your bad credit — or do you?Find: Stimulus Payments Are Coming to These States in OctoberWatch Out: This Credit Score Mistake Could Be Costing Millions of AmericansGOBankingRates has identified six credit cards designed specifically for people with fair credit, bad credit and even no credit at all. Some stand out for their forgiving application standards, while others made their names with rewards and perks that are usually reserved for people with good credit. All, however, are worth a look if you’re wrestling with a subpar score.1. Discover it Student ChromeAll cards marketed to students have lower standards for credit histories and scores than mainstream cards, but Discover it Student Chrome is especially forgiving and especially rewarding. Although you don’t even need a credit score to apply and there is no annual fee, you’ll earn premium perks while you build your credit. This includes up to 2% cash back at Gas Stations and Restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, your cash back will automatically be matched your first year, and you can benefit from a 0% intro APR for six months (then a 15.24% – 24.24% variable APR will apply). All of this on top of earning 1% cash back on all other purchases, which Discover describes as “at school, at home and everywhere in between.”Take Our Poll: Do You Have an Emergency Fund Established?2. Platinum MasterCard from Capitol OneCapital One Platinum consistently ranks as one of the highest-rated cards for people with fair to average credit. It has a low credit score requirement and automatically considers cardholders for a credit limit increase after just six months. The only nagging criticism is the lack of a rewards program, but the card comes with no annual fee and no international transaction fee. Plus, card holders qualify for automatic credit line reviews so you can monitor your score as you go.Story continues3. Capital One Platinum SecuredThis secured card provides a clear and attainable path to improved credit and life with a full-fledged mainstream card. Not only does Capital One report on-time payments to the bureaus, but if you continue to use your card responsibly, you’ll get your deposit back and be upgraded to an unsecured Platinum card. There’s a $0 annual fee and flexible due dates that fit your budget, as well as your schedule.4. First Progress Platinum Elite MasterCard SecuredYou don’t need a credit history or minimum score to get this card, but you will pay an annual fee of $29. In exchange, you’ll be approved with no inquiry, even if you have a discharged bankruptcy on your file. Like all secured cards, this one doesn’t extend credit, but does offer cardholders the chance to “pay 6-months on-time and apply to get a second credit card.” A unique perk for those looking to expand their credit card usage.5. OpenSky Secured VisaApply for this card with a quick, four-step online application, accept the terms, make a deposit and you’ll be ready to go. You will have to pay a $35 annual fee, but there’s no minimum credit score to get approved for this card. As with First Progress Platinum Elite, deposits can be as low as $200 and on-time payments are reported to all three bureaus to help you build your credit.6. Capital One QuicksilverOneCapital One used to list the credit requirement for its QuicksilverOne card as “fair” and charged a $39 annual fee, but those days are over. The annual fee is now zero and so is intro APR: 0% for 15 months and then 17.99% – 27.99% variable APR past that timeframe. Other than that, it offers many of the same perks from Capital One, including unlimited 1.5% cash back with every purchase and up to a $200 cash bonus, as well as some Travel Rewards that come with no foreign transaction fees.Start Building Your CreditEven with poor credit or no credit, you can still get a credit card to build or rebuild credit. A credit card can make paying for things very convenient–but you must be responsible with it. Avoid getting into debt if you want to increase your credit score and open up other credit options in the future. There are no such things as guaranteed-approval credit cards, and if you apply for too many credit cards in a short period of time, it could hurt your credit.Easiest Types of Credit Cards To GetYou can also improve your credit score with a couple of these credit card options, provided you make timely payments.Store credit cards: Store cards might be the easiest credit cards to get with bad credit because they generally don’t require a high credit score. In addition, you can build your credit with a store card. You are, however, limited to using it at that particular store, typically a department store.Prepaid cards: A prepaid credit card works like a debit card. You make a deposit to the card and withdraw the funds as you make purchases. You won’t build your credit with a prepaid credit card because issuers typically don’t report your usage to the credit bureaus.Secured credit cards: Like prepaid credit cards, secured credit cards require a deposit. If you fail to make the payments, you’ll lose your deposit. Unlike prepaid cards, secured credit card issuers report your payment history to the credit bureaus so you can repair and build your credit with this type of card. Because credit cards for bad credit with no deposit can be hard to find, you might get a secured card as a good alternative.More From GOBankingRates9 Costco Brand Items That Aren't Worth the Money9 Safest Places To Retire Abroad for Less Than $2,000 a Month5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00010 Credit Score Myths You Should Stop BelievingJake Arky and Allen Young contributed to the reporting for this article.Methodology: GOBankingRates.com identified the best credit cards by analyzing purchase APRs, credit card fees, rewards and offers.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Union Pacific UNP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern NSC.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Biden Intervention Averts Rail StrikeOn Dec 2, President Joe Biden signed the resolution to avoid a rail strike, thereby bringing relief to the U.S. economy, which is already reeling under high inflation and supply chain issues. Unions and railroad companies like Union Pacific, CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern had time till Dec 9 to iron out differences and reach an agreement to avoid a strike. With the President signing the bill that would make a rail strike illegal, that damaging possibility has been put to rest.All the abovementioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We remind investors that stocks in the railroad space have been hitherto hit hard by headwinds like supply-chain woes, labor woes and high fuel costs. Due to supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity, overall volumes declined 2% year over year at Norfolk Southern in third-quarter 2022.While releasing the third-quarter 2022 results, management at Union Pacific trimmed its carload growth (volumes) outlook for the current year to around 3% from the 4-5% band expected earlier. The high inflation-induced rise in interest rates, which may lead to an economic slowdown, resulted in the outlook cut. Also, now UNP expects 2022 operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) to be around 60%. Earlier the expectation was for the ratio to be around 58%. Lower the ratio, the better. The unfavorable forecast can be attributed to economic uncertainty. Supply-chain woes and escalated expenses on fuel also resulted in the deterioration of the operating ratio at another railroad operator — CSX Corporation — in the September quarter.Story continuesIf thestrike had materialized, the supply-chain woes would have been further aggravated, in turn, dealing a huge blow to customers already suffering from sky-high inflation. A nationwide railroad strike would have hit the economy very hard. The work stoppage by railroad workers was estimated to have cost the already fragile economy more than $2 billion a day.No wonder, the President was a relieved man, before signing the bill he said, “The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what, without a doubt, would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar.”With the damaging strike being averted let’s have a look back and recapture the related events.A strike by U.S. railroad workers had been looming large ever since workers at the largest rail union in the United States voted against a provisional deal reached in September this year. The rejection was due to the absence of a clause pertaining to granting of paid sick leave to workers in the railroad industry. The deal, however, included 24% compounded wage hike over the 2020-2024 period and five annual lump sum payments amounting to $1,000, per a Reuters report.With the specter of a rail strike looming, that would cripple the economy, the President intervened to thwart that damaging possibility. Accordingly, the House voted 290 to 137 on Nov 30 for imposing the tentative deal reached in September. The same was passed by the Senate (80-15) a day later. Following approval by the House and the Senate, the President signed the legislation to block the rail strike. However, the Senate failed to approve a measure pertaining to paid sick leave.What’s Ahead?While it is clear that there will be no rail strike, the fact remains that the major area of dispute – regarding paid sick leaves, is still unresolved. However, on the contentious issue, the President has said ""That fight isn't over."" While unions demand the presence of paid sick leave, railroad companies like UNP, CSX and NSC are totally opposed to the inclusion of the clause as it would increase their labor costs, Given this backdrop. we expect investors to follow the updates on this burning issue in the coming days.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

According to Bankrate’s third-quarter survey, 65% of economists believe that the US economy could contract within the next 12 to 18 months. The estimates have grown significantly since the first quarter when 33% of the candidates surveyed expected a recession. This uncertain market situation has pushed investors toward high-yield dividend securities.High-yield dividend stocks have shown strong performance over other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. According to a report by Franklin Templeton Investments, an American multinational capital markets company, the ICE BofA US High Yield Index outperformed the broader market by 9 percentage points during and after the early 1990s and by 13 percentage points in the early 2000s. The report also mentioned that high-yield stocks remain resilient during periods of economic downturns, whereas earnings tend to decline during a recession. Another report by JPMorgan mentioned that earnings-per-share suffered a harsh decline during recessionary periods when dividends remained stable.According to analysts, dividend stocks with healthy yields can pull investors out of the gloomy market and provide profits on their investments. Dividend stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are grabbing attention this year because these companies have raised their payouts for decades and generated stable income for investors.However, we will discuss very high-yield dividend stocks in this article.Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below pay dividends to shareholders and have yields above 13%, as of December 5.

285,cd5e6eab-68c9-37d8-8bac-239ac7c29da7,KO,2022-12-07,3 Beverage Innovators to Caffeinate your Watchlist,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-beverage-innovators-caffeinate-watchlist-185906365.html,1670353146,STORY,"['MNST', 'CELH', 'COCO', 'KO']","[Do you know what the top-performing stock has been over the past 20 years? The probable answers to this question from most investors are probably along the lines of Apple (AAPL), Amazon AMZN, or Alphabet GOOGL. Though thosewould be good guesses, they would be incorrect. Monster Beverage Corporation MNST (formerly known as Hansen Natural, ticker symbol HANS) is the top performer by a long shot. Over the past 20 years, Monster has racked up more than 100,000% in gains, far outpacing any tech stock. To put Monster’s performance in perspective, the second-largest winner over that time is Tractor Supply Co. TSCO, which has scored gains of more than 40,000%. Below I will discuss where Monster is today, plus two other innovative beverage companies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPicutred: Monster Beverage's performance over the past 20 years versus the S&amp;P 500 Monster Beverage: Innovation Leads to SuccessHansen’s, later called Hansen Natural and ultimately Monster Beverage Corp was founded in 1935. For years Hansen existed as a relatively obscure beverage brand that sold juices and “healthy” sodas. That was until 2002, when Hansen decided to diverge from its core business and foray into the energy drink market. Hansen created the Monster Energy Drink, a high-octane carbonated energy drink packed with vitamins. In other words, the company devised a novel way to deliver caffeine, the world’s most popular “drug” to the masses. The rest is history. At this time, Monster accounts for a little less than half of the gargantuan $5.7 billion energy drink market in the U.S.Monster proves that well-executed innovation and risk-taking can lead to success and massive gains for investors. However, with success, management has yet to rest on its laurels and continues to introduce unique beverages. The Monster brand has more than 30 different drink offerings including energy teas, coffee mixtures, and muscle drinks. Monster’s success has not gone unnoticed. In 2015, the Coca-Cola Company KO, the king of the beverage market, shelled out more than $2 billion to take a 16% stake in the company. Currently, Coca-Cola is the largest shareholder in the firm and has a stake of just shy of 20%.Story continuesDoes Monster’s Stock Still Have Energy?As Monster has grown to be one of the prominent players in the beverage space, the pace of growth has slowed little, with the last eight quarterly reports showing double-digit revenue growth. Last quarter, Monster reported record net sales of $1.62 billion, rising 15% year over year. Despite the impressive sales growth, quarterly EPS fell 5% due to higher input costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and increased co-packaging costs. Nevertheless, management instilled confidence in the company’s prospects by announcing a new share repurchase program of $500 million.Bottom LineWhile Monster does not paint the perfect fundamental picture, there is much to be positive about over the next few years. First, the company has the backing of the most successful beverage company of all time, Coca-Cola. Second, management is buying back shares, a move that will create a floor for shares and increase confidence among investors. Lastly, inflation and the U.S. dollar continue to drop from lofty levels early this year – a tailwind for the company.Celsius Holdings: Flipping the Narrative on Energy DrinksLike Monster Beverage, Celsius Holdings Inc CELH has leveraged innovation to achieve massive success in the beverage space. Celsius has taken advantage of the prevailing narrative that most energy drinks are unhealthy and cause late-day crashes and jitters. Rather than create a caffeine-packed unhealthy energy drink, Celsius energy drinks contain no preservatives, high fructose corn syrup, or artificial ingredients. The bet has paid off.A Healthy Fundamental PictureBefore the last quarter, where the company achieved 98% revenue growth, Celsius had five straight quarters of triple-digit revenue growth. Though last quarter’s earnings saw negative impacts from a one-time sales and marketing termination expense of $155 million, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA vaulted to $24.8 million compared to the $10.3 million the company earned in the previous year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Zacks Mean Annual EPS estimates for CELHWhat does the future hold for Celsius?Celsius’s earnings history suggests that healthy energy drinks are here to stay. Zack’s Mean Consensus Estimates suggest that the company will continue to grow rapidly. GAAP estimates move back into positive territory in 2023 and Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate them to jump drastically in 2024. Like Monster Beverage, Celsius has a big backer in its corner, PepsiCo PEP. In August, Pepsi inked a $550 million deal that will give Pepsi an 8.5% in stake in the company, a seat on the board of directors, and a long-term distribution agreement. Pepsi’s agreement with Celsius provides investors with a vote of confidence and should help Celsius to continue to its meteoric growth phase and achieve further scale.Vita Coco: The Newcomer Vita Coco COCOis taking advantage of one of the hottest beverage trends over the past few years, coconut water. Vita Coco came public in October of 2021. Beyond the company’s top-selling coconut water, Vita Coco offers a clean energy drink, enhanced water products, and protein-infused water.FundamentalsThough Vita Coco is much smaller in market cap than Celsius, the company is growing at a slower pace. Last quarter sales increased a tepid 7% while gross profits decreased $11 million over the previous year to $81 million, driven by higher transportation costs. Recent Zack’s revenue estimates suggest that earnings growth will not turn around soon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Coco's uninspiring revenue revisionsTakeawayAt this point, Vita Coco is less attractive than its peers. Celsius and Monster boast more impressive fundamentals, higher liquidity, and the backing of industry leaders such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Nevertheless, investors should watch to see if Vita Coco’s brand can catch on in the next few years. If this is the case, we have learned from Monster and Celsius that it can lead to massive performance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more undervalued UK stocks, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued UK Stocks to Buy Now.The United Kingdom economy has been in turmoil as a result of the separation from the European Union, political instability, high inflation, and slow growth across the globe. Investors are thus hesitant to invest in companies based in the country. However, there are many undervalued stocks in the UK market that offer significant growth potential at bargain prices and have pricing power to weather the macro conditions. UK markets are expected to go through a significant multi-year fiscal tightening plan in the next few years. This tightening will amount to around £70 billion, 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), by 2025. These predictions have forced investment advisors like JP Morgan to revise their UK growth forecasts by assuming a further 0.2 percentage point drag in the fourth quarter of 2022, taking the hit from over the next year closer to 0.8%. One of the major market indicators in the UK is the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, a major stock market index which tracks the performance of 100 most capitalized companies traded on the London Stock Exchange. FTSE 100 companies represent about 80 percent of the entire market capitalization of the London Stock Exchange. It is a free-float index. The index recently hit a low of 7,500 points after a stronger-than-expected US jobs report dashed some hopes of a policy pivot in the UK. However, it recovered some ground amid a rebound in heavyweight value shares, mimicking the performance of US-based solid companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). In November 2022, the export-oriented index rallied almost 7%, the best monthly performance since November 2020, igniting hopes of a recovery. The yield on the UK’s 10-year government bond, also called gilt, fluttered around 3.1% at the start of December, remaining close to its lowest level since early September. Recently, the deputy governor of the Bank of England backed more interest rate hikes but clarified the government would consider cutting rates if the economy developed differently to expectations. Story continuesOther economic experts in the UK have also predicted that rates are likely to rise this year, be on hold the next year, and will then start falling in 2024. In order to sum up, the markets are betting on a 50 to 75 bps increase at the next December meeting of the central bank. Investors can take advantage of this temporary slowdown in the UK market to pick up shares of undervalued firms at discount prices. Since these firms have established businesses, their shares are most likely to rally in the coming months as the economy recovers. However, there is reason to proceed with caution in this regard. According to the central bank, although the economy might technically avoid a recession, it would still shrink by around 0.25% through 2023. The unemployment rate in the next few months is also likely to rise to around 5.5%. Per the central bank, households might see the biggest squeeze to their incomes since records started being kept in 1964. Energy prices are also set to rise further in Europe as the Russian invasion of Ukraine prolongs. As a result of higher inflation, the government in the UK is also under pressure to raise taxes on oil and gas firms, which have seen profits surge due to rising energy prices. These taxes are meant to fund measures aimed at helping families with low incomes during the coming economic crisis. Supply disruptions due to the virus crisis in China and the Ukraine war have also contributed to the rise in inflation over the past few months in the UK. Inflation is now at its highest levels in the country since 1982. However, there is reason to proceed with caution in this regard. According to the central bank, although the economy might technically avoid a recession, it would still shrink by around 0.25% through 2023. The unemployment rate in the next few months is also likely to rise to around 5.5%. Per the central bank, households might see the biggest squeeze to their incomes since records started being kept in 1964. Energy prices are also set to rise further in Europe as the Russian invasion of Ukraine prolongs. Our MethodologyThe firms based in the United Kingdom were selected for the list. The companies with a PE Ratio of around 20 or less were preferred. The analyst ratings of each company are also discussed to provide readers with some more context about their investment decisions. 10 Best Undervalued UK Stocks to Buy NowBest Undervalued UK Stocks to Buy Now10.

(NASDAQ:INTU) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We took advantage of its 2022 price decline to add a small position in Intuit. INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”7.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.44%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.11%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the industrial conglomerate had gained 1.44% over the past month. This has lagged the Conglomerates sector's gain of 5.34% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.22% in that time.General Electric will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect General Electric to post earnings of $1.12 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 21.74%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $21.88 billion, up 7.79% from the year-ago period.GE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.54 per share and revenue of $75.86 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +19.81% and +2.33%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. General Electric is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Looking at its valuation, General Electric is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 33.36. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.47, so we one might conclude that General Electric is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that GE currently has a PEG ratio of 4.77. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. GE's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.84 as of yesterday's close.The Diversified Operations industry is part of the Conglomerates sector.

That is none other than General Electric. Let's chat with the analysts making the call on GE, Oppenheimer's Managing Director and Senior Analyst Chris Glynn. Chris, good to see you here this morning. State your case.CHRISTOPHER GLYNN: Hey. So GE basically imploded on a number of dimensions in 2017 and 2018. They've made gradual progress on several fronts since then. The stock's been volatile in the meantime.And we think they're at a kind of critical juncture here, where some value drivers are being revealed through the spinoff process of health care, GE HealthCare will trade independently in the first week of June. They're getting a nice cash contribution from that. The balance sheet is fixed. And some of the longer projects for some of the more stubborn operational fixes are just getting past some of the peak pressures, renewables in particular.But aviation is performing very well, I would say better than peers, in an environment where the sector is plagued by various supply chain constraints. The power business, which had a central role towards the end of Jeff Immelt's career as CEO, when the stock collapsed, has been a steady, gradual improvement story. And there's room to go there. And they're going to be coming into some legitimate flexibility with their cash balances and capital allocation into 2023 in a way that has not been there for them for the past five years plus.- Hey, Chris. It's Julie here. So the stock is down about 9% year-to-date. So it's done better than the market, but it's still not done great right on an absolute basis. Do you think when the spin is actually effective in early January that that's going to unlock that potential that we could see in the stock? Are we going to see a big surge at that point in time?Story continuesCHRISTOPHER GLYNN: No, it comes down to the fundamentals. I think this call is not related to the timing of the GE HealthCare spinoff specifically. I would say the way that it has been arranged and the financing that has been established for GE HealthCare and the favorable impact on GE's net debt and net cash balances is a derivative with respect of the spin-off.But really, I think the stock's down year-to-date. And that helps create a backdrop to upgrade it. The reason the stock had been pressured earlier in the year is the renewables business really had a tough year with the real drop in US demand. We're in an interim period between tax credits, which are coming back on. Inflation hurt them pretty severely in that segment.And the complexity of the business, they have far too many variations of tower variety. And that becomes very difficult to service. They took a very large warranty charge in the third quarter.So this is sort of the last big fix area for GE. And it's really a classic best fit situation for the turning an ocean liner analogy. So we think the different pieces are coming up together right now, where you can formulate a price target that has some firm footing and some appeal.- Now, what about turning an aircraft? Because a lot of the thesis here is really based around GE Aviation as well. And so are they able to move through any materials issues that we've seen persist at some point in 2022 and even further out now to hit some of the targets that you've set forth for the aviation side of the business?CHRISTOPHER GLYNN: Yeah, I think that you are referring to the broader industry supply chain issues, which are legion-- this part, that part from this country or that country or this small supplier or that big supplier causing units up and down the supply chain to go backwards and forwards on lines. GE's actually done a relatively good job on that. They're growing over 20% top line this year. And they're delivering mid 30% incremental margins, operating leverage.So you might even look at their reported numbers this year and say, what supply chain issues? Their military revenue has been gated. And they have a good program ledger and expected solid compound growth the next several years. That's been pushed out a little bit. But the commercial aftermarket has been very strong. And OEM has been a little bit lumpy, commercial OEM. But it's been good.You're going to have a mixed headwind next year. So we have flattish margins we're modeling next year. But it should be very strong double digits top line again. And so that'll drive good profit growth for the aviation segment in '23.- Really solid analysis. Oppenheimer's Managing Director and Senior Analyst Christopher Glynn. Chris, thanks so much for the time.]"

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Procter &amp; Gamble could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble peKeen to find out how analysts think Procter &amp; Gamble's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Procter &amp; Gamble's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Procter &amp; Gamble's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 5.3%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 275% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 4.4% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.0% per year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's alarming that Procter &amp; Gamble's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Procter &amp; Gamble currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Procter &amp; Gamble   you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

You can skip our detailed analysis of high-dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Very High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The soaring inflation and consistent interest rates hike have analysts worried about a full-blown recession in the next few months. According to Bankrate’s third-quarter survey, 65% of economists believe that the US economy could contract within the next 12 to 18 months. The estimates have grown significantly since the first quarter when 33% of the candidates surveyed expected a recession. This uncertain market situation has pushed investors toward high-yield dividend securities.High-yield dividend stocks have shown strong performance over other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. According to a report by Franklin Templeton Investments, an American multinational capital markets company, the ICE BofA US High Yield Index outperformed the broader market by 9 percentage points during and after the early 1990s and by 13 percentage points in the early 2000s. The report also mentioned that high-yield stocks remain resilient during periods of economic downturns, whereas earnings tend to decline during a recession. Another report by JPMorgan mentioned that earnings-per-share suffered a harsh decline during recessionary periods when dividends remained stable.According to analysts, dividend stocks with healthy yields can pull investors out of the gloomy market and provide profits on their investments. Dividend stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are grabbing attention this year because these companies have raised their payouts for decades and generated stable income for investors.However, we will discuss very high-yield dividend stocks in this article.Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below pay dividends to shareholders and have yields above 13%, as of December 5.

301,89a759a3-becc-3aa8-8c98-fe506d32127b,PG,2022-12-07,Is It Worth Investing in P&G (PG) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-p-g-pg-164004013.html,1670344804,STORY,['PG'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.Check price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying P&amp;G, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PG a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.83.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more undervalued UK stocks, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued UK Stocks to Buy Now.The United Kingdom economy has been in turmoil as a result of the separation from the European Union, political instability, high inflation, and slow growth across the globe. Investors are thus hesitant to invest in companies based in the country. However, there are many undervalued stocks in the UK market that offer significant growth potential at bargain prices and have pricing power to weather the macro conditions. UK markets are expected to go through a significant multi-year fiscal tightening plan in the next few years. This tightening will amount to around £70 billion, 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), by 2025. These predictions have forced investment advisors like JP Morgan to revise their UK growth forecasts by assuming a further 0.2 percentage point drag in the fourth quarter of 2022, taking the hit from over the next year closer to 0.8%. One of the major market indicators in the UK is the performance of the FTSE 100 Index, a major stock market index which tracks the performance of 100 most capitalized companies traded on the London Stock Exchange. FTSE 100 companies represent about 80 percent of the entire market capitalization of the London Stock Exchange. It is a free-float index. The index recently hit a low of 7,500 points after a stronger-than-expected US jobs report dashed some hopes of a policy pivot in the UK. However, it recovered some ground amid a rebound in heavyweight value shares, mimicking the performance of US-based solid companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). In November 2022, the export-oriented index rallied almost 7%, the best monthly performance since November 2020, igniting hopes of a recovery. The yield on the UK’s 10-year government bond, also called gilt, fluttered around 3.1% at the start of December, remaining close to its lowest level since early September. Recently, the deputy governor of the Bank of England backed more interest rate hikes but clarified the government would consider cutting rates if the economy developed differently to expectations. Story continuesOther economic experts in the UK have also predicted that rates are likely to rise this year, be on hold the next year, and will then start falling in 2024. In order to sum up, the markets are betting on a 50 to 75 bps increase at the next December meeting of the central bank. Investors can take advantage of this temporary slowdown in the UK market to pick up shares of undervalued firms at discount prices. Since these firms have established businesses, their shares are most likely to rally in the coming months as the economy recovers. However, there is reason to proceed with caution in this regard. According to the central bank, although the economy might technically avoid a recession, it would still shrink by around 0.25% through 2023. The unemployment rate in the next few months is also likely to rise to around 5.5%. Per the central bank, households might see the biggest squeeze to their incomes since records started being kept in 1964. Energy prices are also set to rise further in Europe as the Russian invasion of Ukraine prolongs. As a result of higher inflation, the government in the UK is also under pressure to raise taxes on oil and gas firms, which have seen profits surge due to rising energy prices. These taxes are meant to fund measures aimed at helping families with low incomes during the coming economic crisis. Supply disruptions due to the virus crisis in China and the Ukraine war have also contributed to the rise in inflation over the past few months in the UK. Inflation is now at its highest levels in the country since 1982. However, there is reason to proceed with caution in this regard. According to the central bank, although the economy might technically avoid a recession, it would still shrink by around 0.25% through 2023. The unemployment rate in the next few months is also likely to rise to around 5.5%. Per the central bank, households might see the biggest squeeze to their incomes since records started being kept in 1964. Energy prices are also set to rise further in Europe as the Russian invasion of Ukraine prolongs. Our MethodologyThe firms based in the United Kingdom were selected for the list.

The tenants will be able to relax or gather in small groups throughout the workday in this private club-style space, having a hotel lobby-style design.One Madison Avenue will also feature an 11,000 square feet rooftop deck as part of the building’s amenity program, providing a one-of-a-kind opportunity to create a seamless indoor/outdoor, work/entertainment space. This deck will have a 5,400 square feet interior event space and a 5,800 square feet lavishly landscaped patio overlooking Madison Square Park. Chef Boulud will take care of the entire catering capability.Per Steven Durels, executive vice president and director of leasing and real property of SLG, “One Madison Avenue builds on the success of One Vanderbilt Avenue, taking the workplace experience to a new level with unique offerings specific to its Flatiron location.”Earlier, in 2021, SLG executed a 20-year lease with Chelsea Piers Fitness for 55,780 square feet at One Madison Avenue, covering portions of the ground, second and lower two levels of the building. One Madison Avenue will be the premier wellness brand’s fourth location and second in Manhattan.SL Green, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, has lost 17% in the past three months compared with its industry’s decline of 10%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Chatham Lodging Trust REIT CLDT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221206005015/en/Third wave of insights for 2022 (Graphic: Business Wire)Despite this dip in economic confidence, the study found more businesses are currently growing compared to this time last year (61% vs. 51%). More than half (53%) of small businesses1 also reported growth, the highest in 2022 and up from 46% in July. More than 70% of large businesses2 reported growth in the most recent October survey.Businesses focus on maintaining benefits and wagesHowever, businesses and employees remain uneasy about economic pressures. Seventy percent of employers and 74% of employees believe it’s somewhat or very likely a recession will happen in the next six months; this is up from 65% of employers in July.To address a potential downturn, businesses are choosing to reduce operational expenses or raise prices on goods and services over reducing employee salaries and benefits. Sixty four percent of small businesses said they will not reduce salaries compared to 49% of large businesses. Similarly, 57% of small businesses said they will not reduce benefits to adapt for a recession compared to 45% of large operations. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of employees surveyed reported wage increases within the past year.""If there’s one constant in our research of the small and midsize business community, it’s that they remain committed to their employees. Earlier this year, businesses said they weren’t going to impact benefits or wages, and that sentiment is holding,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of U.S. Insurance Solutions at Principal®. ""While the economic outlook is murky, business owners understand employees are their most valuable asset and they’re continuing to support them with retirement and protection solutions, as well as financial wellness programs.""Story continuesEmployee uptake of financial wellness programs increased 70% in the past six months, and 79% said these programs better prepare for retirement.Employees prepare for potential recessionAbout half of employees surveyed indicated they are already reducing discretionary spending to prepare for a potential recession. However, ""decreasing savings for retirement"" is the least likely action employees would take amidst a recession.""Financial wellness tools clearly matter to employees, but building a program is just the start to help employees,"" said Heather Winston, director of financial planning and advice with Retirement &amp; Income Solutions at Principal. ""Employers can help to further support them by communicating the availability of those benefits and encouraging usage.""Recession concerns are having a significant impact on employee mental health, especially among younger generations. More than two-thirds (67%) of employees agree that concerns about a recession have impacted their stress levels or mental health, with Millennials (79%) and Gen Z (76%) more likely to report impacts.""When examining the list of concerns, a disconnect persists between employers and employees,"" said Friedrich. ""While employers are more concerned about economic impacts, employees’ concerns focus on personal health and wellbeing. Employers have an opportunity to focus on understanding and meeting employees’ needs and addressing them for continued long-term job satisfaction and growth.""See all results and insights from the latest Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM (PDF).__________________________1 Businesses with two to 499 employees.2 Businesses with 500 – 10,000 employees.About the Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSMThe Principal Financial Well-Being IndexSM surveys business owners, decision makers and business leaders aged 21 and over who work at companies with 2 – 10,000 employees.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So on that note, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Sherwin-Williams is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$2.8b ÷ (US$22b - US$6.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 12% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams roceIn the above chart we have measured Sherwin-Williams' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsSherwin-Williams is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 62% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, we're delighted to see that Sherwin-Williams has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And with a respectable 95% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams   you'll probably want to know about.While Sherwin-Williams may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

(FCX) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-freeportmcmoran-inc-fcx-140002765.html,1670335202,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this mining company have returned +12.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has gained 11.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.35 per share, indicating a change of -63.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.29 points to a change of -26.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.65 indicates a change of -28.2% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.2%. The $22.4 billion and $22.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.9% and +0.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.8%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.89 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.75%. The EPS surprise was -23.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

FCX, Southern Copper Corp. SCCO and First Quantum Minerals FQVLF.Industry: Non-Ferrous MetalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2025172/3-non-ferrous-metal-mining-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe prospects of the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry look bleak as apprehensions about slowing demand and economic activity have been weighing down commodity prices. Additionally, the industry players are grappling with inflated input costs, particularly energy as well as labor shortages and supply-chain issues.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and First Quantum Minerals. These are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process.Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly precede actual mining. The miners continually search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Fears of an Economic Slowdown Weighing on Commodity Prices: Copper prices have declined for most part of this year due to varied reasons — the uncertainties surrounding the global economy, resurgent COVID outbreaks in top consumer China, the Russia-Ukraine situation, spike in energy costs and low global inventories. Zinc and nickel prices were also weighed down by worries about weak demand as COVID-19 lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession.Story continuesSilver prices have also been negatively impacted this year, thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth. Gold prices also felt the pressure of a rallying dollar and Treasury yields. However, recently, metal prices have found support amid expectations of a pickup in industrial demand as Fed Chair Powell signaled that the central bank may slow the pace of rate hikes this month. Concerns of low supply are also aiding prices.Cost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues.Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. The industry participants are opting for alternative energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies.Impending Demand and Supply Imbalance: The industry players are currently dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future given their wide usage in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials.Demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy are expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals. While demand remains strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, would favor the industry in the long haul.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #204, which places it in the bottom 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of this year, the industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 38%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 7.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Basic Materials sector growth of 1.8%. The S&amp;P 500 has dipped 12.8% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Mining- Non Ferrous stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 4.95X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.03X. The Basic Materials sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is at 6.32X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 8.88X and as low as 3.42X, with the median being at 6.03X.3 Mining-Non Ferrous Stocks to Keep an Eye onFreeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in an incremental annual production of around 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum.Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves.  It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci also increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually.The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. Focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable. Shares of FCX have gained 7.6% over the past year.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 indicates year-over-year growth of 0.6%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Southern Copper: The company has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates world-class assets in investment-grade countries, such as Mexico and Peru. Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable.SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 926,000 tons, with the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. It will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves.Peru’s national output is anticipated grow to 206,999 by next year. Southern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion.

The company, which owns brands including Lay’s, Tropicana, and Quaker Oats, in addition to its namesake cola business, employs more than 300,000 workers.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe cuts come after Pepsi raised its revenue forecast for the year, which seemed to signal that higher prices—due to inflation—had not stopped people from consuming its products. In its recent earnings report though, the company announced a decline in its operating margin. Pepsi also reported a drop in market share for its carbonated soft drinks.Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s CFO, said on a conference call with investors and analysts in October that if margin goals aren’t met, the company will continue to cut costs, “so that if the revenue growth does start to soften up a little bit, we’ll still be in a position to deliver superior financial results.”Where are the layoffs happening?The tech layoffs have dominated headlines, in part because many of these companies had gone on hiring sprees during the pandemic. In November, tech giants Meta and Amazon announced they would lay off tens of thousands of workers each.Reasons for the tech layoffs vary. Meta, which laid off 13% of its workforce, blamed the waning e-commerce boom, the projected revenue hit from the economic downturn, increased competition, and decreasing advertising. DoorDash, which benefited from pandemic-related lockdowns, recently laid off about 7% of its workforce because growth, it said, had tapered.But as the Pepsi news highlights, these problems are affecting all kinds of industries, including packaged food, retail, and media. Other food businesses including Beyond Meat, Impossible Burger, and Coca-Cola, have also trimmed their workforces. BuzzFeed, an online publication, today announced it would cut 12% of its workforce, blaming in part macroeconomic conditions. And in August, the WSJ reported that Walmart would lay off hundreds of workers. The retail giant said higher prices were pushing consumers to spend less.Story continuesDespite the layoffs, the US continues to add jobs, particularly in leisure and hospitality, healthcare, and government.

But its projections about the path of future rate hikes are likely to dominate investor attention.Recent economic data including an upside surprise in services activity and a strong monthly jobs report have stoked investor fears that Fed’s higher for longer rate regime may tip the economy into recession.“The bottom line is that this [wage-driven inflation] isn’t an easy fix,” Eric Diton, President and Managing Director at The Wealth Alliance told Investing.com’s Yasin Ebrahim in a recent interview. ""The only way the Fed's really going to get this pressure on wages down is to cause a recession, which they probably will.""Energy stocks were dragged lower by falling oil prices amid jitters about slowing global growth and worries about the oil demand outlook even as China, the world’s top energy importer, recently eased economically draining COVID restrictions.APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), and EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG) led the losses, with the latter closing nearly 5% lower.PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) lost about 1% as media reports the firm is readying hundreds of job cuts at its North American snacks and beverages divisions sparked jitters about slowing growth.Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI), the heavily exposed lender to cryptocurrency firms, continued to rack up losses falling more than 4% even as chief executive officer Alan Lane said the bank had ample liquidity to meet customer withdrawals following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.Story continuesIn other news, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) is set to roll out its last 747 jet, marking the end of the aircraft’s 50-year iconic reign as the company moves to produce more efficient jets.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow ends in red as Fed fears wound techTSMC expects $10 billion in annual revenue from Arizona fabsBlackRock has frozen hires, reduced spending, says CFO]"
320,ccf667b6-9eb0-307c-bf89-246cf694af45,DGX,2022-12-07,"Quest Diagnostics (DGX) Volume Growth Aids, Margin Woes Stay",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-volume-growth-175305430.html,1670349185,STORY,"['DGX', 'MEDP', 'MMSI', 'AMN']","[Quest Diagnostics DGX has been focusing on areas with high potential as part of its two-point strategy. Positive demography and cost reduction initiatives are the other upsides. Over the past several quarters, soft industry trends, resulting in a low-volume environment, have acted as a dampener for Quest Diagnostics. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, Quest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 0.6% compared with 34.7% decline of the industry.Quest Diagnostics reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 earnings and revenues. The base business grew 5% despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. The company’s performance rebounded in August and September from a softer volume trend that it witnessed earlier in the year. Before Hurricane Ian hit in September, Quest Diagnostics witnessed some of its historically highest base testing volumes.The company’s legacy base business grew 5.1% in the third quarter amid softer utilization trends, which impacted the entire healthcare industry. During the reported quarter, base business revenue per requisition was up 3.3%. The more favorable pricing environment remained consistent with the company’s expectations, with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter.In addition, Quest Diagnostics continued to invest in advanced diagnostics and consumer-initiated testing. To help offset inflationary pressure, it continues to pursue its operational excellence strategy and has been closely managing the cost structure through the company’s invigorate initiatives.With a bullish expectation for the remainder of 2022, the company raised its full-year guidance.In terms of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), the company is optimistic about the recently introduced federal laboratory legislation called the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act (SALSA). The company believes that SALSA has the potential to fix PAMA permanently. It would set the Medicare Clinical Lab Fee Schedule back on a sustainable path. If SALSA is not passed, it will result in Medicare cuts over three years, with additional cuts thereafter.Story continuesOn the flip side, in the third quarter of 2022, Quest Diagnostics’ revenues and adjusted earnings fell year over year on a significant drop in COVID-19 testing demand. Testing revenues were $316 million in the third quarter, down 55% from 2021 and 11% from the sequentially-last quarter.The company noted that after plateauing in June and July, COVID-19 molecular testing volumes steadily declined. Quest Diagnostics expects COVID-19 molecular volumes to average down to 10,000 to 15,000 per day in the fourth quarter.Diagnostic Information Services revenues declined 10.5% year over year, reflecting lower COVID-19 testing services sales in the reported quarter. The year-over-year contraction in margins is also worrying. The gross margin was 34.9%, reflecting a 488-basis point (bp) contraction from the year-ago figure. Adjusted operating margin of 16.3% represented an 815-bp contraction year over year.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.  W.W. Grainger, Ameriprise Financial, Grand Canyon Education and Texas Roadhouse are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsBoth a strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 5% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that both growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Story continuesUsing the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four of the five stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

The findings are based on survey responses from over 4,700 participants across 26 countries.Resilience has emerged as a top priority as a staggering 62 percent of organizations surveyed said they had experienced a security event that impacted business in the past two years. The leading types of incidents were network or data breaches (51.5 percent), network or system outages (51.1 percent), ransomware events (46.7 percent) and distributed denial of service attacks (46.4 percent).These incidents resulted in severe repercussions for the companies that experienced them, along with the ecosystem of organizations they do business with. The leading impacts cited include IT and communications interruption (62.6 percent), supply chain disruption (43 percent), impaired internal operations (41.4 percent) and lasting brand damage (39.7 percent).With stakes this high, it is no surprise that 96 percent of executives surveyed for the report said that security resilience is high priority for them. The findings further highlight that the main objectives of security resilience for security leaders and their teams are to prevent incidents, and mitigate losses when they occur.Story continues""Technology is transforming businesses at a scale and speed never seen before. While this is creating new opportunities, it also brings with it challenges, especially on the security front. To be able to tackle these effectively, companies need the ability to anticipate, identify, and withstand cyber threats, and if breached be able to rapidly recover from one. That is what building resilience is all about,"" said Helen Patton, CISO, Cisco Security Business Group.""Security, after all, is a risk business. As companies don't secure everything, everywhere, security resilience allows them to focus their security resources on the pieces of the business that add the most value to an organization, and ensure that value is protected,"" she added.Seven Success Factors of Security ResilienceThis year's report has developed a methodology to generate a security resilience score for the organizations surveyed, and identified seven data-backed success factors. Organizations that had these factors present were among the top 90th percentile of resilient businesses. Conversely, those lacking them placed in the bottom 10th percentile of performers.The findings of the study underline the fact that security is a human endeavor as leadership, company culture and resourcing have an oversized impact on resilience:Organizations that report poor security support from the C-suite scored 39 percent lower than those with strong executive support.Businesses that report an excellent security culture scored 46 percent higher on average than those without.Companies that maintain extra internal staffing and resources to respond to incidents resulted in a 15 percent boost in resilient outcomes.In addition, businesses need to take care to reduce complexity when transitioning from on-premise to fully cloud-based environments:Companies whose technology infrastructures are either mostly on-premise or mostly cloud-based had the highest, and nearly identical, security resilience scores. However, businesses that are in the initial stages of transitioning from an on-premise to a hybrid cloud environment saw scores drop between 8.5 and 14 percent depending on how difficult the hybrid environments were to manage.Finally, adopting and maturing advanced security solutions has significant impacts to resilient outcomes:Companies that reported implementing a mature Zero Trust model saw a 30 percent increase in resilience score compared to those that had none.Advanced extended detection and response capabilities correlated to an incredible 45 percent increase for organizations over those that report having no detection and response solutions.Converging networking and security into a mature, cloud-delivered secure access services edge boosted security resilience scores by 27 percent.""The Security Outcomes Reports are a study into what works and what doesn't in cybersecurity. The ultimate goal is to cut through the noise in the market by identifying practices that lead to more secure outcomes for defenders,"" said Jeetu Patel, executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration at Cisco. ""This year we focused on identifying the key factors that elevate the security resilience of a business to among the very best in the industry.""Additional Resources:Report: Security Outcomes Report, Volume 3: Achieving Security ResilienceBlog: Cracking the Code to Security Resilience: Lessons from the Latest Cisco Security Outcomes ReportAbout Cisco Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet.

Although I was a young teenager at the time, I still remember how inspired I was by her courage and passion for fairness. The inspiration lingered and, as odd as it sounds, gave me the idea to pursue human resources as I researched where to go to college and ultimately my chosen profession.In 2022, there is still opportunity for greater fairness in all workplaces, and I am honored to be part of Cisco's effort to ensure fairness for our employees. As the head of compensation at Cisco, I am dedicated to pursuing fairness in pay for our employees globally.Our Journey to Address Pay FairnessAt Cisco, we started our formal pay fairness journey in 2016. Our first steps recognized that ensuring pay is fair isn't a once-and-done task to complete. Because workforces are dynamic-employees grow in their careers, people move in and out of jobs, new positions are created, groups are reorganized-the work of evaluating pay fairness is never done. Instead, it's an ongoing process, and our job has been and will continue to be to create a robust system that continually evaluates and pursues fairness across the full spectrum of diversity.When we announced our Social Justice Beliefs and 12 Actions in 2020, we committed to aggressively expand our approach to fair pay for all employees through Social Justice Action 3, Expand Pay Parity.In addition to base salary, we now review promotions, stock grant values, and bonuses annually. We analyze data to see if there are differences between gender, race, and ethnicity. We look at equivalent or similar jobs, job grade levels, location, and other factors that impact pay.In 2020 and 2021, we made fairness adjustments for both bonuses and stock grant values. For 2022, we included fairness reviews for promotion participation and stock grant participation.Story continues""Ensuring pay is fair isn't a once-and-done task to complete. It's an ongoing process, and our job has been to create a robust system that continually pursues fairness.""We are proud of the progress we have made. Our analysis shows the processes we have put in place have yielded an overall equitable compensation system. Within the pay elements we analyze, a small percentage of employees-typically 1-2%-receive adjustments for fairness. This is exactly the result we would expect in our dynamic and constantly changing organization: we won't have perpetual perfection, but with our systemic equality only minor modifications are needed at any given point.What Our Employees Tell UsIn response to our efforts, we hear from our employees and leaders that they appreciate our actions and knowing they work for a company that is committed to fair pay. They tell us that it drives greater job satisfaction and helps to retain top talent.At the end of the day, knowing our employees and leaders are proud of the work we're doing validates our mission and fuels us to continue to expand and continue to raise the bar on our commitments.The Future of Pay FairnessAs we look ahead, we believe there will be increased attention on pay fairness and how it is measured in the US and around the globe. Current governmental metrics and requirements are focused on increasing transparency and reporting, a critical step in advancing accountability and leveling the playing field, but they don't tell the whole story. Simplistic measures that are commonly used such as ""82 cents on the dollar,"" often cited for gender pay equity, can actually reduce accountability when used as a standalone metric.At Cisco, we are focused on improving our processes to ensure pay fairness, such as increasing full-spectrum representation in all types of jobs at all levels of the organization. We can't pay people fairly if we don't have them on our team. And once we hire them, we're committed to their growth and development-and their fair pay. This is the power of our social justice action plan; it brings together our entire ecosystem to ensure pay fairness is embedded and connected throughout our organization.An Ongoing CommitmentIt's been more than 40 years since I watched Norma Rae fight for workers on the big screen. While it can be frustrating that we're still on this journey, my resolve, passion, and optimism has only strengthened. I am proud of the great progress Cisco has made over the last several years, and I'm excited about the progress we will make in the years ahead.Learn more about our commitment to powering an inclusive future for all and how we're driving social justice through change.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730411/How-Cisco-Is-Pursuing-Pay-Fairness]"
