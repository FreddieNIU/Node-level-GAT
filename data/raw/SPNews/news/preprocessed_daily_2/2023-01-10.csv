Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.

The strong trend is likely to continue given the historical trend of “January Effect.” While large caps tend to perform better, small-cap securities have historically proven their outperformance in January.For investors seeking to capitalize on this opportunity, small-cap ETFs like the following could be solid pure plays. All these have a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).What is January Effect?January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices due largely to year-end tax considerations. Investors redeploy their capital to speculate on weaker performers in January after selling winners in December to create tax losses. This phenomenon pushes the stock market higher in the first month of the year.According to some market experts, the January Effect actually runs from mid-December through February, with small caps continuing to outperform their large-cap cousins.January Effect Seems RealInflation is easing and consumer confidence is rising, reflecting that the stock market will likely move higher. The consumer price index jumped 7.1% year over year in November, down from a 7.7% year-over-year increase in October and a recent peak of 9.1% in June. This represents the lowest annual increase since late 2021 (read: 5 Top-Ranked ETFs to Buy at Bargain Prices for 2023).Story continuesAmericans have regained confidence in the U.S. economy, with consumer confidence bouncing back in December and reversing consecutive declines in October and November to reach its highest level since April, per the University of Michigan's Consumer Confidence Index. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index also climbed to 108.3 from 101.4 in November.The latest job report has added to the strength. The U.S. added 223,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, matching a 50-decade low. However, wage growth lost momentum, which gave investors hope that the Fed can ease off on its interest-rate increases.

If you want to see more of the best growth stocks, go directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In a report titled “2023 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions” JPMorgan mentioned some reasons why now could be the right time to pile into growth stocks, citing lower valuations. Here are some of the important comments of JPMorgan relevant to our article:""Lower valuations and higher yields mean that asset markets today offer the best long-term returns in more than a decade. It took a painful slump in stock and bond markets to get here, the worst of which may not yet be over. Still, the turmoil of 2022 might be considered a cathartic moment, revitalizing the portfolio toolkit and creating attractive investment opportunities in the years ahead.""Growth stocks could be the solid investment options for beginner investors as JPMorgan believes that the current market pressures would eventually recede. That means growth stocks could rebound strongly.“We expect today’s inflationary surge to eventually subside to a rate only slightly above our previous estimates. Our forecast annual return for a USD 60/40 stock-bond portfolio over the next 10–15 years leaps from 4.30% last year to 7.20%. Over the last 25 years, the rolling 10-year return for this portfolio has averaged 6.10%.""The report also said:“Opportunities for long-term investors with capital to deploy are the best we’ve seen since 2010. Meanwhile, we would remind those shouldering losses from the last year that investors able to avoid selling during drops tend to be rewarded in the longer run, and that the sharpest gains are often banked early in the cycle as markets first turn.”Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, used the growth ETF SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) and ranked the stock holdings of the ETF based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies as of the end of the third quarter.

We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”12. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Thermo has had strong earnings growth for many years and is led by a superb team. The company’s recent acquisitions make it a full-service supplier to the biopharma and biotech industries.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a software company that works in the publishing, advertising, digital media, and digital experience sectors.

Fisher Asset Management is the leading shareholder of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), with a stake worth over $1.42 billion.Here is what Jackson Square Partners said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two significant actions taken in the quarter were the exit of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and the initiation of Boeing. Adobe paid a price to acquire a competitor called Figma ($22B) that we could not justify even under the most bullish fundamental outlook. It struck us as desperate, defensive, and reactive. After reassuring investors for many quarters that Figma was not having a negative competitive impact on its business, to us this was a clear admission of the opposite. While a more optimistic interpretation could be that Figma is a good asset, Adobe just got rid of a competitor, and the day 1 stock reaction already wiped out more than $22B from Adobe’s market cap – we saw too many red flags potentially signaling worsening trends to come in Adobe’s core. It is also not obvious to us why Figma sails through anti-trust clearance, which if the deal is not allowed to proceed would leave a gaping exposure as Adobe just showed its hand.”10. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) creates and distributes interactive entertainment content and services. The forward P/E ratio for Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Inc. is 24.94x.

When it became clear management had misled the market on the extent of the problem we sold, led by our principles of Responsible Investing. We did not benefit from the subsequent M&amp;A premium paid by Microsoft.”9. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100T-Mobile US, Inc.

While it reported modestly down earnings in 2008, its earnings rebounded quickly to record highs in 2010 and the shares responded strongly in anticipation of this.”6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 140Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) produces and sells wearables, accessories, computers, tablets, and smartphones. Apple is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio 20.23x. This is a premium above the sector-average forward P/E of 7.99x. Apple Inc.

The company reported better than expected revenues, though that came from a lower-than-expected supply chain impact. Apple called out pockets of weakness in wearables as well as home &amp; accessories. Management referenced macroeconomic uncertainty and sounded somewhat guarded when commenting on fourth quarter expectations. In September, Apple introduced four new iPhones with retail prices kept at last year’s levels. Its shares edged forward by 1% in consideration of these developments. We trimmed the position after evaluating the channel which highlighted some consumer demand choppiness.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:15 Best Sin Stocks To Buy11 Best Stocks To Buy for Deflation10 Cheap Solar Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In the Southern California Inland Empire region, where the poverty rate is higher than most of the country and only about 15% of high school graduates eventually earn a bachelor's degree, the industry can provide an attractive alternative to college.That's in part why a project by the Inland Empire (IE) office of GRID Alternatives - the nation's largest nonprofit solar installer - to build a new Clean Tech Training Center (CTTC) is particularly exciting. The facility, which launched earlier this month and has its first intake of students in early 2023, will make solar installation jobs more accessible to many in the region.""Currently, GRID Alternatives Inland Empire is the only solar installation educator in the Inland Empire providing hands-on experience at no-cost to job trainees,"" said Nika Hogue, development officer of GRID IE. ""Considering that the need for alternative educational pathways in the Inland Empire is vital, GRID is proactively responding by building the CTTC for workforce development, providing pathways to bright careers for the local workforce and meeting green energy employer needs.""The CTTC, which is being built with the assistance of a $50,000 U.S. Bank Market Impact Fund grant, will be unique in that the facility will have mock roofs that allow trainees to get hands-on experience without having to be in the field. This will be especially beneficial for high school youths who are unable to get roof access because of age restrictions. A separate $10,000 U.S. Bank Community Possible Grant to GRID IE will help fund the inaugural cohort of 40 Solar Futures students at the facility, with programming for 300 students planned for 2023.Story continuesHowever, the new CTTC with mock roofs won't just benefit high school students. The centrally located facility will also increase training access to people on a spectrum of physical ability and for transitionally housed individuals who might not have ready access to transportation.""The biggest new opportunity that the new Clean Tech Training Center buildout will offer us is it will create a dedicated space independent of our construction operations out in the field where we can provide centralized access to job training in a very controlled environment,"" said Jaime Alonso, executive director of GRID Alternatives IE.The new facility will allow capacity to meet people where they're at, train more individuals, and collaborate with more nonprofit partners working with specific populations such as the justice involved community. Whether it's training for, or training on, this facility will help increase the number of solar installations for the low-income households that GRID IE serves. The homeowners, who qualify as low-income, receive the solar systems at no-cost, with no taxes or fees and benefit from 100% of the energy provided by the solar installations - saving families up to 75% annually on their utility bills.GRID was founded in 2001 in the wake of the California energy crisis, and U.S. Bank has been a partner since 2010 providing roughly $900,000 in financial support. That includes $155,000 in grants specifically to GRID IE since 2015.""We are excited about this project and our continued partnership with GRID,"" said Reba Dominski, chief social responsibility officer for U.S. Bank. ""This new facility will provide hands-on job training to create career opportunities in a growing and competitive field, and will provide solar energy to help homeowners in low to moderate income communities cover their monthly energy bills.""The Inland Empire office of GRID Alternatives opened in 2011 and has since helped train roughly 4,000 people. Many of those people have gone on to work for commercial companies that are happy to have a pipeline of new talent. Demand for trained solar installers is expected to remain strong, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting that demand for the jobs will grow 27% by 2031.""This really does give people a path to a decent paying job with a level of skill that is transferable between different companies. It uplifts the entire local community and the communities we serve, which are vibrant and diverse - but face challenges of low-income and inequitable access to high-paying jobs,"" said Richard Lintin, communications and marketing director of GRID Inland Empire.Tribal ProgramGRID works locally through eight affiliate offices in California, Colorado, the Mid-Atlantic region, and also runs a Tribal Program headquartered in Denver and an International Program that serves Nicaragua, Nepal and Mexico.In 2018 U.S. Bank expanded its national partnership to include the Tribal Program, which works with Tribal leaders to provide the resources to implement solar projects including the financing, knowhow and job training to members of the community to build the solar installations. The projects themselves not only benefit the tribal communities by reducing energy costs, providing renewable energy and job training, but also gives them more control over their energy resources - which GRID says is important as Indigenous lands that have a long history of energy exploitation.In addition of its support for the Tribal Program through grants, U.S. Bank also supports the American Indian College Fund through renewable energy scholarships - most recently funding a $25,000 in scholarships for the 2021-2022 academic year.Learn more about U.S. Bank hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734465/How-One-Nonprofit-Is-Using-Mock-Roofs-To-Grow-Solar-Jobs]"
14,b3086fd2-cb4a-3c2b-8b03-b23b0aa12aa9,CTAS,2023-01-10,Cintas (CTAS) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-ctas-incredible-growth-stock-174505128.html,1673286305,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Cintas (CTAS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this uniform rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Cintas is 16.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.2%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Cintas is 6.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -0.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Cintas have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.3% over the past month.Bottom LineCintas has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Cintas well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

17,6172773a-45c5-318b-81db-f64021739fae,WMT,2023-01-10,15 Most Progressive Companies in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-progressive-companies-america-202521760.html,1673295921,STORY,"['PGR', 'ADBE', 'MAR', 'PYPL', 'ACN', 'WMT', 'CRM', 'AXP', 'HLT', 'JNJ']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 15 most progressive companies in America. If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America.According to McKinsey, since April 2021, over 19 million US workers have left their jobs. This record-breaking rate has caused business disruption across the world. Around 53% of employers have reported observing significantly high labor turnover compared to previous years, and 64% anticipate the issue to worsen in the coming months. Companies are now actively working towards identifying challenges and establishing progressive workplace practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the evolution of the workplace culture due to lockdowns and restrictions of movement across the world. There has been increased focus on diversity and inclusion at workplaces across the US.A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that motivate employees to reach their full potential. As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diversity—through the lenses of color, gender, skill, and sexual orientation — can serve to build companies. According to McKinsey’s “Diversity Wins” report, the possibility of outperformance increases with the level of gender diversity. For instance, businesses that have more than 30% female executives do better than those that have between 10% and 30% female executives. Companies with the highest levels of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts.A sense of inclusiveness has a strong relationship with employee engagement. People who have a strong sense of inclusion are more likely than others to express enthusiasm for and dedication to their organizations. McKinsey’s research revealed that a perceived lack of inclusiveness at a company led over 40% of respondents to decline or decide against applying for a job. Progressive workplaces such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are replacing the conventional workplace model where employees work on a clock and managers enforce strict rules and regulations without any room for open communication.Story continuesPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have referred to renowned publications and websites such as Forbes, Fortune 100, and Top Workplaces to shortlist the 15 most progressive companies in America. We have used 8 articles to report the consensus picks of established publications. These companies have been ranked in ascending order in terms of the number of sources that have termed them progressive.15 Most Progressive Companies in America15. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a Mayfield, Ohio-based insurance company. It is the third biggest insurance carrier in the US, with a presence in over 50 states. Furthermore, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is also the largest US automobile insurance provider, with a headcount of 51,431 employees as of 2022.The company has the distinction of filling up 80% of jobs above entry-level positions by promoting its talent internally. This reflects the entity’s focus on promoting internal growth opportunities for its employees. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also conducts a Multicultural Leadership Development Program for its employees. Over 60% of the program graduates are promoted to higher positions. According to “Great Place to Work,” 96% of employees think that the corporation makes them feel welcome at their initiation.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Progressive Corp had a positive contribution to performance during the quarter. Net Premiums Written (NPW) grew +12% as the Company grew both policies in force and took rate to offset higher loss cost trends that are being driven by inflation. For example, we estimate accident severity for personal auto are up +35% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, this is partially offset by a 20% decline in frequency, due to people driving fewer miles. Progressive is making up for this net rise in cost by raising policy rates in the mid-teens percentage range. Progressive has been relatively early to take rate compared to industry peers, so the Company should be able to aggressively compete for share as competitors play catchup.”14. Fidelity InvestmentsNumber of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2Fidelity Investments is a Boston, Massachusetts-based privately held financial services firm that provides financial planning solutions and advice related to retirement planning, wealth management, investing, trading, and brokerage services.Fidelity Investments is ranked 27 among the best employers for diversity by Forbes. The company provides its customers with the option of sustainable investing, as two-thirds of investors think that social impact is integral in determining where to invest. Abigail Johnson has led Fidelity Investments as President and CEO of the company since 2014. According to Great Place to Work, 88% of employees at Fidelity Investment think the company provides a conducive environment for personal growth. The company also scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index last year.13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports online money transfers worldwide.Leading publication Forbes has ranked the company 20th on its list of employers known for promoting diversity in the US. Furthermore, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands 45th among the world’s best employers and holds the 123rd place among the world’s top female-friendly organizations. According to GlobalData, the company has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce. Meanwhile, 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics and Latinx, and African Americans. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also have programs related to parental preparedness and Global Wellness Days to ensure employees’ well-being.Wedgewood Partners shared its outlook on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based creative, marketing, and document management software corporation.In terms of gender representation, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) claims to have 33.6% female employees in its workforce of 25,000 employees. Women occupy 27.2% of the leadership positions in the company. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is targeting the proportion to increase to 30% by 2025 and eventually achieve gender parity. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has brought in Brian Miller as the Chief Talent, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer to ensure the company meets its strategic goals. Every year since 2001, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recognized 12 employees with Adobe’s Founder Award to honor the brightest in the company through a peer-to-peer system.Here’s what Renaissance Investment Management said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the quarter. The company reported decelerating revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but more concerning was the announced acquisition of privately held Figma for a record $20 billion. While management made a compelling case for the acquisition, the price paid revived fears that Adobe is facing increasing competitive threats.”11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) customer relationship management (CRM) company.Back in 2019, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) aimed to have half of its workforce represent minority groups. The company managed to achieve this target one year earlier, as 50.7% of its employees today belong to underrepresented groups. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) intends to connect executive compensation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals to increase accountability. Progressive initiatives at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are led by Lori Castillo Martinez as the Chief Equality Officer. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has been undertaking progressive measures for a number of years now. In 2015, the company conducted an equal pay audit that resulted in a salary adjustment of $3 million.Oakmark Funds shared its outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Rogers, Arkansas-based operator of the discount department, grocery stores, and hypermarkets. The company is the biggest retailer in the world, with a headcount of over 1.6 million employees in the US alone across its 4,000 stores.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is actively making efforts to promote a progressive work culture. As of 2022, 53% of all the company’s associates in the US are women. Meanwhile, 21% of its associates are Blacks or African American. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has also launched a progressive wage structure for its pharmacy technicians to increase their hourly wage by $4 over the course of four years. In June 2022, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) increased the average hourly wage of its 36,000 pharmacy technicians to $20 per hour.Leaven Partners shared its stance on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”9. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based operator, franchisor, and licensor of lodging services comprising hotel, residential and timeshare properties.Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) launched a $50 million development program in June 2022 focused on addressing challenges related to the underrepresentation of minorities in developing and owning hotels in the North American region. The company intends to create an expected asset value of $1 billion through the development program. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has had a diversity and inclusion program for more than two decades. The company claims to have 54% of female employees in its workforce. Overall, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) intends to have 3,000 diverse-owned hotels in its portfolio by 2025.Here’s what LRT Capital Management said about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its October investor letter:“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is the world’s largest hotel company followed closely by Hilton (HLT) and Intercontinental Hotels Group plc (IHG). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Aloft), through the mid-tier (Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels), to the luxury high end (JW Marriot, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis). In total the company had 7,642 properties with over 1.4 million rooms as of the end of Q1 2021.The majority (85%) of Marriott’s revenue comes from hotels in the United States, with the rest almost evenly split between Asia Pacific and Europe. Like it’s smaller peer, Hilton, the company today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels, not a hotel owner. The company owns 66 hotels, manages 2,083 and franchises 5,493. Like all franchise-based businesses Marriott requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Marriott currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However, the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure (the company acquired Starwood Properties in late 2016) – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid, as we expect it will, the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based payment card company.As of 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has invested $1 billion in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. The company intends to spend an additional $3 billion by 2025 to promote these initiatives. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the US for the last two consecutive years. Forbes has ranked American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the 61st position in the list of employees known for promoting diversity. In March 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) also launched its Amex Flex working system to allow employees to work either in an office or virtually. Under this initiative, 40% of employees have decided to go completely virtual.7. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a McLean, Virginia-based hospitality company with a wide variety of hotels and resorts in its portfolio.According to Great Place to Work, the company has been regarded as the best organization for diversity and parents. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) provides benefits like adoption assistance, parental leave, and GED support to its associates at its properties. The company intends to achieve equal representation of both genders in leadership positions globally by 2027 and have 25% ethnic diversity in leadership roles across the US. Furthermore, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has partnered with the Atlanta, Georgia-based Morris Brown College to create a sustainable relationship with college students by establishing a $30 million hotel and hospitality training center.Here’s what Pershing Square Holdings said about Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential, led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel, with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows, and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight, Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model, and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant, results have vastly improved throughout the year as COVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus, and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months, Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services. …” (Click here to read the full text)6. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 5Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a Dublin, Ireland-based Irish-American IT services company.Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) assesses pay-equity every year. As of November 5, 2021, the company had achieved dollar-for-dollar pay equity for male and female employees across every market in which it operates.

Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at scatter plot of all of Distillate’s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with valuation on the vertical axis and free cash ϲow stability on the horizontal axis.”In addition to Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are also on our list of the most progressive companies in America. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nuclear Energy Companies in the World10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley CompaniesDisclosure: None. 15 Most Progressive Companies in America is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(WMT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-wmt-trending-stock-140002488.html,1673272802,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest retailer have returned +1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, to which Walmart belongs, has lost 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $158.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $605.64 billion and $623.76 billion estimates indicate +5.7% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $1.50 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In a tough 2022, these 25 companies have on average loss of 6.6% in market cap, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by double digits.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is International Game Technology (IGT). IGT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Investors should also recognize that IGT has a P/B ratio of 2.29. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 6.86. Over the past year, IGT's P/B has been as high as 3.16 and as low as 1.55, with a median of 2.33.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. IGT has a P/S ratio of 1.16. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.26.Finally, our model also underscores that IGT has a P/CF ratio of 5.58. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. IGT's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 14.09. Within the past 12 months, IGT's P/CF has been as high as 6.86 and as low as 3.69, with a median of 5.32.Story continuesMGM Resorts International (MGM) may be another strong Gaming stock to add to your shortlist. MGM is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.MGM Resorts International is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 27.63 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.57. This compares to its industry's average P/E of -4,843.34 and average PEG ratio of -236.09.Over the last 12 months, MGM's P/E has been as high as 211.42, as low as -61.48, with a median of 68.26, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 7.86, as low as 1.48, with a median of 7.17.Additionally, MGM Resorts International has a P/B ratio of 2.32 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 6.86.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In a tough 2022, these 25 companies have on average loss of 6.6% in market cap, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by double digits.

31,8c3bd404-66b7-3ee4-b470-c2c22e39b0be,IT,2023-01-10,Hybrid work is expanding beyond white collar jobs to finally include frontline workers,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hybrid-expanding-beyond-white-collar-195707016.html,1673294227,STORY,['IT'],"[These days, white-collar jobs might as well be known as non-collar jobs, considering the many knowledge workers who dial in from the sofa in their T-shirts and sweats.Remote work became an unevenly distributed privilege during lockdown. While some employees were able to dodge the office and its associated pandemic risks, others risked their lives and continued to provide on-site services. Many of these frontline workers were service workers, such as grocery store cashiers, as well as some knowledge workers, such as the health care professionals working in hospitals.But as remote jobs fade nearly three years in, hybrid policies have become a major compromise between those who still want flexibility and those who want to return to in-person work (often typecast as employers and bosses, respectively).Hybrid work is still often siloed to only the white-collar worker, though. But consulting company Gartner predicts that could all change this year, asserting in its 2023 workplace forecast that hybrid flexibility will reach frontline workers.Many companies rolled out hybrid policies to try and even the playing field between those who could and couldn’t work from home, Gartner points out, mandating in-office attendance at least a few days a week. More than six in 10 companies have some on-site requirements for remote workers.2023 will see a shift: Instead of limiting flexibility to make things fair across the board, “smart organizations” will try to implement strategies that make work more flexible for frontline workers. That might look like giving them more autonomy and stability in regards to their work schedules, plus more paid leave.Some companies have already started accommodating this way of work. Fast casual restaurant DIG implemented a four-day workweek—a growing trend in knowledge workplaces—to its service employees in the second half of 2022 (after beginning the pilot in 2020), finding the rollout to boost both productivity and employee satisfaction.Story continues“If the suits can do it, why can’t we?” Brian Coakley, DIG’s director of operations, told Fortune. “Why can’t we do it in the restaurant industry?”Indeed, research shows that hybrid work can be a major key to keeping employees from quitting; hybrid workers have reported higher levels of company loyalty than their fully remote or in-person counterparts. And a study from software company Citrix also revealed that hybrid knowledge workers were more likely than their remote or fully in-office peers to connect with their coworkers in a manner that made them happier and more productive. They also reported being more connected to their leaders.Workers value flexibility so much that they’re still quitting to find it elsewhere, even as a recession looms ahead.“We’re seeing a slew of resignations from jobs that have forced employees back to the office, suggesting that workers have made workplace flexibility an ultimatum they refuse to give up—and they’re not deterred by recent layoff reports,” Lexi Clarke, VP of people at Payscale, said in a statement to Fortune in December.If hybrid work does reach more frontline industries, flexibility may become so ubiquitous that it could turn into a workplace staple rather than a workplace perk.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: San Francisco being hit with a ‘brutal’ storm so severe that a meteorologist says is ‘one of the most impactful’ he’s ever seenHow will the ultrawealthy ride out the recession? 1,200 investors worth $130 billion have one big strategyBlaming Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the COVID vaccine is ‘wildly and irresponsibly speculative,’ says expertMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

For example, low-sulphur fuel oil currently trades at about $150 a tonne above the high-sulphur variety.Diesel prices are trading at a premium of $40 a barrel above Dated Brent prices, based on Reuters assessments.(Reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Writing by Noah Browning and Ahmad Ghaddar; editing by Jason Neely and Barbara Lewis)]"

Traders are now looking to U.S. CPI data on Thursday for indications on the near-term outlook.Thursday's data ""could easily clarify the direction of the financial and oil markets for weeks to come"", said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.He said the dollar would fall if inflation came in below expectations or was below the November reading, Varga added.The dollar hovered around its weakest level in seven months. [USD/] A weaker dollar can boost demand for oil, as greenback-denominated commodities become cheaper for holders of other currencies.Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said the U.S. central bank will have to raise interest rates further to combat high inflation and that will likely lead to softer job market conditions.On Monday, both WTI and Brent climbed 1% after China, the world's biggest oil importer and second-largest consumer, opened its borders over the weekend for the first time in three years.China also issued a second batch of 2023 crude import quotas, raising the total for this year by 20% from last year.""Crude is trying to solidify a bottom, as China has lifted most restrictions to international travel and trade,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.Story continuesBut analysts said a revival of Chinese demand may only give oil prices limited support under downward pressure from the global economy.""Considering that the recovery of consumption is still at the expected stage, the oil price will most likely remain low and range-bound,"" said analysts from Haitong Futures.Barclays bank highlighted a $15-25 per barrel downside to its $98 per barrel Brent forecast for 2023 if a ""slump in global manufacturing activity worsens similar to the 2009-09 episode.""Goldman Sachs expects that the growing ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise prices without hurting demand too much will limit downside risks to its bullish oil forecast for 2023.Separately, crude stocks rose by about 14.9 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 6, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. It was expected to fall 2.24 million. EIA data is due Wednesday.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In a tough 2022, these 25 companies have on average loss of 6.6% in market cap, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by double digits.

45,42a4746f-01ec-3b57-8a7c-904722e2ce23,MS,2023-01-10,Earnings: What to expect from big banks this week,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/earnings-expect-big-banks-week-141810694.html,1673273890,VIDEO,"['CL=F', 'GS', 'JPM', 'MS', 'MS-PO', 'MS-PP', 'WFC', 'WFC-PD', 'XLF']","[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss the expectations for big bank earnings this week, as well as news that Goldman Sachs plans to cut 3,200 jobs.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are among the names that will be reporting their fourth-quarter earnings this Friday. Investors will be keeping an eye on how their mortgage businesses are holding up and listening for signs of optimism on the broader economy. Lots to unpack here with these bank earnings.Guys, is this the quarter where JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon again brings out the warning on the state of the economy? He certainly could. He's been, I think, very out in front warning about where this economy might go in 2023. Is it also the quarter where JPMorgan starts to pull back on some of its tech investments, given the slowing economy? So those are a couple of things I'm watching as pertains to JPM.And then, of course, on news today of Goldman cutting 3,200 jobs. We knew it was coming, but still to see it is, I would say, concerning, and how does how does that CEO, David Solomon, get on that earnings call and project his business looking forward?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, those job cuts coming after we had already seen from JP Morgan and some of the other banks as well, even prior to or during the holiday season, saying that, hey, we're going to need to roll back on some of the bonuses, and that really kind of brings into question what the total compensation package for the existing and the retained base of employees would look like going forward as the banks are really waiting for deal making to come back in full force, waiting to see where investment banking really kind of regains some type of strength given some of the equity-market declines that we had seen in last year.And so with all of that in mind, this earnings period and what they forecast, perhaps, is going to be the biggest kind of takeaway item and what they're seeing in terms of deal making and where they're going to be able to drum up some type of demand for their investment-banking products as well.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, when we look at the Goldman news this morning, it reminds me a little bit of what we've seen from technology because part of it is sort of a pandemic payback, if you will. That is Goldman Sachs usually does an annual culling of its underperformers. It cuts them. Didn't really do that during the pandemic. So part of this is sort of now a delayed reaction, a delayed cutting of some of those folks. That's at least some of what is going on there. But we are perhaps going to hear more about cutting from these companies, especially given that maybe they're not totally prepared for what may be coming at this point.For example, Deutsche Bank last week downgrading Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Truist saying that bank stocks have yet to fully price in a US recession. So are investors fully accounting for the effect this could have on the banks? Are the banks themselves fully accounting for the effect? I think we're going to get lots of discussion around those issues.BRIAN SOZZI: Right. It seems like there's a disconnect, Julie, because I'm looking at some Morgan Stanley price-target changes ahead of earnings. They are cutting estimates on Citigroup and Goldman Sachs pretty significantly.But if you go pull up the KBW Bank Index, as we're showing here, I mean, these stocks have gone nowhere-- really nowhere over the past year despite rising yields, and theoretically that should be good for profit margins. I would argue that chart is suggesting, you know, we're in a recession at some point this year, and that impacts a lot of the businesses beyond deal making for the banks.BRAD SMITH: It runs a little bit counter to what we typically see from some bank activity, at least, during a rising interest-rate environment. They typically would be more beneficiary where they can get more money or earn more from the difference between some of the spreads in their loans.And I think for right now, they're still trying to manage what many other businesses are in trying to understand exactly what their cost structures look like. The cut that we're seeing at Goldman is roughly double what we had seen at Morgan Stanley. That was about 1,600 employees there. And so exactly the number of people that they need in order to continue the operations or the business as usual when business right now isn't kind of that usual operating procedure, if you will, too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah,. Just to take a step back, if you look at the big businesses of the banks, right-- net interest margin, the difference between what they put out and what they take in, basically, and what they lend, that's going to obviously be a big focus this year. Fee income related to everything from mortgage servicing to the deal making that we were talking about, all of these things are going to be in flux this year and are difficult to predict, I think.]"

For example, low-sulphur fuel oil currently trades at about $150 a tonne above the high-sulphur variety.Diesel prices are trading at a premium of $40 a barrel above Dated Brent prices, based on Reuters assessments.(Reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Writing by Noah Browning and Ahmad Ghaddar; editing by Jason Neely and Barbara Lewis)]"

It is also a partner in the Ormen Lange Phase 3 project, the country's second largest gas field.British rival BP holds a minority stake in independent oil and gas firm Aker BP, the second largest Norwegian producer, while both Exxon Mobil and Chevron divested their offshore assets in Norway completely in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Beyond oil and gas, Shell is involved in several major renewables and low-carbon projects in Norway including in offshore wind blocks, a biofuels plant and the Northern Lights carbon storage and use project.Shell's annual report shows it held stakes in 21 Norwegian oil and gas production licences at the end of 2021, including a 17.8% stake in Ormen Lange, a 45% stake in the Knarr field and 8.1% of the Troll oilfield.It produced around 13,400 barrels of oil per day (bpd) and 490 million standard cubic feet per day (scf/d) in Norway in 2021, around 7% of the company's total gas production.(Reporting by Ron Bousso, additional reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis in Oslo; Editing by Alexander Smith)]"

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America.According to McKinsey, since April 2021, over 19 million US workers have left their jobs. This record-breaking rate has caused business disruption across the world. Around 53% of employers have reported observing significantly high labor turnover compared to previous years, and 64% anticipate the issue to worsen in the coming months. Companies are now actively working towards identifying challenges and establishing progressive workplace practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the evolution of the workplace culture due to lockdowns and restrictions of movement across the world. There has been increased focus on diversity and inclusion at workplaces across the US.A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that motivate employees to reach their full potential. As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diversity—through the lenses of color, gender, skill, and sexual orientation — can serve to build companies. According to McKinsey’s “Diversity Wins” report, the possibility of outperformance increases with the level of gender diversity. For instance, businesses that have more than 30% female executives do better than those that have between 10% and 30% female executives. Companies with the highest levels of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts.A sense of inclusiveness has a strong relationship with employee engagement. People who have a strong sense of inclusion are more likely than others to express enthusiasm for and dedication to their organizations. McKinsey’s research revealed that a perceived lack of inclusiveness at a company led over 40% of respondents to decline or decide against applying for a job. Progressive workplaces such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are replacing the conventional workplace model where employees work on a clock and managers enforce strict rules and regulations without any room for open communication.Story continuesPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have referred to renowned publications and websites such as Forbes, Fortune 100, and Top Workplaces to shortlist the 15 most progressive companies in America. We have used 8 articles to report the consensus picks of established publications. These companies have been ranked in ascending order in terms of the number of sources that have termed them progressive.15 Most Progressive Companies in America15. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a Mayfield, Ohio-based insurance company. It is the third biggest insurance carrier in the US, with a presence in over 50 states. Furthermore, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is also the largest US automobile insurance provider, with a headcount of 51,431 employees as of 2022.The company has the distinction of filling up 80% of jobs above entry-level positions by promoting its talent internally. This reflects the entity’s focus on promoting internal growth opportunities for its employees. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also conducts a Multicultural Leadership Development Program for its employees. Over 60% of the program graduates are promoted to higher positions. According to “Great Place to Work,” 96% of employees think that the corporation makes them feel welcome at their initiation.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Progressive Corp had a positive contribution to performance during the quarter. Net Premiums Written (NPW) grew +12% as the Company grew both policies in force and took rate to offset higher loss cost trends that are being driven by inflation. For example, we estimate accident severity for personal auto are up +35% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, this is partially offset by a 20% decline in frequency, due to people driving fewer miles. Progressive is making up for this net rise in cost by raising policy rates in the mid-teens percentage range. Progressive has been relatively early to take rate compared to industry peers, so the Company should be able to aggressively compete for share as competitors play catchup.”14. Fidelity InvestmentsNumber of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2Fidelity Investments is a Boston, Massachusetts-based privately held financial services firm that provides financial planning solutions and advice related to retirement planning, wealth management, investing, trading, and brokerage services.Fidelity Investments is ranked 27 among the best employers for diversity by Forbes. The company provides its customers with the option of sustainable investing, as two-thirds of investors think that social impact is integral in determining where to invest. Abigail Johnson has led Fidelity Investments as President and CEO of the company since 2014. According to Great Place to Work, 88% of employees at Fidelity Investment think the company provides a conducive environment for personal growth. The company also scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index last year.13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports online money transfers worldwide.Leading publication Forbes has ranked the company 20th on its list of employers known for promoting diversity in the US. Furthermore, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands 45th among the world’s best employers and holds the 123rd place among the world’s top female-friendly organizations. According to GlobalData, the company has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce. Meanwhile, 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics and Latinx, and African Americans. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also have programs related to parental preparedness and Global Wellness Days to ensure employees’ well-being.Wedgewood Partners shared its outlook on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based creative, marketing, and document management software corporation.In terms of gender representation, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) claims to have 33.6% female employees in its workforce of 25,000 employees. Women occupy 27.2% of the leadership positions in the company. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is targeting the proportion to increase to 30% by 2025 and eventually achieve gender parity. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has brought in Brian Miller as the Chief Talent, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer to ensure the company meets its strategic goals. Every year since 2001, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recognized 12 employees with Adobe’s Founder Award to honor the brightest in the company through a peer-to-peer system.Here’s what Renaissance Investment Management said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the quarter. The company reported decelerating revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but more concerning was the announced acquisition of privately held Figma for a record $20 billion. While management made a compelling case for the acquisition, the price paid revived fears that Adobe is facing increasing competitive threats.”11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) customer relationship management (CRM) company.Back in 2019, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) aimed to have half of its workforce represent minority groups. The company managed to achieve this target one year earlier, as 50.7% of its employees today belong to underrepresented groups. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) intends to connect executive compensation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals to increase accountability. Progressive initiatives at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are led by Lori Castillo Martinez as the Chief Equality Officer. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has been undertaking progressive measures for a number of years now. In 2015, the company conducted an equal pay audit that resulted in a salary adjustment of $3 million.Oakmark Funds shared its outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Rogers, Arkansas-based operator of the discount department, grocery stores, and hypermarkets. The company is the biggest retailer in the world, with a headcount of over 1.6 million employees in the US alone across its 4,000 stores.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is actively making efforts to promote a progressive work culture. As of 2022, 53% of all the company’s associates in the US are women. Meanwhile, 21% of its associates are Blacks or African American. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has also launched a progressive wage structure for its pharmacy technicians to increase their hourly wage by $4 over the course of four years. In June 2022, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) increased the average hourly wage of its 36,000 pharmacy technicians to $20 per hour.Leaven Partners shared its stance on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”9. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based operator, franchisor, and licensor of lodging services comprising hotel, residential and timeshare properties.Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) launched a $50 million development program in June 2022 focused on addressing challenges related to the underrepresentation of minorities in developing and owning hotels in the North American region. The company intends to create an expected asset value of $1 billion through the development program. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has had a diversity and inclusion program for more than two decades. The company claims to have 54% of female employees in its workforce. Overall, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) intends to have 3,000 diverse-owned hotels in its portfolio by 2025.Here’s what LRT Capital Management said about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its October investor letter:“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is the world’s largest hotel company followed closely by Hilton (HLT) and Intercontinental Hotels Group plc (IHG). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Aloft), through the mid-tier (Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels), to the luxury high end (JW Marriot, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis). In total the company had 7,642 properties with over 1.4 million rooms as of the end of Q1 2021.The majority (85%) of Marriott’s revenue comes from hotels in the United States, with the rest almost evenly split between Asia Pacific and Europe. Like it’s smaller peer, Hilton, the company today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels, not a hotel owner. The company owns 66 hotels, manages 2,083 and franchises 5,493. Like all franchise-based businesses Marriott requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Marriott currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However, the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure (the company acquired Starwood Properties in late 2016) – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid, as we expect it will, the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based payment card company.As of 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has invested $1 billion in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. The company intends to spend an additional $3 billion by 2025 to promote these initiatives. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the US for the last two consecutive years. Forbes has ranked American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the 61st position in the list of employees known for promoting diversity.

(NYSE:HLT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a McLean, Virginia-based hospitality company with a wide variety of hotels and resorts in its portfolio.According to Great Place to Work, the company has been regarded as the best organization for diversity and parents. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) provides benefits like adoption assistance, parental leave, and GED support to its associates at its properties. The company intends to achieve equal representation of both genders in leadership positions globally by 2027 and have 25% ethnic diversity in leadership roles across the US. Furthermore, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has partnered with the Atlanta, Georgia-based Morris Brown College to create a sustainable relationship with college students by establishing a $30 million hotel and hospitality training center.Here’s what Pershing Square Holdings said about Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential, led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel, with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows, and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight, Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model, and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant, results have vastly improved throughout the year as COVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus, and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months, Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

60,ca519f37-3412-38e4-bef7-7c7eaf1f625a,CRM,2023-01-10,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-salesforce-inc-140002591.html,1673272802,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +7.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.71 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.93 billion and $34.22 billion estimates indicate +16.7% and +10.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) shareholders have seen the share price rise 36% over three years, well in excess of the market return (17%, not including dividends).Since the stock has added US$375m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Sealed Air There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Sealed Air achieved compound earnings per share growth of 18% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. This free interactive report on Sealed Air's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Sealed Air's TSR for the last 3 years was 42%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 19% received by Sealed Air shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -18%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action Center.To view a public briefing that took place at 12 P.M.

The two companies have been discussing the deal for months, they added.Semafor earlier reported that the potential investment would involve other venture firms and could value OpenAI at about $29 billion, citing people familiar with the talks. Documents sent to investors had targeted end-2022 for a deal closing, it added.Microsoft and OpenAI representatives declined to comment.ChatGPT has lit up the internet since launching at the end of November, gathering its first million users in less than a week. Its imitation of human conversation sparked speculation about its potential to supplant professional writers and even threaten Google’s core search business. The organization behind it, co-founded by Elon Musk and Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman, makes money by charging developers to license its technology.The new technology is built on OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model and comes at the end of a year of headline-grabbing advances in AI. The company’s Dall-E image-generating model — which accepts written prompts to synthesize art and other images — also gave rise to a broad debate about the infusion of AI into creative industries. OpenAI is already working on a successor GPT-4 model for its natural language processing.Story continuesMicrosoft has previously invested about $1 billion in OpenAI. It’s also working to add ChatGPT to its Bing search engine, seeking an edge on Alphabet Inc.’s dominant search offering. The bot is capable of responding to queries in a natural and humanlike manner, carrying on a conversation and answering follow-up questions, unlike the basic set of links that a Google search provides.Still, concern about its accuracy — which Altman himself has said is not good enough for the bot to be relied on — has prompted caution about its premature use, and New York City schools have banned its students from accessing ChatGPT.(Updates with details of deal)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Aggressive Chip Strategy Forces China Into a CornerThe World’s Love Affair With Japanese Cars Is SouringSilicon Valley Can’t Quit Its Pizza Robot ObsessionWho Owns the Content AI Creates?It Takes 6,000 Gallons of Water to Cool the World’s Fastest Supercomputer©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

These totals would mark changes of +3.47% and +7.1%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AstraZeneca AZN and Sanofi SNY.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:The Zacks Retail – Jewelry industry is currently ranked in the top 24% (60 out of 250) of all Zacks Industries.According to studies, 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its group, making it clear why it’s critical for investors to target stocks in a thriving industry.A company residing in the industry, Signet Jewelers, has seen its near-term earnings outlook turn visibly bright over the last several months, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Signet Jewelers is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry, with its locations primarily operating under the banners of Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared, to name a few.Let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.Strong Share Performance &amp; Sound ValuationSignet Jewelers shares have been notably strong over the last three months, penciling in a sizable 25% gain and crushing the S&amp;P 500’s performance.Clearly, buyers have stepped up.Despite the strong share performance as of late, the company’s valuation multiples aren’t stretched; SIG shares currently trade at a 0.4X forward price-to-sales ratio, nearly in line with its five-year median and nowhere near its Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.Signet Jewelers carries a Style Score of a “B” for Value.Robust Quarterly PerformanceThe company has consistently exceeded quarterly estimates, beating top and bottom line estimates in ten consecutive quarters.Impressively, SIG posted a steep 150% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 8% above expectations in its latest quarter. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Story continuesDividendsDividends provide a massive boost to any portfolio, allowing investors to reap a steady income stream.And for those who seek income, SIG has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.2%, modestly above its Zacks sector average. SIG carries a sustainable 7% payout ratio.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Signet Jewelers would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Zacks Automotive – Retail and Wholesales industry has gotten off to a rough start in 2023, down roughly 8% YTD.A company residing in the realm, America’s Car-Mart, has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift negative over the last several months, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).America's Car-Mart is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, focused exclusively on the Buy Here/Pay Here segment of the used car market. Let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.Share Performance &amp; ValuationCRMT shares have struggled to find traction over the last year, down nearly 30% and underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500. As we can see in the chart below, there has been some pretty violent price action.The company’s shares currently trade at a 10.2X forward earnings multiple, beneath its five-year median and Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector average of 22.2X.CRMT carries a Style Score of a “C” for Value.Quarterly PerformanceCRMT has struggled to exceed EPS estimates as of late, falling short of earnings expectations in two consecutive quarters.In its latest release, the company fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 75% but reported sales 3% above expectations.Bottom LineA wide bottom line miss in its latest quarter and negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company in the near term.America’s Car-Mart is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have lowered their bottom-line outlook across the last 60 days.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:FDA Accepts AstraZeneca, Sanofi RSV Antibody ApplicationAstraZeneca and partner Sanofi announced that the FDA accepted their biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval for nirsevimab as a first protective option against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease for all infants. A final decision from the regulatory body is expected in third-quarter 2023.Nirsevimab is a single-dose long-acting antibody designed to prevent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) caused by RSV. If approved by the FDA, it would be the first single-dose RSV preventative option for the broad infant population in the United States.The AstraZeneca/Sanofi filing seeks approval for nirsevimab to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants entering or during their first RSV season and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.The BLA is being supported by data from the comprehensive nirsevimab clinical development program, including the phase III MELODY study, the phase II/III MEDLEY study and multiple phase IIb studies. Data from these studies showed that nirsevimab achieved consistent protection of approximately 80% against medically attended RSV disease with a single dose.Nirsevimab received its marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) in November 2022, where it is being marketed under the trade name Beyfortus. Currently, Beyfortus is approved in the EU for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV seasonIn the past year, shares of AstraZeneca have gained 23.1%, while Sanofi’s shares have lost 3.8%. During the same period, the industry has risen 15.4%.If approved within the designated time period, AstraZeneca/Sanofi expects to launch nirsevimab in the country during the 2023/2024 RSV season. Per the companies, the FDA indicated that it will expedite the BLA review timeline.Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments against RSV infections anywhere in the United States. The LRTI-RSV disease causes a high rate of morbidity and mortality in young kids.AstraZeneca and Sanofi entered into an agreement in 2017 to jointly develop and commercialize nirsevimab. Per the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities, and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenue. The two companies share costs and profits.AstraZeneca PLC price | AstraZeneca PLC QuoteSanofi price | Sanofi QuoteZacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Sanofi holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Walgreens Boots Alliance First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Global Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.Tiffany Kanaga: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Walgreens Boots Alliance Earnings Call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. I'm Tiffany Kanaga, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Roz Brewer, our Chief Executive Officer; and James Kehoe, our Chief Financial Officer; Rick Gates, Senior Vice President of Pharmacy and Healthcare at Walgreens will participate in Q&amp;A. Today's call will be approximately 1 hour in length, including Q&amp;A. Let me note that all references to the COVID-19 headwind include U.S. vaccines, drive-thru tests and OTC tests. As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 2 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website. The slides in the press release also contain further information about non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss today during this call. I will now turn the call over to Roz.Story continuesDepartment Store, StorePhoto by 卓倩 李 on UnsplashRoz Brewer : Thanks, Tiffany. And good morning, everyone. WBA entered fiscal 2023 with good momentum, and we delivered a solid start to the year. Sales grew 1% in constant currency or over 3%, excluding the headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens and tailwinds from our new healthcare assets. The decline in adjusted EPS comes against very strong growth of 53% last year and reflects the anticipated headwinds from lapping COVID execution and our investments in the U.S. Healthcare segment and labor. Our core business remains resilient despite historic macro challenges. We are driving healthy retail comp growth on top of record prior year performances. Our script volume growth is on track with plan as our restaffing and marketing initiatives are gaining traction.We made an important announcement on our opioid legal matters in November, reaching an agreement in principle to pay approximately $5.7 billion over 15 years to resolve a substantial majority of our opioid-related litigation brought by states, political subdivisions and tribes. This allows us to move forward and focus on our purpose, helping consumers lead more joyful lives through better health. We are making great progress to accelerate our transformation to healthcare, most notably in the quarter with the VillageMD acquisition of Summit Health. At the same time, we're unlocking value and strengthening the company by simplifying the portfolio. Our execution to date reinforces our confidence in achieving our full year guidance for adjusted EPS of $4.45 to $4.65.We are raising our sales guidance, and we have greater visibility toward the strong 8% to 10% core growth that underpins our results, offsetting the COVID headwind of 16% to 18%. We are quickly scaling U.S. Healthcare with a defined path to achieve profitability exiting this fiscal year. Our strategic actions are working to create sustainable shareholder value as we reimagine local healthcare and wellness for all. We are making progress against each of our four strategic priorities. U.S. and Boots UK retail comp sales were both strong, with the U.S., excluding tobacco, up over 2% on top of almost 12% last year and boots up 9% on top of 16% last year. I am especially pleased with this good performance against a tougher consumer backdrop. The convenience and value that we offer are resonating well, and our initiatives to align the core are driving traffic and margin expansion.Walgreens launched 24 hours same-day delivery, offering the widest range of retail items for around-the-clock delivery across the country. This adds to our broad range of channel access, including 1-hour delivery and 30-minute pickup. The Boots consumer responded very favorably to holiday campaigns and promotions delivering record Black Friday online sales. Boots.com was one of the UK's top 10 most visited retail website on that day. And we're maintaining price positioning versus competitors and benefiting from inventory availability through our proactive buying ahead of this year's cold, cough and flu season. In the pharmacy, our team members administered over 8 million COVID-19 vaccinations in the quarter against our goal of 16 million for the full year.Walgreens has been a leading contributor to the national pandemic response with the study from the Commonwealth Fund showing that total industry efforts have prevented 18.5 million hospitalizations, saved 3.2 million patient lives and prevented 120 million COVID infections. This adds up to an estimated over $1 trillion in medical cost savings through the U.S. vaccination program. I could not be prouder of our pharmacy team's tireless execution being among the most trusted health resources available. We continue to care for our local communities and countless ways and we are focusing investments to return stores to normal pharmacy operating hours. Pharmacy staffing has been positive nearly every week since mid-July, and we are leveraging our digital platform to reconnect on a personal level with customers.Our efforts are on pace, resulting in over 2% comp script growth excluding immunizations in the quarter, up 220 basis points sequentially. Importantly, we are seeing mid-single-digit growth in stores with normal hours. We have also opened our ninth automated micro fulfillment center, now supporting about 3,000 total stores. These facilities remove routine tasks and excess inventory from the pharmacy supporting our team and the path to script recovery. They give pharmacists more time for services and outreach that drive adherence and improve patient health. Turning to our second strategic priority. This was a landmark quarter for accelerating the build-out of our next growth engine, the U.S. Healthcare segment. We invested $3.5 billion to support VillageMD's acquisition of Summit Health, creating one of the leading independent provider groups in the country.We recognize the critical importance of scale in value-based care delivery and density in attractive markets. This highly strategic transaction expands VillageMD's addressable market with primary care, multi-specialty and urgent care and reinforces our approach across the care continuum. We see meaningful synergy potential over time. The deal is also immediately EPS accretive and accelerates profitability for U.S. Healthcare. We expect to exit fiscal '23 with positive adjusted EBITDA. Shields Health Solutions and CareCentrix continue to perform well, which led to the accelerated acquisition of both entities. Shields closed on December 28, and CareCentrix is scheduled to close in the third quarter of fiscal '23. VillageMD is leading the way in value-based care for the country, with 393 clinics as of year-end, including 200 co-located with Walgreens, achieving the calendar 2022 target.Following the close of the Summit transaction earlier this week, VillageMD now operates over 680 locations across 26 markets. We also exceeded our goal for Health Corners with 112 now versus the 100 we had expected by the end of December. Our healthcare strategy is coming to life through all of our best-in-class assets, which drove a combined 38% pro forma sales growth in the quarter. This growth is funded through actions we continue to take to better align our investment portfolio and simplify the business. In November and December, we unlocked $3 billion in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale of 19 million AmerisourceBergen shares executing with tight discounts and near 52-week highs. We also realized approximately $150 million in proceeds from the sale of our stake in GPC.Lastly, we have a strong team that is fully aligned with our strategy, including a new structure for U.S. Retail Pharmacy and John Driscoll, leading U.S. Healthcare. Perhaps most crucially, we are continuing to invest in our people, to recruit and retain the very best talent, which is key to providing a superior customer experience. Fiscal '23 includes further investments in our pharmacy team and minimum wage, as previously stated. We're also reinventing the role of the pharmacists through micro fulfillment centers and eliminating task-based metrics, further enabling them to practice at the top of their license, while creating a differentiated work environment. Our retail pharmacy business provides the foundation for our leading healthcare assets to deliver value across the full care continuum.We are able to unite digital and physical models to guide consumers through the complex healthcare landscape. We are building the scale and resources to help health plans and patients improve outcomes and lower cost as only Walgreens can do. There are significant opportunities for synergies, allowing us to pursue value-based care and risk arrangements, which will demonstrate the value of an integrated approach. We are focused on expanding our risk business supporting integrated care models, expanding our pharmacy value proposition and driving operational efficiencies. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you ahead. With that, I'll hand it over to James to provide more color on our results and our outlook.See also Citadel Stock Holdings and 11 Best Hair Care Stocks To Buy.James Kehoe: Thank you, Roz, and good morning. In summary, we had a solid start to the fiscal year. Despite the expected headwinds, the first quarter results were broadly in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our full year EPS outlook. Adjusted EPS of $1.16 declined by 29.9% on a constant currency basis as we were lapping a very strong prior year quarter when we delivered EPS growth of over 53%. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to a 19% headwind from COVID-19, U.S. Healthcare growth investments of 5% and labor investments of 5%. These were partly offset by good retail performance in both the U.S. and International segments and a favorable tax rate. Excluding AllianceRx and U.S. Healthcare M&amp;A, sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis.The core business remained resilient in a challenging operating environment. Comparable sales were up 3.8% in the U.S., despite lapping a very strong prior year comp of 7.9%. International sales grew 4.6% led by the UK and Germany. And our U.S. Healthcare business continues to rapidly scale with almost $1 billion of sales in the quarter and growing 38% on a pro forma basis. With the first quarter broadly in line, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.45 to $4.65 with 8% to 10% constant currency core growth offset by a COVID-19 headwind of around 17 percentage points. Our guidance now includes the EPS accretion from Summit Health and dilution from our reduced ownership stake in AmerisourceBergen. We have raised our full year sales guidance by over $3 billion to reflect the closing of the Summit Health transaction, refreshed currency rates and a good start to the year.Let's now look at the results in more detail. Sales of $33 billion rose 1.1% on a constant currency basis. Despite an adverse impact of 485 basis points from the anticipated decline at AllianceRx. This headwind will stop after December. Adjusted operating income declined 42% on a constant currency basis due to three factors. Firstly, a much lower contribution from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing led to a negative impact of approximately 20%. Secondly, the U.S. Healthcare adjusted operating loss was $139 million higher in the quarter, with an impact of 8 percentage points. The current quarter includes higher Walgreens Health organic investments and a full quarter of results for VillageMD compared to only 6 days of losses in the prior year quarter.Thirdly, our previously disclosed labor investments in pharmacy staffing and minimum wage, are a $100 million headwind, equivalent to 6 percentage points of AOI growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.16, a constant currency decline of 29.9%, due entirely to operating income. This was despite a favorable tax rate which benefited from the release of valuation allowances related to capital losses. GAAP earnings were a loss of $3.7 billion compared to net earnings of $3.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. The current quarter included a $5.2 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related losses, partly offset by a $900 million after-tax gain on the sale of AmerisourceBergen shares. Additionally, we are comparing to a prior year quarter that included a $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the company's investments in VillageMD and Shields.Now let's move to the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. While the U.S. performance was impacted by the anticipated COVID-19 headwinds, we do expect year-on-year performance to improve in the second half as the COVID headwind lessens and initiatives to drive script volume gain traction. Sales decreased 3% in the quarter, but if you exclude the negative impact of Alliance Rx, sales increased by 3%. The comp sales increased 3.8% despite lapping a very strong prior year comp of 7.9%. Adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion declined 35%, broadly in line with our expectations. Headwinds from fewer COVID-19 vaccinations and PCR tests and increased labor investments were partly offset by retail sales growth and gross margin expansion and savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program.Let me now turn to U.S. Pharmacy. Pharmacy sales declined 4%, held back by a 7.8 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx and by significantly lower contributions from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 4.8% despite lapping a solid 6.8% comp last year. The sales growth was favorably impacted by branded drug inflation. Comp scripts were flat. And excluding immunizations, comp scripts were up 2.1%, a sequential improvement of over 200 basis points. We administered 8.4 million COVID-19 vaccinations in the first quarter, down 46% versus the prior year quarter. Flu vaccinations were up versus prior year due to higher flu incidences. Season to-date, we have administered over 9 million flu shots. As expected, pharmacy-adjusted gross profit and gross margin declined in the quarter due to fewer COVID-19 vaccinations, a mix shift to lower margin at-home COVID-19 tests and ongoing reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings.Reimbursement was broadly in line with our expectations and represented a lower level of pressure compared to the prior year. Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. We saw good retail performance in the quarter with continued growth in both sales and margin. Retail comp sales increased 1.4% despite lapping a very strong 10.6% comp in the prior year quarter. Excluding tobacco, comps were up 2.1%. And on a 2-year stack basis, comp sales growth was 13.8%. We benefited from a 220 basis point tailwind from cough, cold, flu. However, this was largely offset by a 170 basis point headwind from lower sales of at-home COVID-19 test. Comp sales were led by 4.9% growth in Beauty and a 2.9% increase in consumables and general merchandise. Both categories benefited from own brand offerings and decisions to invest early in inventory availability.We delivered another quarter of strong retail gross margin performance, reflecting effective margin management, including strategic pricing and promotional optimization and favorable shrink trends. Turning next to the International segment, and I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Sales increased 4.6%, with growth across all international markets. Boots UK was up 4.3% and Germany wholesale grew 4.2%. Adjusted operating income was $116 million, down 20% versus prior year. Strong UK retail sales and good operational execution in the Germany wholesale business were offset by lower demand for COVID-19 pharmacy services in the UK, the adverse gross margin impact of NHS pharmacy funding and the expiration of temporary rental reductions received in the prior year.On a combined basis, these three items had an impact of around 27 percentage points. Looking forward, we do expect the International segment to return to strong profit growth in the second quarter. Early indications show that boots had a strong Christmas season with comp sales growth of around 15%. Key categories, including gifting, beauty and fragrance performed extremely well along with an uptick in OTC, cold and immunity categories. Let's now look in more detail at Boots UK. Boots UK sales growth of 4% was led by continued strong retail performance. Comparable retail sales advanced 8.7% and this is coming on top of a 16% comp growth in the year ago quarter. Footfall grew 8% with flagship and travel locations again showing robust improvement.Foods continued to gain market share with personal care and health and wellness performing particularly well. Comparable pharmacy sales declined 0.9% reflecting lower demand for COVID-19 services. Boots.com continues its strong performance with sales more than doubling versus the pre-COVID period. Approximately 18% of our UK retail sales came from Boots.com in the quarter, which compares to roughly 9% in the equivalent pre-COVID quarter. November was a very strong month with Black Friday being our biggest ever online event. Turning next to U.S. Healthcare. We are very excited about developments in our U.S. Healthcare segment as the business continues to rapidly scale. Sales were almost $1 billion in the quarter compared to only $50 million in the year ago quarter, pro forma combined sales growth of 38% compared to 34% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22.VillageMD had sales of $550 million, advancing 49% on a pro forma basis, with growth driven by existing clinic growth and expansion of the clinic footprint. Shields again showed very strong growth with sales of over $100 million and pro forma growth of 44%, driven by recent contract wins, further expansion of existing partnerships and strong executional focus. In its first full quarter, CareCentrix delivered sales of over $330 million. Pro forma sales growth was 22%. Segment adjusted operating income was a loss of $152 million. This was flat sequentially and compares to a loss of only $13 million in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $124 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $11 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in losses largely reflects a full quarter of VillageMD in the current year versus 6 days in the prior year quarter and higher Walgreens Health organic investments.These headwinds more than offset positive profit contributions from Shields and CareCentrix. Let's now look at some of the key metrics for U.S. Healthcare. As Roz mentioned earlier, VillageMD ended the calendar year with 393 clinics, including 200 clinics co-located with Walgreens. This was in line with our target. VillageMD had 440,000 value-based patients at quarter end, up 46% from 300,000 at the end of the prior year quarter. At quarter end, the Walgreens Health organic business had 2.9 million contracted lives, up from 2.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter as existing payers added new lines of business. We exceeded our original goal of 2 million lives. As we scale our access to lives and add new partners, we will continue to build out our Walgreens Health Corners.We ended the quarter with 112 Health Corners ahead of our goal of 100. Health Corners play an important role in engaging patients, addressing care gaps and improving health outcomes. Since the program was launched, Walgreens Health Corners have facilitated more than 300,000 patient interactions. In summary, we performed strongly against our key objectives and we are well positioned for future success in the coming year. The addition of Summit Health will further enhance our portfolio of leading assets across the care continuum, drive meaningful synergy opportunities and accelerate the path to profitability. Turning next to cash flow. We generated almost $0.5 billion of operating cash flow in the first quarter, while free cash flow was negative $117 million.Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by increased inventories, including successful advance pays to secure product availability in the U.S. and UK holiday seasons. The year-over-year decline in free cash flow was due to lower earnings, some phasing of working capital and increased capital expenditures related to growth initiatives, including the VillageMD footprint expansion, the rollout of micro fulfillment centers and digital and omnichannel investments. Turning now to guidance. Overall, we are confirming our full year EPS guidance. The guidance now incorporates EPS accretion from the recently closed Summit Health transaction and this offsets the dilution from our reduced ownership stake in AmerisourceBergen. Our projection for the total number of COVID-19 vaccinations is unchanged.But we do now expect a slightly greater headwind from COVID-19 testing due to a demand shift from drive-thru testing to lower margin at home test. This has had a negative impact of roughly 1 percentage point of EPS. Currency rates are somewhat favorable, and this has reduced the year-on-year currency headwind from 2% to 1%. Excluding these items, we continue to project core business growth of 8% to 10%. In terms of phasing, at the midpoint of our guidance, we see a balanced 50-50 cadence between the first half and second half versus our original expectations. This assumes a shift of COVID-19 vaccinations from the second quarter into the third quarter with an impact of approximately $0.09. Second quarter earnings growth will continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing headwind from COVID-19, continued investments in U.S. Healthcare and labor and the higher tax rate.In the second half of the year, EPS will grow around 30% with good visibility into the key drivers. Firstly, we expect significant second half momentum in U.S. Retail Pharmacy, including ongoing script recovery as we normalize store operations and implement marketing win-back initiatives; favorable trends in reimbursement net of procurement, lower levels of shrink and continued strong retail performance. Additionally, while COVID-19 will remain a headwind in the second half of the year, it will be a lot lower. And we expect an impact that is less than 50% of what we saw in the first half of the year. Secondly, International has delivered a strong Christmas trading period, and we expect to see strong ongoing performance through the balance of the year.Our international business, particularly in the UK, has emerged in a competitively strengthened position and is well positioned for growth. Finally, the first half of the year is the peak investment period for U.S. Healthcare. And consistent with prior guidance, we expect the segment to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA exiting the year. The overall segment will flip from being a headwind in the first half to a significant mid-teens EPS tailwind. Let me now provide some additional detail around our segment sales and profit assumptions. We are raising our WBA sales guidance by $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The increase is driven by VillageMD's acquisition of Summit Health, refreshed currencies and better-than-expected sales in the first quarter.Adjusted operating income is unchanged at $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion. The acquisition of Summit is offset by a lower contribution from AmerisourceBergen as we reduced our ownership stake. For U.S. Retail Pharmacy, we have raised our sales guidance by $500 million due to a better-than-expected first quarter, which benefited from brand inflation and broad-based retail strength. The AOI range is lowered by $150 million to reflect the sale of the AmerisourceBergen shares in November and December. These actions have reduced our stake from around 26% to 17%. We have raised our guidance for the International segment to reflect a lower headwind from currencies. We now expect sales of $21.2 billion to $21.7 billion up $800 million versus the prior range.We are also raising our AOI forecast to $870 million to $900 million. For the U.S. Healthcare segment, we expect sales of $6.5 billion to $7.3 billion and an adjusted EBITDA range from a loss of $50 million to positive $25 million. Both of these are consistent with the goals we provided when the Summit Health transaction was announced in November. We continue to expect to exit fiscal '23 with positive adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. Healthcare segment. Moving on to our corporate assumptions. The full year tax rate is unchanged at around 16%. Interest expense is expected to be $560 million to $580 million, an increase of $70 million to $80 million compared to prior guidance, and this is mostly due to the Summit transaction. We are raising our forecast for equity method investments and non-controlling interest with the combined range increasing by nearly $100 million versus our prior guidance.This reflects the Summit Health transaction and the acceleration of the full acquisitions of Shields and CareCentrix. In summary, we are raising our fiscal year '23 sales guidance for WBA and we are confirming our full year EPS guidance. With that, let me now pass it back to Roz for her closing remarks.Roz Brewer : Thank you, James. Before we kick off Q&amp;A, let me sum up what you've heard. We are executing against our fiscal 2023 plans with solid first quarter results reported today, broadly in line with our expectations. We performed well against our record levels of growth in the first quarter last year. Our core business is resilient, and we are accelerating our healthcare transformation with a well-defined path to profitability exiting this year. Given our first quarter execution and the Summit Health acquisition, we are raising full year sales guidance, and I'm comfortable reconfirming our adjusted EPS guidance. Our strategy is working. And we will be relentless in driving continued progress ahead. I remain confident in our future growth potential, enabled through our bold investments today and the long-term sustainable value that WBA can create for our customers, our partners, our people and our shareholders.Now I'd like to open the line for questions.

The stock has risen 37% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 14.3%.However, dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market are concerning.Growth DriversThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is focusing on increasing its global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, aggressive product innovation and brand building.Despite the pandemic, it inaugurated 1,400 stores in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, the company opened 1,173 net new stores worldwide. In the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, Starbucks opened 313, 318 and 763 net new stores worldwide, respectively, taking the total store count to 35,711.In 2023, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditure in fiscal 2023 are estimated to be $2.5 billion.Starbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. The company is leaning toward fast-growing categories like Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages and plant-based modifiers, including almond, coconut and soy milk alternatives. Apart from the numerous beverage innovations, it has been making an effort to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers.The company’s North America comps have impressed investors for the seventh straight quarter. North America comps rose 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter, owing to an improvement of 10% in average ticket.Global comparable store sales increased 7% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by an 8% rise in average tickets. For fiscal 2023, the company anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of the 7-9% target.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ConcernsCOVID-19 has negatively impacted the company’s performance in China. In the fiscal fourth quarter, comps in China declined 16% year over year. The downtick was caused by a 17% decline in transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average tickets.China continues to battle COVID-19 resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s performance in China is expected to be affected by the pandemic.Also, the company’s margin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 was affected by inflationary pressures. Increased investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training) were added concerns. Reduced traffic in China (due to COVID-19 restrictions) added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter was 15.1%, down from 19.5% reported in the prior-year quarter. However, the downside was partially offset by strategic pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets (outside China).Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Wingstop Inc.

Data from the manufacturing sector also reiterated the same, contracting in December.With wage increases slowing despite higher nonfarm payrolls, the consensus was that the central bank would slow down its interest rate hikes going forward. The markets took off on what they believed to be the end of one of the Fed’s most aggressive tightening cycles in decades.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

84,a3963851-6fe5-3f37-a2c0-a9cf4506cca9,PH,2023-01-10,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Parker-Hannifin Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-parker-133001156.html,1673271001,STORY,['PH'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Parker-Hannifin (PH) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PH for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Parker-Hannifin's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Parker-Hannifin's main business drivers.Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a global diversified manufacturer of motion &amp; control technologies and systems. The company provides precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.Diversified Industrial Segment (82.4% of first-quarter fiscal 2023 sales): This segment is engaged in the production of a wide range of motion-control and fluid systems &amp; components. The products offered by this segment are used in transportation, mobile construction, refrigeration and air conditioning, agriculture and other markets.The segment sells its products through two main channels, namely, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and extensive distribution network to smaller OEMs and the aftermarket.Products offered include sealing devices (dynamic and static); filters, systems and instruments to monitor and remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other liquids and gases; fluid connectors that control, transmit and contain fluid; hydraulic components and systems for builders and users of industrial and mobile machinery and equipment; and high-quality flow control solutions.Aerospace Systems (17.6%): This segment supervises the designing and manufacturing of products and also provides aftermarket support for a broad range of aerospace products including commercial, business jet, military and general aviation aircraft and missile.Products offered include control actuation systems &amp; components, fluid metering, delivery &amp; atomization devices, fuel systems &amp; components, pneumatic control components, hydraulic systems &amp; components and lubrication components among others.The segment's products and services are offered to OEM and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) customers throughout the world. Notably, the products are marketed by field sales employees and are sold to manufacturers as well as end customers.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Parker-Hannifin ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $3,473.88, or a gain of 247.39%, as of January 9, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 165.61% and the price of gold went up 8.24% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for PH too.Strong demand across end markets and higher orders bodes well for Parker-Hannifin. Pricing actions and benefits from the Win strategy support the company’s margin performance. The Meggitt acquisition is contributing significantly to Aerospace sales. The company has increased its organic growth and earnings forecast for fiscal 2023 to consider the benefits of the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to add 45 cents per share to Parker-Hannifin’s adjusted earnings in fiscal 2023. However, escalating cost of sales poses a threat to its margins and profitability. Realignment expenses are hurting the company’s bottom line. Foreign currency woes are impacting sales. Parker-Hannifin’s weak liquidity position is also worrisome. Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have declined 8.4% in a year's time.The stock is up 6.60% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The company’s cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions has offset the impact of the supply chain snarls and cost pressures. The Zacks analyst expect Caterpillar's adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow at 29.2% and revenues are predicted to rise 13.5%.The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment.Its dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Equinor have gained +16.1% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry’s gain of +25.3%.

Also, the company’s board increased the extraordinary cash dividend to 70 cents per share from 50 cents per share for the third quarter of 2022.However, the company’s balance sheet has significant debt exposure as compared to the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the company is not being able to capture the potential profit growth from commodity prices that have reached record highs.

The company is facing generic competition for key drug, Advair is hampering sales of GSK’s respiratory products, which we believe may not be compensated by new respiratory drugs. Competitive pressure on HIV drugs has risen.According to the analysts' estimates the GSK’s top line suggests a CAGR decline of around 3.5% over the next three years. Estimate movements have been stable ahead of Q4 results. However, GSK’s specialty products like Dovato, Nucala, Trelegy Ellipta, Shingrix, Juluca are driving sales, making up for a decline in Established Pharmaceuticals due to generic erosion.The continued recovery in Shingrix sales is encouraging. GSK has made significant progress in its pipeline. Several pipeline readouts are expected in the near term.

ADM, Corteva Inc. CTVA, Adecoagro S.A. AGRO and Alico ALCO.Industry: Agriculture OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2036636/4-steady-agriculture-operations-stocks-to-steer-through-a-wavering-industryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Logistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting the industry. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while.Nonetheless, continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Archer Daniels Midland Co., Corteva Inc., Adecoagro S.A. and Alico.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial product). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients, using gene-editing technology.The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mostly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryGrowing Organic Demand: The industry has been benefiting from an organic movement prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth.Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30) of $190 billion suggest a decline of $3.5 billion from the prior forecast. Declines in soybeans, cotton and corn exports are the key factors resulting in lower export projections. Soybean exports are likely to decline $2.4 billion to $32.8 billion due to lower production and increased competition from South America.Cotton exports are expected to be $1 billion lower than the last forecast to $6 billion due to subdued demand and reduced volumes. Grain and feed forecast is likely to be $300 million lower to $46.2 billion, reflecting declines in corn, sorghum and rice exports. The forecast for corn has declined $600 million to $18.5 billion on lower volumes. Gains in beef, poultry and wheat are expected to offset these declines.Elevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. Also, the conflict in Ukraine has been creating headwinds.The companies have resorted to solid pricing strategies to counter the rising raw material costs. The participants are looking to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses might continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #167, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in a year.The stocks in the industry have collectively risen 14.7% in a year against declines of 19.8% for the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and 5.6% for the sector.Agriculture - Operations Industry's ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.33X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.92X and the sector’s 18.94X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.71X, as low as 10.24X and at the median of 14.4X.4 Agriculture Operations Stocks to Keep an Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Agriculture – Operations universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Here, we have highlighted two stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Also, we suggest two stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from the same industry, which investors may hold on to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer Daniels:The Chicago, IL-based agricultural product company’s leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials has been a key contributor to its momentum. Its focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a significant growth driver. Solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations have been driving growth. Its Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit have been aiding the results. The company has been progressing well on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Archer Daniels is poised to benefit from the robust performance of its Nutrition segment, owing to significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Archer Daniels’ 2022 earnings has moved up by a penny in the past seven days to $7.48 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADM’s 2022 sales and earnings suggests growth of 19.9% and 44.1%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported figures. It has posted an earnings surprise of 26.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Rank #2 company has rallied 22.9% in the past year.Corteva: The Wilmington, DE-based pure-play agriculture company is poised to drive above-market growth through its industry-leading product pipeline, and rigorous approach to innovation and operating discipline. It is poised to accelerate its pace of innovation and existing leadership position in the high-value sector to meet the increasing market demand for naturally derived products through three new collaboration agreements. Strong price execution in seed, supply-chain flexibility, and solid market demand for its balanced and differentiated new product portfolios are driving CTVA’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corteva’s 2022 earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 sales and earnings suggests growth of 11.4% and 19.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported figures.

The company benefits from high asset flexibility, which gives it a competitive advantage amid the current uncertain market. Its flexibility was reflected by its ability to increase the mix of anhydrous ethanol to benefit from its high prices and recovering demand. The company’s Farming &amp; Land Transformation businesses have been benefiting from the consolidation of the five-year plan investments made in Crops, Rice and Dairy businesses, along with its focus on efficiencies.The company’s shares have risen 6.9% in the past year.

The company has a Zacks Rank #3.Alico: The Fort Myers, FL-based agribusiness and land management company is poised to benefit from the strong consumption of not-from-concentrate orange juice by retail consumers, which has been sturdy since March 2020. This has significantly aided market pricing for Early and Mid-Season, and Valencia season fruit. Driven by the strong consumption of not-from-concentrate orange juice and lower-than-normal levels of processor inventories, the company expects market prices in the next year to remain near or above the recent levels.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year loss has widened in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALCO’s current fiscal-year sales suggests a decline of 40.5% from the year-ago reported quarter.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bowman Consulting Group BWMN, Casey's General Stores CASY, Clearfield CLFD, Murphy USA MUSA and Archer Daniels Midland ADM.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Weak Economic Data a Boon for Wall Street: 5 Growth PicksA not-so-strong employment picture in December and a contraction in service sector activity showed that inflation may be cooling and that the Federal Reserve may not unleash a slew of rate hikes this year, as it did last year.Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs last month, more than analysts’ estimate of 200,000. But December’s job growth was the smallest in two years. What’s more, wage growth has begun to slow down. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3% in December, down from 0.4% in November. It’s also below analysts’ forecast of an increase of 0.4%.On a year-over-year basis, average hourly wages may have increased by 4.6% last month, but it’s down from November’s 4.8%. At the same time, average hourly wages may have risen 4.1% on an annual basis in the past three-month period, yet it’s less than 5.9% at the beginning of 2022, citing a MarketWatch article.In the meantime, the service sector activity in the United States contracted for the first time in two-and-a-half years in December. The non-manufacturing PMI of the Institute of Supply Management dropped to 49.6 in December from November’s reading of 56.5. The services PMI dropped below the 50-mark for the first time since May 2020 and indicated a contraction in that part of the sector, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.Story continuesThus, with contraction in the service sector amid weakening demand along with wage and job growth slowing, consumers’ propensity to spend is poised to decline. And with a broader pullback in consumer outlays, the price increase of essential goods and services will decline rapidly.And with ebbing inflationary pressure, the Fed is unlikely to remain hawkish this year, and achieve a soft landing, something that bodes well for the stock market. The Fed is now very much on its path to curtail economic and inflation growth while preventing the economy from entering a recession.Given such positives, from an investment standpoint, investors should place their bets on growth stocks since the broader market is pretty well set to perform better this year compared to the past year (Read More: After a Gloomy 2022, 2023 Could be Much Better: 5 Growth Picks).We have, therefore, highlighted five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

After all, it’s easy to understand why; these companies have upped their payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years, which displays their reliable nature.While that’s impressive, there’s even a step above the Dividend Aristocrats.Let me introduce you to Dividend Kings, those that have shown an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased dividend payouts.Interestingly enough, several stocks are gearing up to burst into the elite club, including Archer Daniels Midland, Sherwin-Williams and Aflac.Let’s take a closer look at each one.Archer Daniels MidlandArcher Daniels Midland is a leading producer of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from various agricultural products. ADM currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).ADM’s annual dividend currently yields 1.9%, below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, the company’s 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.In addition, it’s hard to ignore ADM’s quarterly performance; the company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in four consecutive quarters.In its latest release, Archer Daniels Midland registered a sizable 31% EPS beat and reported revenue nearly 8% above expectations.The company has a favorable growth profile for its current fiscal year (FY22), with earnings forecasted to climb 44% Y/Y. Still, the growth cools down in FY23, with estimates indicating a 15% Y/Y pullback in earnings.Sherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams manufactures and sells paints, coatings, and other related products. As it stands, the company carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesSHW’s annual dividend currently yields a respectable 1.1%, just a few ticks below its Zacks Construction sector average. Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by a double-digit 20% over the last five years.Growth is more than apparent, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.71 for FY22 indicating an improvement of nearly 7% Y/Y. And in FY23, the company’s bottom line is forecasted to expand a further 19%.AflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. Currently, AFL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aflac rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend that currently yields 2.2%, modestly below its Zacks Finance sector average.In addition, valuation multiples aren’t stretched, further reinforced by its Style Score of a “B” for Value. Currently, AFL shares trade at a 13.6X forward earnings multiple, modestly above the five-year median and nearly in line with its Zacks sector average.Bottom LineInvestors enjoy few things more than consistent, reliable dividends. After all, getting paid is an incredible feeling.And when looking to build an income stream, many turn to the Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have successfully upped their payouts for a minimum of 25+ consecutive years.However, a step above is the elite Dividend Kings group, those who have done it for 50+ years, putting their shareholder-friendly nature on full display.All three stocks above – Archer Daniels Midland, Sherwin-Williams and Aflac – are knocking on the door of the elite club.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

But December’s job growth was the smallest in two years. What’s more, wage growth has begun to slow down. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3% in December, down from 0.4% in November. It’s also below analysts’ forecast of an increase of 0.4%.On a year-over-year basis, average hourly wages may have increased by 4.6% last month, but it’s down from November’s 4.8%. At the same time, average hourly wages may have risen 4.1% on an annual basis in the past three-month period, yet it’s less than 5.9% at the beginning of 2022, citing a MarketWatch article.In the meantime, the service sector activity in the United States contracted for the first time in two-and-a-half years in December. The non-manufacturing PMI of the Institute of Supply Management dropped to 49.6 in December from November’s reading of 56.5. The services PMI dropped below the 50-mark for the first time since May 2020 and indicated a contraction in that part of the sector, which constitutes more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.Thus, with contraction in the service sector amid weakening demand along with wage and job growth slowing, consumers’ propensity to spend is poised to decline. And with a broader pullback in consumer outlays, the price increase of essential goods and services will decline rapidly.And with ebbing inflationary pressure, the Fed is unlikely to remain hawkish this year, and achieve a soft landing, something that bodes well for the stock market. The Fed is now very much on its path to curtail economic and inflation growth while preventing the economy from entering a recession.Story continuesGiven such positives, from an investment standpoint, investors should place their bets on growth stocks since the broader market is pretty well set to perform better this year compared to the past year (Read More: After a Gloomy 2022, 2023 Could be Much Better: 5 Growth Picks).We have, therefore, highlighted five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance.

Macro uncertainty forcing them to search for cost savings. More than 1/3 of those job cuts are expected in the trading and banking units. Like most big banks, Goldman has been hit by a slump in global dealmaking activity. The bank's third quarter revenue dropped 12% from a year ago. Investment banking has been the key, revenue plunging 57% year over year.They will report earnings one week from tomorrow. The big bank earnings get going on Friday. So we'll get a better glimpse at the sector. As for today, you can see shares up just over 1%. Investors, generally speaking, cheer this type of news. Could end up being the biggest layoffs since the financial crisis, Seana. Usually, I would think investors would cheer it a little bit more, being that it's fairly large cuts. But there-- looks like there's more to come in this sector.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, large cuts when you compare it to Goldman Sachs's overall workforce amounts to just over 6% of its workforce, which is actually below what was reported as kind of the upper limit last week when there were reports that Goldman could cut up to 8% of its workforce. So maybe this is less than what the Street was expecting.It's going to be interesting to wait and see what we hear from David Solomon, what we hear from a number of the bank CEOs over the next week or so, because I think a lot of the market activity, at least over the next several weeks, is kind of going to be based off of what we did hear from the banks. We know how integral, how important they are to this earnings season. We heard it from Brad, our markets guest earlier on in the program, that's really going to set the pace and really set the scene for earnings this season when so many analysts are worried about some of those downward revisions and how bad it could potentially get.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In a tough 2022, these 25 companies have on average loss of 6.6% in market cap, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by double digits.

Netflix’s hiring of Karbowski comes after the company had hired former Electronic Arts finance exec Ken Barker for the job last year — before he resigned after about three months.A nearly 10-year veteran of PayPal, Karbowski served in various roles at the online payment processor since May 2013. He was chief accounting officer since August 2020, and prior to that was VP, global controller from October 2019 to August 2020. Karbowski was senior director, controller for PayPal from June 2015 to September 2019.Prior to joining PayPal, Karbowski served as the director of accounting at Skype, a division of Microsoft, and before that was a senior manager at consulting firm EY.

After years of significant content-spending increases, Netflix in 2022 was targeting programming expenses of $17 billion, flat with the year prior.Starting with Netflix’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings report, scheduled for Jan. 19, the company will not provide subscriber guidance for the next quarter (Q1 of 2023).

The show was co-executive produced by Takeuchi and “Gravity Falls” creator Alex Hirsch.The first half of “Inside Job” (10 episodes) premiered on Netflix in October 2021, and the second part (eight episodes) debuted this past November.

Despite her optimism, Reagan faces constant hurdles on the way to her dream promotion including her unhinged, conspiracy-mongering father (Slater) and irresponsible coworkers.“Reagan and Brett deserved to get their ending and finally find happiness.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.08%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.34%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 11.55%.Coming into today, shares of the world's largest biotech drugmaker had lost 1.24% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector gained 0.62%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.03%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Amgen as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Amgen is projected to report earnings of $4.02 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 7.8%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.74 billion, down 1.57% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amgen. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.02% lower. Amgen is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Digging into valuation, Amgen currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 14.93. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.24.We can also see that AMGN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.95. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. AMGN's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.57 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 56, which puts it in the top 23% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Be sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

132,aa7ffc54-5bd5-3de2-9170-dd14ec6851a4,AMGN,2023-01-10,Why Amgen (AMGN) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-amgen-amgn-poised-beat-171005554.html,1673284205,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Amgen (AMGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest biotech drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.89%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Amgen came out with earnings of $4.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.43 per share, representing a surprise of 6.09%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.40 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.65 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.68%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Amgen. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Amgen currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.25%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you can make it in a market like 2022, imagine what can happen in 2023 for many top pharma stocks.What the best pharma stocks have in common is pricing power, patented medicines, big moats and wide margins. They’re also members of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group that has fought for decades to keep prices high.Pricing is the key risk for these companies. The Inflation Reduction Act lets Medicare negotiate on prices for the first time. The Biden Administration is already touting a $35/month cap on insulin prices under the law.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut that could just be the start. If drugs cost less under Medicare than with private insurance, patients and plans may demand to be let in on the savings. The government will push drugmakers to compete on price, squeezing margins. Insurers may join them.That said, this trade group has dramatically weakened the final bill. It still has enormous power, before courts, legislators and regulators, even manipulating public opinion directly.The bottom line is that the law will be less-effective than advertised, at least in 2023, with many provisions failing to take effect for years. Thus, the industry has time to adapt, giving investors time to load up on thee top pharma stocks.MRKMerck$113.82LLYEli Lilly$360.18AMGNAmgen$267.83BMYBristol-Myers Squibb$72.33REGNRegeneron Pharmaceuticals$728.36Merck (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) had a spectacular 2022, with its stock rising 44% as the average stock in the S&amp;P 500 fell almost 20%. This brought the market cap of one of the top pharma stocks in the market to $280 billion in early 2023.Merck is best known for Keytruda, its anti-cancer immunosuppressant. But there’s a lot more to like, according to analysts. It has a COVID-19 pill called Lagevrio. It is also working with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) on a cancer vaccine. To keep growth going, it is buying Imago Biosciences (NASDAQ:IMGO), which is working on blood diseases. Thus, this is one of the top pharma stocks making waves in many areas of the market.Story continuesIn 2022 Merck saw record sales, higher profits, and promising results in clinical trials. Sotatercept, its hypertension drug acquired with Acceleron in 2021 for $11.5 billion, met the main goal on its latest clinical trial. The company’s early bet on using peptides to help otherwise-toxic drugs reach their targets is paying off.Merck remains a conservative investment. Its 73 cent per share dividend still yields 2.6%. Its price-earnings ratio of 18-times is not out of line, given 20% top-line growth and 17% profit growth. It even managed a successful CEO transition to Robert Davis.Technicians like Merck’s chart pattern and none of the 16 analysts following Merck at Tipranks want you to sell it, even at $110/share. In fact, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) recently raised its price target to $125/share.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock had a stellar 2022, rising nearly 33%. Its market cap entering January was about $347 billion. The company has a large lead in treating diabetes that is leading to breakthroughs in weight loss.Lilly may look overvalued with a price-earnings multiple of 55-times, and a 2022 growth rate of under 10%. That said, its best seller right now is Trulicity, a diabetes treatment that brought in nearly $6.5 billion last year. Past hits include Prozac for depression, Zyprexa for psychosis, and Humulin, a bio-engineered form of insulin. It is also delivering a long-acting insulin called Rezvoglar, which would be interchangeable with Sanofi’s (NYSE:SNY) Lantus. This could drive down the cost of diabetes care.But Lilly’s future looks even better than its past. Mounjaro, originally created for diabetes as tirzepatide, may find new sales as an obesity treatment. This would make it what our Louis Navillier calls a “mega blockbuster.” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) thinks Mounjaro could ring up sales of $50 billion. That’s more than Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) COVID vaccine, Comirnaty.Lilly is already expanding its manufacturing capacity in expectation of a quick approval. Lilly has another drug called retatrutide, about to go into Phase 3 testing, that could be even more effective. The drug works by mimicking a hormone that drives hunger, and by causing food to clear from the stomach more slowly.Small wonder that 11 of 13 analysts at Tipranks want you to buy LLY stock, with a price target of $400, 10% above its current level.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock managed to gain 17% in 2022, while the average S&amp;P stock lost 20%. This is among the most valuable pharma stocks out there, with a market cap of approximately $139 billion, a price-earnings ratio 21-times, and a fat dividend yield of 3.2%Amgen’s best seller, Enbrel, is an anti-cancer drug that had $6 billion of sales in a single year. It also sells Prolia, a shot for strengthening bones, an auto-immune drug called Otezla for psoriasis and arthritis, and an osteoporosis treatment called Xgeva. All are doing better than expected, and I expect Amgen to remain among the top pharma stocks for some time to come.But the real excitement surrounds the pending purchase of Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP) for nearly $28 billion. Horizon makes drugs for rare autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Its best known drug is Tepezza, used to treat thyroid eye disease.Each of Horizon’s drugs may have relatively modest sales. Tepezza had less than $500 million last year. But rare disease drugs have an easier time winning approval, and pricing is seldom an issue. To some analysts, this makes investing in Amgen a “no-brainer.” They point to the $11.7 billion it had in cash at the end of September, and operating cash flow of over $9 billion, which makes its acquisitions affordable.This view is not universal, however. Bears point to $37 billion in long-term debt even before the Horizon purchase, which came after Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) both expressed interest. Four of the company’s 16 analysts at Tipranks are telling clients to sell it.Amgen could also get a boost if it wins its effort to revive patents on its biologic Repatha, and block the sale of competing drugs from Sanofi and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The issue is how narrowly patents must be written and how different competing drugs must be to avoid violating them.Bristol-Myers (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock had a solid 2022, up over 16%. The company also hiked its dividend in December to 57 cents, meaning it now yields over 3.1%.The company’s best-selling drugs are Revlimid for multiple myeloma, Eliquis, a blood thinner, and Opdivo, which competes with Merck’s Keytruda as an anti-cancer immunosuppressant. All three, however, go off-patent later this decade.The company bought Celgene (makers of Revlimid) for $74 billion in 2019, which kept the stock’s performance down until 2022. The year was helped by $15 billion in stock buybacks to support the stock price. By September, the company still had $9.1 billion in cash and equivalents on its books.BMY got good news from regulators in 2022, who approved three new Bristol-Myers drugs, the most from any maker. These include a melanoma drug called Opdualag, which will help extend the patent life of Opdivo, Camzyos for a genetic heart disease that thickens the muscle and slows blood flow, and Sotyktu, an oral drug for severe psoriasis to compete with Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) Humira. Each are expected to become a $4 billion franchise over time.Some analysts are worried about expiring patents and slowing approvals, turning negative on Bristol-Myers. Most of the 11 following it are in the hold camp, with three saying buy and one saying sell.Regeneron (REGN)The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of top pharma stock to buy is Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The company had a decent 2022, with REGN stock rising about 15%. This brought the company’s market cap to $78.5 billion, despite it having no dividend. Regeneron’s price-earnings ratio is 15-times.I have long been a fan of Regeneron thanks to their VelociSuite, which models what potential drugs might do on mice. I think having a system for drug discovery delivers more long-term value than just having a hit drug.While Regeneron is losing patent protection on Eylea, which fights macular degeneration, it has new blockbusters in Dupixent, an autoimmune drug, and Libtayo, which competes with Merck’s Keytruda.Regeneron was thought to be a COVID play in 2021 with its REGN-COV, but a cut in government funding recently caused it to cut four clinical trials of the drug. It also recently dropped work on medicines for chronic pain and cat allergies. One area where Regeneron is not cutting back is on obesity, where it’s working with a gene called GPR75 that can protect people from getting fat. It is trying three different methods for developing a drug in this area.Research cutbacks led to a bad third quarter, with sales and profits both down from a year earlier. This led analysts to downgrade their outlook on Regeneron stock. At Tipranks, only 7 of 13 want you to buy it, and 1 is telling clients to sell.While Regneron may look down now, I still think it’s the best of the five pharma stock studied here for the long term.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in MRNA and BAC.

However, the company's investment banking revenue, while down 38% from an off-the-charts 2021, had its second-best year and was significantly higher than in 2019. Q4 EPS was $0.57, in line with the consensus expectations, while revenue of $1.44 billion came in better than the consensus estimate of $1.17 billion.Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) shares plunged more than 9% after the company updated its Q4 guidance. While Q4 revenue is expected to come in better than the consensus estimate, the company disappointed investors by anticipating Q4 gross margins to decline 90-110 basis points compared with its previous expectation for an increase of 10-20 basis points. Q4 EPS and revenue are now expected to be in the range of $4.22-4.27 and $2.66-2.70 billion, compared to the prior guidance of $4.20-4.30 and $2.61-2.66 billion, respectively.Shares of Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) gained more than 5% after the company announced it expects Q4 and fiscal 2022 results to come in near the high end of its guidance range. The company announced that net sales for the Holiday Period (October 30, 2022, to January 07, 2023,), which includes New Year's Day, grew 11.2% year-over-year to $1,003.7 million. The company's previously provided guidance given on its Q3/22 earnings call saw sales between $1.08 billion and $1.10 billion for the entire Q4.Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) shares closed more than 7% lower after the company announced updates to its Q4 sales and adjusted EPS guidance. Net sales are now expected to be at the low-end to mid-point of the previously issued range of $8.161 to $8.401 billion, while adjusted EPS is expected to be in the previously issued range of $1.47 to $1.67.Story continuesAbercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.

Jill Inc. and others were also out and about, whether just meeting with investors, giving presentations to analysts or tweaking their numbers.Macy’s Inc. started the ICR holiday reveal ball rolling on Friday, noting that its quarterly numbers would hit its target, but that the lulls during nonpeak times last month were worse than expected.At the conference on Monday, Jeff Gennette, Macy’s chairman and chief executive officer, said the company was going to be “more conservative” this year, but ready to ramp up inventory with “a healthy open-to-buy reserve” if consumers start buying.Brooke Roach, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, described the Macy’s financial update as “a mixed to slightly weaker read-through for key apparel vendors such as PVH Corp., Ralph Lauren Corp., Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and VF Corp.…where weaker sales trends outside of key event-driven periods could weigh on 2023 growth momentum.”Across the broader retail landscape, there were indications of retrenchment.“We see the updates as largely negative for the softlines group, with few outperformers on sales, and more comments on weaker margin trends vs. our prior expectations,” Roach said.One sign of comparative strength came from American Eagle Outfitters and Abercrombie, which the analyst noted, “reported stronger results and called out inventories in line with prior expectations, a positive read-through to select specialty retail promotional pressure.”Story continuesOliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen, saw a retail picture of “stabilizing inventory, but uncertain consumer demand.”“We are seeing more normalizing inventory levels with retailers, such as Macy’s, American Eagle Outfitters and Tilly’s, highlighting a cleaner inventory as we enter 2023.” “American Eagle Outfitters now expects inventory down year-over-year in the fourth quarter and Macy’s also noted that their inventories are down low-single digits year-over-year. As the overall inventory position is much leaner heading into fiscal year 2023, we expect stabilizing promotional trends, but it is likely that average unit retail will remain pressured compared to last year, especially in the first half,” Chen wrote.Investors ran hot and cold.Among the stocks declining on quarterly updates were Lululemon, down 9.3 percent to $298.66; Chico’s, 8.4 percent to $4.82, and Macy’s, 7.7 percent to $20.43. American Eagle was up for most of the day, but closed down 0.6 percent to $14.91.Abercrombie was the outlier, with its shares gaining 8.7 percent to $27.40.Here, a closer look at how some of fashion’s major retail players are positioning themselves after the holiday season and pitching investors on their plans to power through 2023.Macy’s Inc. In sync with the consumers it serves, Macy’s Inc. is holding back on the buying.“When you think about how we’re looking at 2023, we’re going to be more conservative with our receipts, and we’re holding back a healthy open-to-buy reserve to be able to respond as the customer does, by category, in the season,” Gennette said during his presentation at the ICR Conference.Gennette said Macy’s is “taking a cautious view” but “will be ready if the customer pivots,” meaning the company will be in a position — and is agile enough — to chase brands and items as trends emerge.He said the $24 billion Macy’s Inc. has “a very strong balance sheet, which gives us the flexibility and the agility to be able to respond as the customer goes.” The company is “developing a stronger prowess with inventory freshness and really just being laser-focused on inventory control and inventory productivity,” Gennette said.He said Macy’s is focusing on “fashion and trends that [aren’t] necessarily dedicated to a particular brand,” but is oriented to how customers might see themselves dressing and how they might be inspired to dress.A big element of Macy’s merchandise strategy entails a three-year program to reinvent all of its private brands, “either refreshing existing ones or developing new ones, and really looking at the life stages of our very diverse, multigenerational customer base and ensuring that we have the right content that we uniquely control.”Gennette said the company’s private brand business, as a percentage of the total business, will go up. “You’re going to see the [cost of goods sold] improvement in that and the profitability opportunity that’s going to come from that. And a testament to that is what’s been happening with the INC brand, which is our number-one women’s sportswear brand. That has been under development over the past year, and you really see it in the comps that we’re now getting.”In an interview with WWD last October, the CEO said private brands represented 16 percent of Macy’s total business and that of all the businesses at Macy’s, private brands would grow at one of the fastest rates. Another 10 percent-plus of Macy’s volume is generated by exclusive merchandise from brands that aren’t exclusive to the store, bringing its level of merchandise exclusivity to more than 25 percent of the assortment.Macy’s move into an online marketplace format has enabled the company to offer, so far, 400 brands it didn’t offer before. “The big hallmark there is the amount of tangential categories that we’re now in and categories that, frankly, from an owned and licensed model were not profitable for us to carry,” Gennette said. “Now with marketplace, we have a new model that gives us lots of leverage in categories that customers expect from us and trust us to carry at profitable levels. In the holiday time frame, you saw that in the electronics business, in the game business, with the Xbox business. Those were all the bestsellers for us, during the holiday season.Later this year, the Bloomingdale’s division of Macy’s Inc. will begin to phase in its own online marketplace model.Macy’s media network, Gennette added, also helps the company attract new brands “with a new profit pool….It’s becoming marked in terms of its contributions to our overall profitability.”Last Friday, Macy’s issued preliminary results for the fourth quarter, which ends Jan. 28. The retailer’s fourth-quarter net sales are now expected to be at the low end to midpoint of the previously issued range of $8.16 billion to $8.4 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the previously issued range of $1.47 to $1.67.The company expects to report full results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 in early March. The guidance for the period was provided during the company’s Nov. 17, 2022, earnings call on the third quarter.On a percentage basis, total end-of-quarter inventories are on track to be slightly below last year and down midteens relative to 2019.During the ICR presentation, Gennette said his team “did a good job of executing a very competitive quarter. It was particularly competitive all the way through.”Gennette said that similar to 2019, peak sales periods in 2022 occurred during Thanksgiving week, the week after which included Cyber Monday and weeks four and five of December. However, he also cited “deeper-than-expected lulls” in weeks two and three of December as well as weeks one through three of November.On the positive side, “all through the holiday season, both Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury and the luxury sector were quite healthy and they outperformed.”“Overall, we’ve responded quite well to what we needed to do with planned promotions to respond to the competitive environment. What we saw was occasion-based shopping was robust, as was gifting as we got into the balance of the Christmas-Hanukkah time frame. And that was fortified through what we are doing with pricing science as well as our commitment on newness,” the CEO said.Gifting and occasion-based shopping have been strong since the first quarter and through the fourth quarter, in particular dress-up shoes, men’s suits and luggage, Gennette said.On the other hand, “When you look at the self-purchase, [with] a lot of the sportswear businesses, casual apparel and some of the home categories, that lull was deeper than we expected. We’re thinking about self-purchase as a more fundamental part of the first half of 2023 as a percent of our overall sales,” Gennette said.Adrian Mitchell, Macy’s Inc. chief financial officer, added: “Clearly, for the holiday season, folks were buying toys. They were buying occasion-based items, they were buying gifting. But for things for themselves and their homes, that’s where we saw the drag.“We look at our credit card data; there are some indicators that continue in a direction where payment rates are deteriorating, debt balances are higher. And that’s an indication that the consumer just has less capacity to spend,” Mitchell said.“As we look at the macro factors, we see that inflation continues to outpace wage growth; wage growth is beginning to slow down. Inflation is beginning to slow down, but the capacity to spend is really under pressure and we believe that’s going to continue into 2023.”Lululemon’s stock fell on gross margin worries.Lululemon Athletica Inc. Lululemon Athletica Inc. rattled investors Monday morning with a fourth-quarter outlook that showed some gross margin slide even as profits were seen coming in on target.Shares of the active firm fell sharply as investors read the tea leaves of gross margins, which the active giant said would decline by 90 to 110 basis points this quarter instead of gaining 10 to 20 basis points, as previously projected.However, the firm said it would “leverage” its selling, general and administrative expenses by 100 to 120 basis points, instead of the previously expected 30 to 50 basis points, helping to keep the bottom line on track.Lululemon narrowed its forecast for diluted earnings per share and is now seeing a range of $4.22 to $4.27 where it previously projected profits of $4.20 to $4.30. Fourth-quarter sales are slated to range from $2.66 billion to $2.7 billion, an increase of 25 to 27 percent from a year earlier. Before, the company forecast sales between $2.605 billion and $2.655 billion.The update raised some questions about the brand situation at the business, which has constantly been ahead of the fashion and retail curve.Simeon Siegel, a stock analyst at BMO, said stock multiples are often tied to revenues, but that the top line can be a lagging indicator.“Quality of sales erode before actual sales,” Siegel said.Hence, the focus on gross margins.“Lululemon’s clearly a strong brand with a strong Wall Street fan base — count us in it — but, we fear brand saturation questions are becoming hard to ignore,” he said.The company will be meeting with investors at the ICR retail conference this week and might offer some more color on results.“The question is, did Lululemon take their inventory medicine, weighing on gross margins, now entering fiscal year 2023 clean?” Siegel said. “That would be the silver lining of the release. If not, and inventory remains elevated, it will be hard to ignore the margin questions we’ve been asking over the last several quarters.”Calvin McDonald, Lululemon’s CEO, said he was “pleased” with the companies’ top-line growth and momentum in a “dynamic macro-backdrop.”“In [the fourth quarter], traffic remains strong across both physical and digital channels, and we anticipate delivering another quarter of solid earnings growth consistent with our updated EPS forecast,” McDonald said, adding that “2022 has been a strong year for Lululemon, and we remain focused on the significant opportunities ahead as we continue to deliver on our Power of Three x2 growth plan.”America Eagle’s Aerie brand continues to show gains.American Eagle Outfitters Inc. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. is coming out of the holiday season with revenues and profits on track to hit the high end of its projections.But sales still showed a modest decline from a year earlier as the consumer mentality shifted from have-to-buy-before-it’s-all-gone to something more cautious given inflation and the threat of recession.The retailer, which is parent to American Eagle and Aerie, said its fourth-quarter brand revenues were down about 3 percent as of Saturday. That puts the company, which projected in November that revenues would be down by midsingle digits, at the higher end of its guidance. By brand, the third-quarter trends carried over into the fourth quarter, which has Aerie leading the way. AEO’s Quiet Logistics business is expected to add 2 percentage points to its fourth-quarter brand revenue.The company also sees gross margins coming in at the high end of its guidance, set at 32 to 33 percent in November.Jay Schottenstein, AEO’s executive chairman and CEO, said, “Following record performance last year, we achieved our second-highest holiday sales period in company history. I am pleased with results across our brands, and to see profit margins tracking at the high end of our expectations, powered by excellent inventory management and promotional discipline.“Looking ahead, we are focused on delivering a leading customer experience across brands, while prioritizing free cash flow and shareholder returns,” Schottenstein said.Inventories at the end of the quarter are expected to be down compared with a year earlier.That reflects the much more cautious stance the industry is taking heading into 2023.The question that remains is just how much inventory is left in the overall retail system — and that will become clearer as more retailers weigh in with holiday results.In holiday 2021, COVID-19 supply chain backups caused out-of-stocks that helped spur shoppers to buy at full price. Last year, merchants stocked up only to find the consumer had cooled.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. upped its outlook for the 2022 fourth quarter and full year and is now expecting to post positive sales instead of declining sales.“I am pleased with our quarter-to-date performance. Our brands performed well during the peak holiday selling period, delivering sequential sales trend improvement from third-quarter levels, leading us to increase our fourth-quarter sales and operating margin outlook,” Fran Horowitz, A&amp;F’s CEO, said Monday in a statement.“The strong momentum we have seen all year at the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch brand continued in the holiday season with the women’s business on track to deliver its highest fourth-quarter sales ever,” Horowitz said. “Importantly, this strong performance has been complemented by an acceleration in men’s growth from third-quarter trends.“For Hollister, while we expect to finish the fourth quarter with sales below 2021 levels, the sales trend improved nicely from third quarter as we have begun to realize initial benefits from assortment adjustments and personnel changes.”For the fourth quarter, the company now expects sales to be up 1 to 2 percent, compared to the previous forecast of down 2 to 4 percent.The operating margin is seen in the range of 6 to 8 percent, up from the previous forecast of from 5 to 7 percent.For the full fiscal year, net sales are now seen as down around 1 percent, compared to the previous forecast of being down 2 to 3 percent. The operating margin is seen coming in at 2.5 to 3 percent, compared to the earlier forecast of 2 to 3 percent.Horowitz said that for 2023, the company is playing it cautiously. “We continue to balance playing both offense and defense in this evolving macroeconomic environment,” she said. “We are managing operating expenses tightly, and we continue to target an inventory level consistent with 2021 by year end, positioning our brands to chase receipts in the spring season. At the same time, we are leveraging the company’s strong financial position to drive key, long-term investments in our operations, specifically in technology, stores and supply chain. We believe these investments will best position us to achieve our 2025 Always Forward Plan.” The three core principles of the Always Forward Plan are:execute focused brand growth plans;accelerate an enterprise-wide digital “revolution,” andoperate with financial discipline.White House Black Market showed softness for Chico’s in the fourth quarter.Chico’s FAS Inc. Chico’s FAS Inc. — parent to Chico’s, White House Black Market and Soma — gained ground during the holidays with a 4.9 percent sales gain, but fell short of its projections and felt the sting in its stock price.The retailer said sales would range from $505 million to $515 million in the quarter, instead of the $535 million to $555 million it expected just before Thanksgiving.Accordingly, the company said its fourth-quarter bottom line would range from a loss of 2 cents a share to flat instead of the 7 cent to 10 cent gain previously projected.P.J. Guido, Chico’s chief financial officer, said: “Coming out of [the third quarter] and moving into November, performance remained strong through Cyber Monday. As we moved into December, we did start to see a tick down in store traffic that impacted sales relative to our forecast.”Sales remained healthy at Chico’s and continued to improve at Soma, but White House Black Market was softer in styles like party dresses and heavy sweaters.]"

We want to take a look at some of the big movers of the day. First up, let's take a look at Duck Creek Technologies. You're looking at gains today of just about 46%, this massive move to the upside that we're seeing coming after Vista Equity Partners coming out saying that they plan to take Duck Creek private in an all-cash $2.6 billion deal. The stock now trading just around $19 per share, which was offered by Vista.Now, the deal expected to close in the second quarter of the year, would bring an end to what has certainly been a tumultuous run in the public markets for Duck Creek. Now, Duck Creek IPOed back in 2020. And we take a look at that MAX chart, you can certainly see we're well off the highs there, the all-time high just below $60 a share. Where we are today with today's massive jump, still just around $19 a share. And, Dave, taking a look at those losses from that MAX chart of just about 52%.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: It needed to do something.DAVID BRIGGS: That's where I was going to go with this. It really depends on your perspective. $59 is a significant mark down from their peak. But where they're trading now, massive upside compared to where that stock has traded at after losing, what, 60% they lost from their market cap just last year.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a tough environment there for the company. Let's take a look at Alibaba because a big move to the upside today in an intraday basis. We're looking at gains of just about 3%, now rising with founder Jack Ma relinquishing his ownership stake in fintech firm Ant over the weekend.BABA also receiving positive notes from Morgan Stanley and Goldman today. Morgan Stanley listing BABA as one of its top tech sector picks. Morgan Stanley believing that investors have underappreciated Alibaba's leverage to a consumption recovery in China. Now, shares of Alibaba have lagged over the last year. China's COVID recovery has been slower than initially anticipated.Story continuesTaking a look at what we've seen over the last couple of months, we're looking at huge gains of just about 36%. But of course, that jump there, Dave, coming after what has been a rough go at it for the company over the past two years. We're still looking at losses of about 53%.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, speaking of tumultuous, with Jack Ma and Ant Group, go back to October 2020 when it was nearly worth $900 billion. And he said, quote, ""Without risk, no innovation can happen in this world."" The very next month, they whacked that IPO, cracked down on China's big tech, and the rest has been that chart--SEANA SMITH: Yeah, been trading--DAVID BRIGGS: --you're looking out right there.SEANA SMITH: --just along the bottom here over the last year. And today, right around $110 a share. Let's take a look at Macy's very quickly, a mover here in today's action, looking at losses of just about 7%. Now, this coming after the retailer warned investors it might not be too happy with their holiday season numbers here. Macy stating that its fourth quarter net sales will likely come in at the low to midpoint of initial guidance. So things certainly not looking too optimistic with the stock today, Dave, of losses of just about 7 and 1/2%, still above $20 a share.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Cardinal Health CAH, Conagra Brands CAG, Ingredion INGR, Atmos Energy ATO and NRG Energy NRG.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Top Recession-Proof Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2023The U.S. labor market continues to exhibit strength despite the Federal Reserve’s most aggressive monetary policy in nearly four decades and amid mass layoffs at tech bigwigs such as Amazon and Salesforce, to name a few.The ADP National Employment report showed that private employers in the United States increased jobs by 235,000 in December, well above the estimate. Additionally, workers’ pay also improved.Not only that, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits too declined last week. The Labor Department added that on a seasonally-adjusted basis, initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec 31, dropped to 204,000, its lowest level since September.Unfortunately, healthy employment news raised concerns about more rate hikes this year. After all, an increase in employment may lead to an uptick in consumer outlays, and push prices of essential goods and services higher. But the Fed, at present, is bent on taming a considerably high rate of inflation toward its target range of 2%.Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting had already shown that 19 top central bank officials don’t expect any cut in interest rates to be appropriate this year, and they are willing to wait for further evidence that inflation is declining at a sustainable rate. Lest we forget, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said earlier that the labor market needs to weaken and prevent wage growth that can fuel inflation.Thus, with the Fed expected to tighten its monetary policies amid a strong labor market, increase borrowing costs and dampen consumer outlays, the economy is certainly facing a recession shortly. The International Monetary Fund, too, had warned that one-third of the global economy may face a recession this year.Story continuesHowever, investors shouldn’t freak out! Defensive companies are generally recession-proof. These companies are non-cyclical in nature, or in other words, their performances are not dependent on the happenings in the larger equity market.Defensive players belong to the healthcare, consumer staple and utility sectors. This is because consumers still need to purchase essential items, including medical care, food, electricity, natural gas, water and various other energy products, irrespective of the economic situation.Further, dividend-paying defensive companies are even a better choice as it assures a steady stream of income. And why not? Dividend payers have solid business models that help them sail through any market upheaval.Investors, therefore, should place their bets on dividend-paying recession-proof stocks such as Cardinal Health, Conagra Brands, Ingredion, Atmos Energy and NRG Energy. Currently, these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and offer high yields. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and manufacturers.

""With the transition comes a need to evolve the public vehicle charging network, and today's charging infrastructure is insufficient to support a drastic increase in the number of EVs in operation.""S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates there are about 126,500 Level 2 and 20,431 Level 3 charging stations in the United States today, plus another 16,822 Tesla Superchargers and Tesla destination chargers. The number of chargers has grown more in 2022 than in the preceding three years combined, with about 54,000 Level 2 and 10,000 Level 3 chargers added during 2022.Charging Definitions•AC Level 1: What most people will have in their homes, and equivalent to a 110v wall outlet. Would require 20 hours to fully recharge an EV.•AC Level 2: Equivalent to an upgraded home charger that uses a 208-240 volt circuit (used for an electric clothes dryer) and usually requires a 50-amp breaker for each charger. Takes about five hours to fully recharge an EV. Often also seen in shopping centers.•DC Level 3 Fast Charging: Requires a much larger grid connection to convert the AC current to DC. An EV's battery management system must be able to handle the rapid flow of electricity – currently as high as 350 kW. Takes 15-20 minutes to recharge most DCFC-ready vehicles from 10% to 80% state of charge.•Tesla Supercharging: Can add about 200 miles of range to a Tesla vehicle in 15 minutes. Tesla has offered converters to other brand vehicles for use in its Superchargers in Europe, with plans for US adaptation in the works.Source: EVgoS&amp;P Global Mobility registration data shows that there are 1.9 million electric vehicles (EVs) in operation today, or 0.7% of the 281 million vehicles in operation, as of October 31, 2022. New light-vehicle registration share for EVs reached 5.2% over the first ten months of 2022. With the escalating number of EV nameplates forecast to launch within the decade, the market is poised for rapid growth. EV market share for new vehicles is likely to reach 40% by 2030, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts, at which point the total number of EVs in operation could reach 28.3 million units. Hence the need for rapid development of a charging infrastructure.Story continuesWhile 2030 may seem years off and a problem for tomorrow, development of common standards and deployment of charging stations will take time. But even looking at 2025 – just three years away – there could be as many as 7.8 million electric vehicles in operation (VIO) in the United States, McIlravey said.To support that vehicle population, we expect there will need to be about 700,000 Level 2 and 70,000 Level 3 chargers deployed, including both public and restricted-use facilities. By 2027, we expect there will be a need for about 1.2 million Level 2 chargers and 109,000 Level 3 chargers deployed nationally. Looking further to 2030, with the assumption of 28.3 million units EVs on US roads, an estimated total of 2.13 million Level 2 and 172,000 Level 3 public chargers will be required – all in addition to the units that consumers put in their own garages.S&amp;P Global Mobility EV charger forecastThese national figures are illustrative of the direction needed, but we also expect demand across the United States to develop in a lopsided manner, especially in states where EV adoption is already comparatively strong. Currently, 35 states have signed on for federal assistance under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, of which $7.5 billion is earmarked for EV charging infrastructure. President Biden has pledged that the government will fund the installation of 500,000 charging stations – but that is just a starting point.Noted McIlravey: ""In states following the California Air Resources Board's path to zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) sales, the faster growth of consumer demand will push private investment and more rapid charging infrastructure deployment. However, in states where EV adoption happens gradually, charging station deployment will not need to happen as rapidly and may also need a bit of a push.""In slower-to-adopt states, development of EV charging infrastructure may be more dependent on the spark of public-private investment to lead development of an EV charging infrastructure slightly ahead of full need.The four U.S. states with the highest number of vehicles in operation and highest new-vehicle registrations traditionally are California, Florida, Texas and New York. California, which embraced EVs early, is the state pushing for the most significant emissions restrictions. As such, it is the largest EV market, with about 36.9% of total EVs in operation and 35.8% of total US light-vehicle EV registrations from January through September 2022.Florida is in second place, but with only 7.4% of light-vehicle EV registrations and 6.9% of EV VIO. Texas is not significantly further behind Florida, with 5.8% of VIO and 6.4% of EV state-level light-vehicle registrations.However, neither Florida nor Texas have participated significantly in the emissions discussion nor followed California's lead like the ""CARB states"" mostly in the northeastern and northwestern United States. As a result, the size of these markets – rather than adoption rates – is the main reason Florida and Texas rank highly in EV share of new vehicle registrations and VIO.These are also states which have weather largely favorable to EV operation. As EV adoption grows in the United States, the power of ZEV states remains important to EV growth, but there is little doubt we will see the necessary investment in these markets given the top-down (government) and bottom-up (consumers and charging network operators) support for development in order for the United States to achieve its target for EV adoption. But consumers in the large markets outside the ZEV states will need to be supported with sufficient public charging infrastructure.S&amp;P Global Mobility Level 2 EV charger forecast, top US EV marketsTexas currently has about 5,600 Level 2 non-Tesla and 900 Level 3 chargers, but by 2027 S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts that the state will need about 87,500 Level 2 and 7,800 level 3 chargers to support an expected the expected 1.1 million EV VIO at that time.Meanwhile, Florida currently has about 5,600 Level 2 non-Tesla chargers and 955 Level 3 chargers, but is expected to have 1.06 million EV VIO potential in 2027. To support these vehicles, S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts that Florida will need to grow its charging infrastructure to about 77,000 Level 2 and 6,800 Level 3 charging stations.There also remains lower investment into charging systems outside of major metro markets. Though EV adoption in those areas will continue to be slower, creating a robust infrastructure is important there as well. Currently, 85% of Level 3 chargers are in US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs as defined by the US Census Bureau, and including 384 metro areas); 89% of Level 2 chargers are in these areas. For Tesla owners, 82% of its Superchargers and 83% of its destination chargers are in MSAs.""The focus on urban areas follows where EVs are today, but distribution will need to be much wider as vehicles in operation grow, and consumers need to charge along their routes,"" McIlravey said.Some industry pundits look to the gasoline service station as a comparable model to electric vehicle recharging. But as at-home recharging is in most cases the easiest solution to integrate an EV into daily life, a robust charging infrastructure will look much different from the network of gas stations that has evolved to support the internal combustion engine.The technology behind EV chargers, battery management systems, and battery technologies are leading to faster charge times for DC or Level 3 scenarios, which in turn can impact the locations of charging stations.There also are evolving solutions capable of changing the model. Battery swapping, wireless charging, and increased deployment of DC wallbox solutions at home are three solutions which still can change the landscape. In China, the practice of battery swapping is growing and has had some success, though it has seen virtually no application in Europe beyond the first NIO stations in Norway, and not yet really tested (nor expected) in the US market.""There's the propensity for home charging, the lack of governmental directive, and the need to homogenize battery packs – which would see OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers surrender some of their intellectual property – holding back a technology like battery swapping,"" said Graham Evans, S&amp;P Global Mobility research and analysis director.Of wireless charging, Evans says that widespread adoption of the technology has the potential to challenge the current stand-off between battery size and range. Evans says consumers will be able to charge more conveniently at home and adopt 'splash and dash' behaviors if dynamic wireless charging becomes widespread. However, the cost of wireless charging may be an issue, and mainstream consumers may not be interested in paying a premium for wireless charging, Evans cautioned. Plug-in technology was first to market as well as being less expensive, which leaves deployment of wireless charging to play catch up regardless of whether it might be superior in terms of convenience.The third technology with potential to shake up our existing assumptions are at-home DC wallbox solutions. According to Evans, they offer a halfway solution between slow AC chargers and the superfast public DC chargers. Wider deployment of these solutions has potential to shift the balance in the domestic versus public charging conundrum. Furthermore, there are models available that facilitate V2G (vehicle to grid) operation, which has potential to change the conversation by allowing EVs to effectively become part of our electric grid system and leading to some financial return for participating consumers.As the US vehicle market transitions from internal combustion to battery electric, the refueling mechanism is transitioning with it.""For mass-market acceptance of BEVs to take hold, the recharging infrastructure must do more than keep pace with EV sales,"" Evans said. ""It must surprise and delight vehicle owners who will be new to electrification, so that the process seems seamless and perhaps even more convenient than their experience with gasoline refueling, with minimal compromise on the vehicle ownership experience. Developments in battery technology, and how quickly EVs can receive power, will be as critical to improvements here as how quickly and plentifully infrastructure can provide the power.""About S&amp;P Global Mobility (www.spglobal.com/mobility)At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

Apple had been previously expected to replace the Qualcomm part as soon as this year, but development snags have pushed back the timeline.Apple is Broadcom’s largest customer and accounted for about 20% of the chipmaker’s revenue in the last fiscal year, amounting to almost $7 billion. Qualcomm got 22% of its annual sales from the iPhone maker, representing nearly $10 billion, though that company has warned for years that its Apple reliance will wane.Shares of Broadcom fell as much as 4.7% on the news before paring their decline. The shares closed at $576.89, down 2%. Qualcomm slid as much as 1.6% before closing at $114.61, down 0.6%. Apple rose 0.4% to $130.15.The moves will further upend a chip industry that makes billions of dollars supplying Apple components. Already, the world’s most valuable tech company has removed most Intel Corp. processors from its Mac computers, opting instead to use in-house chips known as Apple Silicon. Now the changes are hitting the biggest makers of wireless electronics.The iPhone is Apple’s top moneymaker, generating more than half of its $394.3 billion in revenue last year. The phone also has helped fuel growth at Broadcom, which refers to Apple as its “large North American customer” during earnings calls. The chipmaker makes a combined component that handles both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functions on Apple devices.Story continuesApple is developing an in-house replacement for that chip and is aiming to start using it in its devices in 2025, the people said. In addition, it’s already working on a follow-up version that will combine cellular modem, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities into a single component.A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment. Broadcom didn’t have an immediate comment.Broadcom still supplies Apple with other components — including radio-frequency chips and ones that handle wireless charging — though the iPhone maker has been working on customizing those parts as well.During a conference call last month, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan expressed confidence that his company will maintain its foothold at Apple.“We believe we have the best technology and delivering value to our customers,” he said. “There’s no reason to find something else where you’re not the best.”Qualcomm declined to comment beyond pointing to previous remarks that the company has made on the topic.In November, the chipmaker said it expected to supply the vast majority of modems for the 2023 iPhone launch, up from a previous assumption of just 20%. “Beyond this, there are no changes to our planning assumption, and we are assuming minimal contribution from Apple product revenues in fiscal ’25,” Qualcomm said.With the shift away from Qualcomm modems, Apple plans to initially just use its homegrown component in one new product, such as a high-end iPhone model. It will then gradually move away from Qualcomm modems during a period it anticipates will take about three years — similar to how it handled past transitions.But the swap hasn’t been easy so far. After aiming to launch its own cellular modem by this year, the company faced problems with overheating, battery life and getting the component validated. The iPhone currently works with more than 100 wireless carriers in over 175 countries, which necessities a lengthy and cumbersome testing process.A cellular modem is what allows iPhones to handle phone calls and connect to the internet while away from Wi-Fi, making it the most critical part of the device for most people. If Apple’s offering is inferior to Qualcomm’s component, it could put the company’s flagship product at a significant disadvantage.The long transition also could put Apple in a tricky position. The company will still need to rely on Qualcomm for several years as it replaces the component in various devices.Apple first started work on its modem around 2018, opening an office in San Diego near Qualcomm’s headquarters. To speed up development, the company acquired Intel’s modem unit in 2019 for $1 billion and opened additional offices in key areas known for wireless technology development.The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip effort is newer, and a release will take longer. But Apple has already made some wireless chips in the past, including the H2 processor found in AirPods and the W3 chip found in Apple Watches.Apple and Qualcomm were embroiled in a legal war over royalties and patents related to modems until a settlement in 2019. At the time, Apple deemed the truce necessary to bring 5G support to the iPhone in 2020. The companies agreed that Qualcomm would supply parts to Apple through 2024.Apple also has had a strained relationship with Broadcom. Tan, the chipmaker’s CEO, has a reputation for tough negotiations and forced some customers to commit to noncancelable orders during the pandemic-fueled supply crunch.In 2020, Apple said it was spending a total of $15 billion on purchases of Broadcom chips in an arrangement running through the middle of 2023. But despite Apple being Broadcom’s top customer, Tan’s commitment to the market has occasionally wavered. Prior to the 2020 agreement, Tan indicated that Broadcom might divest the business that supplies chips to Apple.For Broadcom investors, Apple’s next steps are another thing to worry about, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. analyst Aaron Rakers said in a report.“While it is well-known that Apple continues to move toward internally designing an increasing number of its components, from a Broadcom perspective, this likely creates an investor sentiment headwind given how significant Apple’s revenue contribution is,” he said.--With assistance from Ian King.(Updates with Qualcomm comment in 13th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAirlines Resurrect Ancient Jumbo Jets to Meet First- and Business-Class DemandUsed-Car Prices Are Finally DroppingAmerica’s Homes Are Already Transforming Into Mini Power PlantsYoung Bankers Who Got Used to Smooth Sailing Prepare for a StormAmerica’s Aggressive Chip Strategy Forces China Into a Corner©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at PulteGroup's (NYSE:PHM) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for PulteGroup:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$14b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, PulteGroup has an ROCE of 28%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for PulteGroup roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PulteGroup compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PulteGroup.How Are Returns Trending?We like the trends that we're seeing from PulteGroup. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 28%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 47% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.In Conclusion...In summary, it's great to see that PulteGroup can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 50% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing PulteGroup that you might find interesting.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

These strategic initiatives will also help the company to improve long-term performance, accelerate innovation and create additional value for all stakeholders. These strategic plans include the spin-off of its Renal Care and Acute Therapies global business units into an independent, publicly traded company; simplification of its commercial and manufacturing footprint that will enhance underlying business performance; and portfolio actions to improve Baxter's capital structure.Standalone Kidney CareBaxter is a leader in the global kidney care industry with a legacy of more than seven decades. It serves more than one million patients annually in over 70 countries. The company is planning to spin-off the business into a separate entity. Management expects the spinoff to qualify as tax-free for Baxter and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purpose, and to be completed in 12 to 18 months.Renal Care is the biggest division of Baxter’s businesses by sales, accounting for about 25% of third-quarter revenues. Renal Care is being spun off with a smaller business, Acute Therapies, which brought in about 4% of sales in the quarter.The company believes that the spin off of Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses into an independent company will help it focus on its own investment priorities. Enhanced management focus will likely lead to better growth opportunities and investments for innovation. As a standalone unit, it is likely to be better-equipped and focused to deliver robust service capabilities that will support its therapies delivered in homes, clinics, and Intensive Care Units across the globe.Following the separation, the standalone business will target market segments worth approximately $15 billion. These segments are likely to grow between 3% to 4% every year on average for the next three years, suggesting growth opportunities to continue. Baxter’s Renal Care and Acute Therapies global businesses recorded total revenues of approximately $5 billion globally in 2021.Story continuesBaxter International Inc. PriceBaxter International Inc. PriceBaxter International Inc. price | Baxter International Inc. QuoteOther InitiativesBaxter also announced that it is working on a new operating model that will be implemented parallelly with the spin-off actions. This new model is likely to help the company in becoming a more integrated and nimble organization that can respond to changes in the environment quickly and more effectively. It will also help in enhancing Baxter’s ability to advance innovation for its patients. The company looks to provide an update on its new operating model plans on its next earnings call scheduled on Feb 9.Following the reorganization and the proposed spin-off, the existing businesses of the company are likely to target market segments worth more than $100 billion. These market segments, together, are likely to grow by approximately 3% every year for the next three years.As part of its strategic actions, Baxter is also pursuing strategic alternatives for its BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business, which includes a potential sale or other separation options. Although the BPS business has continued opportunities for growth, the business model and client focus have limited strategic alignment with the rest of Baxter's portfolio. The divestment of this business segment will help the company streamline its focus and provide an opportunity for capital redeployment in accordance with its stated capital allocation priorities, including debt repayment.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderBaxter currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks to consider from the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

178,c42bbd92-0921-3471-89b3-c8ecac962fbf,JNJ,2023-01-10,15 Companies That Still Test on Animals in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-companies-still-test-animals-014537588.html,1673315137,STORY,"['PG', 'JNJ', 'CHD', 'UL', 'MMM', 'URBN', 'CL']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 companies that still test on animals in 2022. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 companies that still test on animals in 2022.There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the use of animals in testing, particularly for products such as cosmetics and household cleaning products. Some people argue that testing on animals is necessary in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these products, while others argue that it is unethical to subject animals to such testing, and that alternative methods should be used instead.Many companies test on animals to ensure that their products are safe for human use. Before products are sold to the general public, companies need to ensure that their cosmetics are both properly labelled and safe. In the U.S., this is regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. While the act doesn't tell companies to use animals for testing their products, it is often the only natural conclusion to fulfil the requirements of the Act. Hence, animal testing is used by these companies to ensure that their products can be used or consumed by humans.This is an issue for companies in various industries, including cosmetics, pharmaceutical and medical research laboratories. Various products be it makeup items, medicine and shampoos to surgical procedures are first tested on animals. While this may seem necessary, it is important to note that this often falls under animal cruelty, due to the effects of this testing on animals. According to the Humane Society International, more than 115 million animals are used in testing every single year worldwide. Even if these tests are classified as ""mild"", there is a strong chance that animals are likely to face not just physical but mental distress and suffering, while some of the harsher treatments can cause irreparable damage. Many animals are often even killed at the end of experiments.Story continues15 companies that still test on animals in 2022Kingcraft/Shutterstock.comWhile many people may argue that animal testing is necessary and people are being overly sensitive, you might change your mind if you knew about some of the experiments that are conducted, such as forced chemical exposure to determine toxicity testing including forced-feeding, exposure to drugs or chemicals which can result in severe physical harm and even death, manipulation of genes, infliction of wounds, infliction of pain and even behavioral experiments. In plain words, this is pure torture of animals which is illegal in every way, except when companies are able to lobby and get exemptions.Nowadays, investors don't just want to learn about the financial performance of a company, but also their contribution to society, which is where the term ESG comes in. ESG refers to environmental, society and governance and focuses on the non-financial contributions of a company. Many organizations are now lobbying for avoiding investing in companies which test products on animals, because that is the only way that companies will consider minimizing or completely eliminating animal testing. Such organizations include PETA, which states that ""cruelty-free investing means investing in companies, mutual funds, bonds, and other investment vehicles that do not support, cause, or contribute to animal exploitation and suffering, including the destruction of natural habitats.""PETA even maintains an exhaustive database which shows companies which test on animals, making it easier for potential investors to avoid such companies. Some examples of companies which have focused on non-animal testing include Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). One of the largest FMCG companies in the world, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has been implementing non-animal testing for decades now. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) also consistently publishes its work in this regard and collaborates with others to ensure that everyone is able to implement similar practices. The company has also been involved in working on regulatory changes that will lead to a decline in animal testing, and some of its brands have been certified by PETA as well. The company has also been involved in calling for a global ban on animal testing by 2023, as some of its products still have to be tested on animals to comply with local regulations, while it has maintained its stance that such testing is not necessary.Some states in the U.S. have also started to implement tougher regulations in this respect, and in 2022, the state of New York banned cosmetics animal testing which is the 10th such state in the country to do this. Worldwide, there are now 42 national bans in addition to 12 states banning the practice in Brazil.All of this is possible due to improvements in technology, which have made non-animal testing a real possibility. These technologies include a combination of 3D printing, robotics, computer models, microengineering and human cell, organs and tissues. There are several companies which are leading the way here, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), one of the largest healthcare companies by market cap, which purchased Advanced Bioprocessing for $477 million in 2018. With bans on animal testing increasing, and governments providing support to companies which are working on non-animal testing, this industry could see stratospheric growth and investing in it now might be a very viable possibility.Of course, many other companies have continued to test on animals despite the backlash. Recently, Neuralink, owned by everyone's favorite villain in Elon Musk, has been in the news for an investigation regarding its animal testing practices after allegations that more than 1,000 animals were killed by the company during rushed brain chip experiments. This should come as no surprise for a company owned by a person who considers laws and regulations as suggestions and believes money to be above everything else. There are many other such companies as well, which we'll mention below. Our list has been devised from PETA's directory which maintains extensive records regarding animal testing. So let's take a look at the companies that may end up on the wrong side of history if they don't change their ways, starting with number 15:15.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)While PETA lists Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) as “working toward regulatory changes to reduce the number of animals used for testing”, this does not mean that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is cruelty-free.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America.According to McKinsey, since April 2021, over 19 million US workers have left their jobs. This record-breaking rate has caused business disruption across the world. Around 53% of employers have reported observing significantly high labor turnover compared to previous years, and 64% anticipate the issue to worsen in the coming months. Companies are now actively working towards identifying challenges and establishing progressive workplace practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the evolution of the workplace culture due to lockdowns and restrictions of movement across the world. There has been increased focus on diversity and inclusion at workplaces across the US.A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that motivate employees to reach their full potential. As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diversity—through the lenses of color, gender, skill, and sexual orientation — can serve to build companies. According to McKinsey’s “Diversity Wins” report, the possibility of outperformance increases with the level of gender diversity. For instance, businesses that have more than 30% female executives do better than those that have between 10% and 30% female executives. Companies with the highest levels of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts.A sense of inclusiveness has a strong relationship with employee engagement. People who have a strong sense of inclusion are more likely than others to express enthusiasm for and dedication to their organizations. McKinsey’s research revealed that a perceived lack of inclusiveness at a company led over 40% of respondents to decline or decide against applying for a job. Progressive workplaces such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are replacing the conventional workplace model where employees work on a clock and managers enforce strict rules and regulations without any room for open communication.Story continuesPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have referred to renowned publications and websites such as Forbes, Fortune 100, and Top Workplaces to shortlist the 15 most progressive companies in America. We have used 8 articles to report the consensus picks of established publications. These companies have been ranked in ascending order in terms of the number of sources that have termed them progressive.15 Most Progressive Companies in America15. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a Mayfield, Ohio-based insurance company. It is the third biggest insurance carrier in the US, with a presence in over 50 states. Furthermore, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is also the largest US automobile insurance provider, with a headcount of 51,431 employees as of 2022.The company has the distinction of filling up 80% of jobs above entry-level positions by promoting its talent internally. This reflects the entity’s focus on promoting internal growth opportunities for its employees. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also conducts a Multicultural Leadership Development Program for its employees. Over 60% of the program graduates are promoted to higher positions. According to “Great Place to Work,” 96% of employees think that the corporation makes them feel welcome at their initiation.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Progressive Corp had a positive contribution to performance during the quarter. Net Premiums Written (NPW) grew +12% as the Company grew both policies in force and took rate to offset higher loss cost trends that are being driven by inflation. For example, we estimate accident severity for personal auto are up +35% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, this is partially offset by a 20% decline in frequency, due to people driving fewer miles. Progressive is making up for this net rise in cost by raising policy rates in the mid-teens percentage range. Progressive has been relatively early to take rate compared to industry peers, so the Company should be able to aggressively compete for share as competitors play catchup.”14. Fidelity InvestmentsNumber of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2Fidelity Investments is a Boston, Massachusetts-based privately held financial services firm that provides financial planning solutions and advice related to retirement planning, wealth management, investing, trading, and brokerage services.Fidelity Investments is ranked 27 among the best employers for diversity by Forbes. The company provides its customers with the option of sustainable investing, as two-thirds of investors think that social impact is integral in determining where to invest. Abigail Johnson has led Fidelity Investments as President and CEO of the company since 2014. According to Great Place to Work, 88% of employees at Fidelity Investment think the company provides a conducive environment for personal growth. The company also scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index last year.13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports online money transfers worldwide.Leading publication Forbes has ranked the company 20th on its list of employers known for promoting diversity in the US. Furthermore, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands 45th among the world’s best employers and holds the 123rd place among the world’s top female-friendly organizations. According to GlobalData, the company has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce. Meanwhile, 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics and Latinx, and African Americans. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also have programs related to parental preparedness and Global Wellness Days to ensure employees’ well-being.Wedgewood Partners shared its outlook on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based creative, marketing, and document management software corporation.In terms of gender representation, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) claims to have 33.6% female employees in its workforce of 25,000 employees. Women occupy 27.2% of the leadership positions in the company. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is targeting the proportion to increase to 30% by 2025 and eventually achieve gender parity. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has brought in Brian Miller as the Chief Talent, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer to ensure the company meets its strategic goals. Every year since 2001, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recognized 12 employees with Adobe’s Founder Award to honor the brightest in the company through a peer-to-peer system.Here’s what Renaissance Investment Management said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the quarter. The company reported decelerating revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but more concerning was the announced acquisition of privately held Figma for a record $20 billion. While management made a compelling case for the acquisition, the price paid revived fears that Adobe is facing increasing competitive threats.”11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) customer relationship management (CRM) company.Back in 2019, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) aimed to have half of its workforce represent minority groups. The company managed to achieve this target one year earlier, as 50.7% of its employees today belong to underrepresented groups. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) intends to connect executive compensation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals to increase accountability. Progressive initiatives at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are led by Lori Castillo Martinez as the Chief Equality Officer. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has been undertaking progressive measures for a number of years now. In 2015, the company conducted an equal pay audit that resulted in a salary adjustment of $3 million.Oakmark Funds shared its outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Rogers, Arkansas-based operator of the discount department, grocery stores, and hypermarkets. The company is the biggest retailer in the world, with a headcount of over 1.6 million employees in the US alone across its 4,000 stores.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is actively making efforts to promote a progressive work culture. As of 2022, 53% of all the company’s associates in the US are women. Meanwhile, 21% of its associates are Blacks or African American. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has also launched a progressive wage structure for its pharmacy technicians to increase their hourly wage by $4 over the course of four years. In June 2022, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) increased the average hourly wage of its 36,000 pharmacy technicians to $20 per hour.Leaven Partners shared its stance on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”9. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based operator, franchisor, and licensor of lodging services comprising hotel, residential and timeshare properties.Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) launched a $50 million development program in June 2022 focused on addressing challenges related to the underrepresentation of minorities in developing and owning hotels in the North American region. The company intends to create an expected asset value of $1 billion through the development program. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has had a diversity and inclusion program for more than two decades. The company claims to have 54% of female employees in its workforce. Overall, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) intends to have 3,000 diverse-owned hotels in its portfolio by 2025.Here’s what LRT Capital Management said about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its October investor letter:“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is the world’s largest hotel company followed closely by Hilton (HLT) and Intercontinental Hotels Group plc (IHG). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Aloft), through the mid-tier (Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels), to the luxury high end (JW Marriot, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis). In total the company had 7,642 properties with over 1.4 million rooms as of the end of Q1 2021.The majority (85%) of Marriott’s revenue comes from hotels in the United States, with the rest almost evenly split between Asia Pacific and Europe. Like it’s smaller peer, Hilton, the company today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels, not a hotel owner. The company owns 66 hotels, manages 2,083 and franchises 5,493. Like all franchise-based businesses Marriott requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Marriott currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However, the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure (the company acquired Starwood Properties in late 2016) – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid, as we expect it will, the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based payment card company.As of 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has invested $1 billion in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. The company intends to spend an additional $3 billion by 2025 to promote these initiatives. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the US for the last two consecutive years. Forbes has ranked American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the 61st position in the list of employees known for promoting diversity. In March 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) also launched its Amex Flex working system to allow employees to work either in an office or virtually. Under this initiative, 40% of employees have decided to go completely virtual.7. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a McLean, Virginia-based hospitality company with a wide variety of hotels and resorts in its portfolio.According to Great Place to Work, the company has been regarded as the best organization for diversity and parents. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) provides benefits like adoption assistance, parental leave, and GED support to its associates at its properties. The company intends to achieve equal representation of both genders in leadership positions globally by 2027 and have 25% ethnic diversity in leadership roles across the US. Furthermore, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has partnered with the Atlanta, Georgia-based Morris Brown College to create a sustainable relationship with college students by establishing a $30 million hotel and hospitality training center.Here’s what Pershing Square Holdings said about Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential, led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel, with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows, and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight, Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model, and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant, results have vastly improved throughout the year as COVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus, and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months, Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services. …” (Click here to read the full text)6. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 5Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a Dublin, Ireland-based Irish-American IT services company.Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) assesses pay-equity every year. As of November 5, 2021, the company had achieved dollar-for-dollar pay equity for male and female employees across every market in which it operates.

Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at scatter plot of all of Distillate’s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with valuation on the vertical axis and free cash ϲow stability on the horizontal axis.”In addition to Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc.

184,26a55194-cf63-395d-8758-7ddf7ea01018,MRK,2023-01-10,5 Top Pharma Stocks of 2022 to Buy for the Long Haul,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-pharma-stocks-2022-232624244.html,1673047584,STORY,"['REGN', 'LLY', 'AMGN', 'BMY', 'MRK']","[Not every stock went down in 2022. Shares in some the biggest pharmaceutical companies rose in price. If you can make it in a market like 2022, imagine what can happen in 2023 for many top pharma stocks.What the best pharma stocks have in common is pricing power, patented medicines, big moats and wide margins. They’re also members of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group that has fought for decades to keep prices high.Pricing is the key risk for these companies. The Inflation Reduction Act lets Medicare negotiate on prices for the first time. The Biden Administration is already touting a $35/month cap on insulin prices under the law.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut that could just be the start. If drugs cost less under Medicare than with private insurance, patients and plans may demand to be let in on the savings. The government will push drugmakers to compete on price, squeezing margins. Insurers may join them.That said, this trade group has dramatically weakened the final bill. It still has enormous power, before courts, legislators and regulators, even manipulating public opinion directly.The bottom line is that the law will be less-effective than advertised, at least in 2023, with many provisions failing to take effect for years. Thus, the industry has time to adapt, giving investors time to load up on thee top pharma stocks.MRKMerck$113.82LLYEli Lilly$360.18AMGNAmgen$267.83BMYBristol-Myers Squibb$72.33REGNRegeneron Pharmaceuticals$728.36Merck (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) had a spectacular 2022, with its stock rising 44% as the average stock in the S&amp;P 500 fell almost 20%. This brought the market cap of one of the top pharma stocks in the market to $280 billion in early 2023.Merck is best known for Keytruda, its anti-cancer immunosuppressant. But there’s a lot more to like, according to analysts. It has a COVID-19 pill called Lagevrio. It is also working with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) on a cancer vaccine. To keep growth going, it is buying Imago Biosciences (NASDAQ:IMGO), which is working on blood diseases. Thus, this is one of the top pharma stocks making waves in many areas of the market.Story continuesIn 2022 Merck saw record sales, higher profits, and promising results in clinical trials. Sotatercept, its hypertension drug acquired with Acceleron in 2021 for $11.5 billion, met the main goal on its latest clinical trial. The company’s early bet on using peptides to help otherwise-toxic drugs reach their targets is paying off.Merck remains a conservative investment. Its 73 cent per share dividend still yields 2.6%. Its price-earnings ratio of 18-times is not out of line, given 20% top-line growth and 17% profit growth. It even managed a successful CEO transition to Robert Davis.Technicians like Merck’s chart pattern and none of the 16 analysts following Merck at Tipranks want you to sell it, even at $110/share. In fact, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) recently raised its price target to $125/share.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock had a stellar 2022, rising nearly 33%. Its market cap entering January was about $347 billion. The company has a large lead in treating diabetes that is leading to breakthroughs in weight loss.Lilly may look overvalued with a price-earnings multiple of 55-times, and a 2022 growth rate of under 10%. That said, its best seller right now is Trulicity, a diabetes treatment that brought in nearly $6.5 billion last year. Past hits include Prozac for depression, Zyprexa for psychosis, and Humulin, a bio-engineered form of insulin. It is also delivering a long-acting insulin called Rezvoglar, which would be interchangeable with Sanofi’s (NYSE:SNY) Lantus. This could drive down the cost of diabetes care.But Lilly’s future looks even better than its past. Mounjaro, originally created for diabetes as tirzepatide, may find new sales as an obesity treatment. This would make it what our Louis Navillier calls a “mega blockbuster.” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) thinks Mounjaro could ring up sales of $50 billion. That’s more than Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) COVID vaccine, Comirnaty.Lilly is already expanding its manufacturing capacity in expectation of a quick approval. Lilly has another drug called retatrutide, about to go into Phase 3 testing, that could be even more effective. The drug works by mimicking a hormone that drives hunger, and by causing food to clear from the stomach more slowly.Small wonder that 11 of 13 analysts at Tipranks want you to buy LLY stock, with a price target of $400, 10% above its current level.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock managed to gain 17% in 2022, while the average S&amp;P stock lost 20%. This is among the most valuable pharma stocks out there, with a market cap of approximately $139 billion, a price-earnings ratio 21-times, and a fat dividend yield of 3.2%Amgen’s best seller, Enbrel, is an anti-cancer drug that had $6 billion of sales in a single year. It also sells Prolia, a shot for strengthening bones, an auto-immune drug called Otezla for psoriasis and arthritis, and an osteoporosis treatment called Xgeva. All are doing better than expected, and I expect Amgen to remain among the top pharma stocks for some time to come.But the real excitement surrounds the pending purchase of Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP) for nearly $28 billion. Horizon makes drugs for rare autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Its best known drug is Tepezza, used to treat thyroid eye disease.Each of Horizon’s drugs may have relatively modest sales. Tepezza had less than $500 million last year. But rare disease drugs have an easier time winning approval, and pricing is seldom an issue. To some analysts, this makes investing in Amgen a “no-brainer.” They point to the $11.7 billion it had in cash at the end of September, and operating cash flow of over $9 billion, which makes its acquisitions affordable.This view is not universal, however. Bears point to $37 billion in long-term debt even before the Horizon purchase, which came after Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) both expressed interest. Four of the company’s 16 analysts at Tipranks are telling clients to sell it.Amgen could also get a boost if it wins its effort to revive patents on its biologic Repatha, and block the sale of competing drugs from Sanofi and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The issue is how narrowly patents must be written and how different competing drugs must be to avoid violating them.Bristol-Myers (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock had a solid 2022, up over 16%. The company also hiked its dividend in December to 57 cents, meaning it now yields over 3.1%.The company’s best-selling drugs are Revlimid for multiple myeloma, Eliquis, a blood thinner, and Opdivo, which competes with Merck’s Keytruda as an anti-cancer immunosuppressant. All three, however, go off-patent later this decade.The company bought Celgene (makers of Revlimid) for $74 billion in 2019, which kept the stock’s performance down until 2022. The year was helped by $15 billion in stock buybacks to support the stock price. By September, the company still had $9.1 billion in cash and equivalents on its books.BMY got good news from regulators in 2022, who approved three new Bristol-Myers drugs, the most from any maker. These include a melanoma drug called Opdualag, which will help extend the patent life of Opdivo, Camzyos for a genetic heart disease that thickens the muscle and slows blood flow, and Sotyktu, an oral drug for severe psoriasis to compete with Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) Humira. Each are expected to become a $4 billion franchise over time.Some analysts are worried about expiring patents and slowing approvals, turning negative on Bristol-Myers. Most of the 11 following it are in the hold camp, with three saying buy and one saying sell.Regeneron (REGN)The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of top pharma stock to buy is Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The company had a decent 2022, with REGN stock rising about 15%. This brought the company’s market cap to $78.5 billion, despite it having no dividend. Regeneron’s price-earnings ratio is 15-times.I have long been a fan of Regeneron thanks to their VelociSuite, which models what potential drugs might do on mice. I think having a system for drug discovery delivers more long-term value than just having a hit drug.While Regeneron is losing patent protection on Eylea, which fights macular degeneration, it has new blockbusters in Dupixent, an autoimmune drug, and Libtayo, which competes with Merck’s Keytruda.Regeneron was thought to be a COVID play in 2021 with its REGN-COV, but a cut in government funding recently caused it to cut four clinical trials of the drug. It also recently dropped work on medicines for chronic pain and cat allergies. One area where Regeneron is not cutting back is on obesity, where it’s working with a gene called GPR75 that can protect people from getting fat. It is trying three different methods for developing a drug in this area.Research cutbacks led to a bad third quarter, with sales and profits both down from a year earlier. This led analysts to downgrade their outlook on Regeneron stock. At Tipranks, only 7 of 13 want you to buy it, and 1 is telling clients to sell.While Regneron may look down now, I still think it’s the best of the five pharma stock studied here for the long term.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in MRNA and BAC.

(NYSE:PKE) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 6, 2023Operator: Good morning. My name is Doug, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Park Aerospace Corp. Third Quarter Fiscal Year '23 Earnings Release Conference Call and Investor Presentation . At this time, I would like to turn today's call over to Mr. Brian Shore, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shore, you may begin your conference.Brian Shore: Thank you, operator. This is Brian. Welcome everybody to our third quarter conference call. Happy New Year. With me, as usual, as always, Matt Farabaugh, our CFO. So we announced our earnings this morning. In the earnings announcement there also are instructions as how to access the presentation, either view our webcast or through our website, you want to have that up in front of you to make the call more meaningful of course. Just one note, I don't want you to freak out too much about the length of the presentation. I think it's like 55 slides. But what we did is we incorporated a number of slides from the prior presentation, Q2 and even Q1 for context and perspective. So the third quarter presentation stands on its own.You have to go back and start, check in the second quarter or first quarter presentation to get the full picture. But those items that we just -- that we carried over, pretty much intact. We'll probably skip over at least skim over. So it's a lot of slides, but I think we'll be able to move through it relatively quickly. And when I say that, it's probably 45 minutes, but it's not going to -- we're not going to go through every slide to cover that. So of course, when we're done going to go through the presentation, Matt and I will be happy to answer your questions. And I think that's it. So why don't we get started. Here we go. So let's move on to Slide 2, our forward-looking disclaimer language. If you have any questions about that language, please let us know.Story continuesAerospaceSlide 3 is our table content. The presentation that we're about to go through and then the supplementary financial information, that's Appendix 1. We're not going to go through that either during the presentation. But if you have questions about it, please let us know, of course. Slide 4, we will slowdown a little bit for Slide 4. This is the earnings results, at least high level. If you look at the right-hand column, these are quarterly results, of course. And highlighted in yellow, we have Q3 sales, $13.867 million. Gross profit, easy number to remember, $4.444 million. Gross margin, 32%, which we like to be higher. But as we always said, we get real unhappy when it gets going below 30%. If you look at Q2, it actually did go below 30%. And we have a couple of quarters where it's gone below 30%.Now you go back to the fiscal year '21 and that was the beginning of pandemic. So we know a number of quarters where the margins were lower. So adjusted EBITDA, $3.321 million, EBITDA percentage 29.3% . What do we say about Q2, during our sorry -- what did we say about Q3, the current quarter during our Q2 investor call, what did we say about it? We said our sales estimate was $13.25 million to $13.75 million. So we came in just a little tad above the top of the range there. And then our adjusted EBITDA estimate $3 million to $3.5 million. The adjusted EBITDA, as I said is $3.321 million, so kind of in the middle of the range for EBITDA. I'll just remind you briefly about our forecast philosophy. We tend to kind of remind you almost every quarter our forecast philosophy, when we give you a forecast, we're saying to you, this is what we think will happen.We don't play what we consider to be a game of giving you a low number that we can beat and then be heroes. That's not what we're doing. And our employees, they have the same targets. So these are real objectives for us. And they're not easy objectives. These are again, we're telling you what we think will happen, assuming that we do what we normally do, is work very hard to make the numbers. So I just want to mention that to you. So when we make our numbers, the fact that we gave you a number that was in our forecast, the prior quarter that was low, so it was beat to call, I guess in Wall Street. That's not something -- we think it's just kind of a waste of your time and our time to play that game. The other thing is that we have -- when people do that, I know most people do, to us they're not really being honest with you.They tell you this is what they think is going to happen. They don't really believe it. And that's not for us. So we're not judging others. We're just telling you, reminding you of our philosophy. Let's go on to Slide 5. An outstanding job by Park's people to exceed by just a little bit our Q3 sales estimate and to make our Q3 EBITDA estimate, especially considering significant challenges with supply chain disruptions, freight disruptions, unreliability, staffing shortages. It was not easy to make those numbers. And total missed shipments in Q3, approximately $650,000. We're still struggling with these things. Those three checked items are the reason for the missed shipments in Q3 that hopefully will carry over to Q4. Factors which affected our margins in Q3.So we're going to go into the next page, is a bunch of factors, a number of factors we'll be talking about. So far, we're talking about top line in terms of how much we -- the $650,000 we missed top line. Now let's talk about bottom line. Let's go on to Slide 6. Significant inflation. That's not going away or abated yet, not for us anyway. Raw material costs, shipping supplies, other supplies, utilities, freight in, freight out, people costs, you name it, probably more expensive. Some of the increased costs were passed through to our customers in Q3 and form of selling price increases, but not all. Why is that? First item is the lag effect. And so we honor our commitments on our POs. Some companies don't do that. Some of our suppliers surprisingly haven't done that.We're going to confirm PO and then we're going to go ahead and confirm that PO with our customer based upon the expectation of raw material costs. And in the middle of the process, we are told that our cost is going up, even though there's a PO that we have from our supplier. So we get burned with that. But we don't do that. We live up to our commitment -- it's not even a discussion, it's not a great area. We make a commitment, we live up to it. So there's a lag effect. So we need to wait until the next time we quote this customer in order to take into account the increased costs. And the other thing is, forget about our suppliers for a second, just the other costs are going up. They haven't gone up very quickly. And people talk about inflation moderating.We don't see that. Sometimes it's hard to keep up. We anticipate a little inflation when we do our quoting, but sometimes it gets away from us. So we get behind the power curve. But we just -- we live up to our commitments. So that's a lag effect. We'll wait until the next time we quote in order to take into account the inflation factors. And then the other factor is LTA pricing with certain customers like that big one MRAS which we talk about a lot of these presentations. We have long-term pricing, fixed pricing. It could be subject to fixed adjustments, but it's not often based upon inflation factors. So that's also an issue. And inflation is really a burden for us. It's really becoming a burden for us. And our people, I think, are doing a pretty special job is finding ways to overcome that burden because there's a real burden.It's not just kind of a rounding error kind of burden. It's a real burden and it's something that we live with every day. And we continue to live with. We are not sure when it's going to go away. Like I said, people say it's moderating. We don't see it in our little world. Let's go on to Slide 7. Still talking about margins, what happened -- not what happened on our margins, but things that impacted our margins, let's put it that way. Somewhat lower margin product mix in Q3 than expected. So why did we not fully anticipate this in our planning? When we gave you a forecast for Q3 back when we did our Q2 announcement, why don't we anticipate the product mix? And my comment is, I think the same comment we gave you last time, planning is interesting in the world of supply chain chaos.So we have a nice plan. It's great. But so we put the plan in the drawer, then the chaos happens because of supply chain disruptions and freight disruptions. Whatever we plan is nice, but it's not what we're able to do. We have to shuffle. We have to move things around. We have to scramble. We have to make things happen. That's the Herculean effort that's involved to make our numbers, to make our quarters because if we just kind of went as planned, they would not work out too well. And then Mike Tyson, everyone who has -- everyone has a plan so they can punch them out. I think it speaks to us, because we have a plan, but almost immediately after the plan is put in the drawer, the world changes on us and a lot. This is not normal. I mean, things always change a little bit, but changed on us a lot.So it's very difficult to anticipate exactly what we're going to sell in any quarter and that's why it is difficult to anticipate the product mix exactly in terms of margins. What we plan is good, but we end up actually selling during the quarter may not be what we planned. And in fact, it has been up in what we planned. Supply chain disruptions continue to cause significant efficiencies in our manufacturing operations. If you know people that run the manufacturing operations, one of the things they really like the best is to be building to plan the manufacturing operation with some kind of predictability. And when you have to scramble and adjust and move things around, it makes the manufacturing operation very inefficient. Again, this is another thing that our people had overcome.They did an outstanding job in my opinion of overcoming it. But at the end of the day, notwithstanding all the obstacles, challenges and difficulties our great Park people pulled together to get the job done to make our Q3 numbers. Each person, each Park person received a quarterly bonus, our Q3 quarterly bonus of $200, not in thousands. They didn't get $200,000, they got $200 for his or her outstanding job under very challenging circumstances. Let's continue to Slide 8. Slide 8, we won't discuss very much, but this is a slide that we provide in our presentations for historical context and reference. Any questions about the annual -- historical annual results, let us know. Let's go on to Slide 9, just to save a little time here. Park's balance sheet, cash, cash dividend history and recent share buyback authorization.We'll skip through some of this stuff. One of our key investors recommended we cover it to me. We cover this every quarter. I thought it was a good idea. So we're doing that. Some of the stuff is not that newsy. It's kind of going over things we covered before. Let's see our reported cash was $103.3 million in Q3. What's our investment philosophy? We invest in highly secure liquid securities, such as treasuries, governments, high-grade commercial paper. We don't take any credit risk. We do take interest rate risk because look our average maturity is 21 months. So interest rates spiking up, you don't have, because that means the value of the investment at least, temporarily ends up going down. Our practice, by the way, is to hold our investment to maturity, but the value of them on accrued basis is going to be depressed if interest rates are going up, which they happen, of course.We report this is how reporting is done mark-to-market. So it's not the investment value, it's the market value of our securities and investments that are reported to you with that $103.3 million. Just so you know, in case I put it that way, the amortized cost basis of our cash and marketable securities as of the end of Q3 was $109.2 million. I just want you to have that information and you figure out, you decide what you think is a more relevant number. If we hold these securities to maturity, which has been our practice, we'd probably get closer to about $109 million. When these securities mature, you got a 21-month average maturity, but the present value of $103.3 million. The other reason I want you to know that is in case you're wondering, what happen to our cash, well, it's like the cash has been -- we're not spending the cash recklessly.The value of the cash for reporting purposes is affected by interest rates. Again, we don't take any credit risk. We just take interest rate risk. So we have an average of 21 months, and that means we're exposed to interest rate fluctuations. Let's go on to Slide 10. Any more questions about that, please call Matt later and ask them because that's about as much as I can explain about how we report our cash. Slide 10. We've got about maybe $13 million of spend on, especially the installment tax payments. So again we'd like to share that with you because if you're thinking about how much cash does Park really have, that's relevant. This is a liability we have. It's on our books, but we still have to pay the IRS over the next three years or something like that, that $12.6 million.Cash dividends, every quarter we cover this. Let's go to the last check item. Park has paid $558 million now in cash dividends since the beginning of 2005. And I'll give you my comment that I always give you, which is that that's a hell a lot of money for a small company like Park, $558 million cash dividend. Let's go on to Slide 11. Share repurchase authorization. This has been kind of a hot topic of late. We announced in May 23, 2022 that our Board authorized a purchase of 1.5 million shares of companies -- of our Park stock, common stock. And did we purchase anything in Q3? No, we didn't purchase anything but not for not trying. So maybe the market was making us an offer that we couldn't refuse. Well, we've been in blackout since middle of November, but during the Q3 period where we were not in the blackout, remember, stock went down to like, I don't know, $10.11 or something like that.It was trading in the tens for a little while than they have. At that point, we felt the market might be making us an offer we couldn't refuse. I told you the last time, we don't think it's our job to buy stock. We think it's your job to buy stock, your job to decide whether you want to buy stock or not. We don't think it's really our principal job. Our principal job is what? Do everything within our power to enhance the fundamental value of the company. That's what we're working every day. We're not market traders. So we're not too excited about buying 5,000 or 10,000 shares a day. It seems kind of like suddenly you waste your time in petty. But when the stock was tuned to that level, we felt maybe the market was making an offer we couldn't refuse.Worked through an amount of buyback. They're doing a great job. If you ever know somebody who wants to do a buyback program I'd recommend them without reservation. And we were looking for blocks and big ones, but we didn't find anything. And we're told that the institutions are more really all buyers, not sellers. So we couldn't find anything. And then if you remember, the stock started to move away from us up to $11, $12, $13, $14. At that point we backed out because we don't want to compete against actual outside buyers who are buying the stock. I just want you to know that I'm not saying the price here. We're not saying that the price goes down to $10.5 we will be back in the market. That's for us to know, and you not to know this. That's -- we will discuss what we will do in the future.I just want to give you the facts as to what happened in the past, all right? So for your perspective. Last item with interest rates rising, era of cheap and easy money coming to an end, we hope with Park's hard-earned money finally would be worth something, maybe we hope so. Let's go on item, Slide 12, rather. This is -- we cover this every quarter. Let's just go through it. AAE Aerospace. That's the MK125 warhead with a standard missile 2, SM 2. That's a really nice program. I like being on that program. Let's see in the next Kratos Defense, well, you can see the Kratos Valkyrie. We're really very pleased being in that program. It's a really exciting program. We love working with Kratos also. And I don't know if you saw it, but just recently announced that they did a new deal with Kratos with the navy for a couple of Valkyrie aircraft.So that's exciting for us anyway. Lockheed Martin, well, that's secret program. We're not allowed to talk about it. So we can't give you pictures or anything else. But they are in the top 5. So we can tell you they were top 5 in Q3, and that's what we can tell you with that. And Middle River, yes, we know who they are, MRAS, we call them. And that's the like the Comac 919 with the LEAP-1C engines. And then Nordam, bottom right, the Bombardier Global 8000 with the Passport 20 engines. Actually, MRAS is on that program as well as Nordam, but we're choosing to focus on Nordam this time for the Bombardier Global 8000. Let's keep going. Slide 13, our pie charts. I guess what I would high level of interest is if you look at fiscal '22 and fiscal '23 first nine months, boy, it sure looks the same, doesn't it, hardly any change at all.I mean commercial is actually the exact same percentage. So it seems like the pie chart kind of break segmentation is stabilizing more or less at these levels, at least for now. Look at fiscal '21, that was that pandemic year, let's call it, and commercial was way, way off. Remember, maybe you do remember, the airplanes being flown empty, remember that? Okay. Let's go on to Slide 14. Park loves niche military aerospace programs. This is a slide we always do. This is -- Donna does the presentation, he does a great job, and Donna works over the holidays and everything. It's really great duty by work by Donna. Elena is the one who comes up with the programs for the Park niche military aerospace slide. So I want to give her some shot at it as well.What do we have here, the ASTER 30 missile, those are blades, the Predator Radome materials, the Growler Radome, structures materials and the Poseidon structured materials. When you look at the pie chart, rocket nozzles, drones, Radomes, I would all consider those all to be niche markets for us. And we focus really on niche markets more than commoditized markets in commercial and military, especially military. Okay, so let's go on to Slide 15. Military markets. So not every slide we have is happy slide, but that's not what we're doing here. We're just trying to tell you what we think. The new world order, the sea change, the war in Europe grinds on. Many of the governments seem to be willing and maybe even eager to continue to sponsor and fund the war with military hardware and equipment and other things.And Asia is not a happy place either these days. There's now open talk about the possibility of nuclear war. You mean like the end of civilization on earth nuclear war. Is that the kind of the nuclear war we're talking about? Elon Musk wants to establish colonies on Mars to preserve human race in case we do not make it here on earth. You better hurry. This is a joke and not for us anyway. The bottom line for us is that we hope, we sincerely hope the warring nations find a way to end their war and stop the killing soon. What a waste of life. But even if they do, we believe the aggressive military buildups will likely continue for a while because there's so much ill will, fear and distrust in the world now. Let's go into Slide 16. Like I said, not every slide's a happy slide, but that's not our job.Our job is, I think, to tell you what we think. Slide 16, not surprisingly, there's currently much emphasis in many parts of the world, on aggressively expanding military budgets and spending in the U.S. and foreign countries and also not surprisingly, missile defense systems, including the PAC-3 Patriot missile. One of the key areas of emphasis for increased defense spending. That's probably in a shocker in the circumstances, the missile defense systems to be very important. And this is like the preeminent missile defense system, I think, for -- at least for a lot of initial systems, the PAC-3 I'm talking about. Remember, the Patriot missile that was in the first Gulf War back in the early '90s. Well, this is obviously next-generation. There's multiple generations after it, but it's been around for a while, actually.On Slide 17, Park supports the PAC-3 missile defense system with specially ablative composite materials. And our ablative composite materials are sole-source qualified in that program. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Netherlands, Romania are buying PAC-3 missile systems or upgrading systems. I think next quarter, we probably want to just give you a list of countries that are not buying the -- or not using the PAC-3 missile system. And during President Zelensky's visit to Washington, the U.S. committed to providing PAC-3 missile systems to Ukraine. That's a big thing because they've been asking it for a long time. So that's like the big gohona finally. Ukraine gets the PAC-3 missile system. So the last item on 17, Slide 17, we previously discussed we are getting a lot of indications about increased demands for ablative materials, and this RAYCARB C2B product to support the PAC-3 missile system and other missile systems.Let's go on to Slide 18. So just the first item, the check item, just kind of -- we're just updating you, we gave you prior indications on this number. As an update, Park is currently forecasting total fiscal '23 sales of ablative materials and RAYCARB C2B product to be approximately $7.5 million. So again, we're just doing that because we've given you indications in Q1 and Q2 when we want to update that indication. Serious supply chain and inventory management challenges continue to be potential significant strength in the pace of the global military build-ups. So why don't we continue? Let's go on to Slide 19. So what I think we'll do here, just to save time, this is one of the examples of -- this is an example of what I was discussing during the introductory comments before starting the presentation.This section of this presentation was included in our Q2 presentation. So we'll just skim over it. We're not going to take the time to go over in detail but I want you to have it. So that, like I said, you have one stop shopping. The Q3 presentation is holistic. You don't have to go looking around for prior presentations to figure out what we're talking about. Just on Slide 19, commercial aviation industry continues it's strong recovery. Let's go to Slide 20 quickly. They're watch items at the top here. We talked about these before. They haven't gone away. So important watch items. And the big question now at the bottom of the slide is if the commercial aviation industry falters, what will the commercial aircraft industry do, how will they respond.In our opinion, whether you're talking about Boeing or Airbus, the answer might be quite different. Let's go on to Slide 21. And the commercial aircraft industry is facing this kind of same kind of challenges everybody is facing at the top of the page. Interesting wrinkle is that international travel is recovering more quickly than people thought. And that's good news for the wide bodies. Go on that top of Slide 22, and that includes the Boeing 777X aircraft, which we'll discuss in more detail later on in the presentation. And silver lining, just to go over this quickly, again as jet fuel prices increase, that gives the airlines more incentive to switch off their older legacy gas-guzzling aircraft for the more modern fuel-efficient airplanes.They'll do it earlier than they originally planned as they have math, they have their own formulas and stuff like that, every airline does. It's not that complicated. It's all numbers. But as the fuel price goes up, that's a big variable. That affects the equation, and that means, okay now we're going to switch out our older airplanes earlier. So that's good news if you're supplying in to the new airplanes. Slide 23, GE Aviation, jet engine programs. We're not going to go over this in great detail. This slide, we include in every presentation with some minor modifications. Firm pricing LTA with a requirement contract from '19 to '29 with Middle River Aerostructure Systems. We call them MRAS, a subsidiary of ST Engineering Aerospace, which is a Singapore company.So all these programs here are GE Aviation programs. You're probably wondering, well, what does it have to do with Middle River, ST Engineering. Well, GE Aviation sold Middle River, MRAS, ST Engineering a few years ago. All these programs date back to when MRAS was owned by GE Aviation. That's the connection with GE Aviation even though GE Aviation doesn't own MRAS anymore, all these programs are GE Aviation programs as you'll see. We've done -- in fact we talked about that many times. We've built, we've done the PAC-3 for GE Aviation and for MRAS to support these programs. Sole source for composite materials for engine nacelles and thrust reversers for multiple programs, A320, Neo family, 747, 2 Comac airplanes and Bombardier Global. And then if you go to the bottom right corner of the page, we now start to talk about the 777X produced with our AFP composite materials.And I always like to say, a wonderful picture of the 747-8 engine nacelles and I love this picture because the person in the background there gives you the perspective on the scale and size of the structures. Let's go on to Slide 24. So we have a lot of slides update on GE Aviation programs, and we'll try to move through them quickly, but they are important to Park. So we want to cover them a little bit. First, I'll start with the A320neo family of aircraft and then with the LEAP-1A engines. That includes 19, 20, 320, 321, 321LR, 321XLR. The reason we say LEAP-1A engines is because A320neo program aircraft has two approved engines. One is the LEAP-1A engine produced by CFM, which is a JV between GE Aviation and Safran. That one is a CRDI engine.See also 12 Stocks That Benefit From Rising Interest Rates and 10 Best High Risk High Reward Stocks To Buy.We're only on the CFM engine. So if an airline buys a A320neo and they specify the CRDI engine, then that's not -- there's nothing in it for us. They specify the CFM engine, then there's a lot of it for us. So just want to understand, maybe I should have made them more clear in some of these presentations. Anyway, let's focus on the A320neo, the aircraft part of it, discussed over many quarters that Airbus is aggressively trying to push up the rates and the supply chain has held Airbus back to a large extent. There's been some tension between Airbus and supply chain. And why don't we just move on because we discussed that tension and that dynamic many times in the past. Slide 25. So this is important. Airbus had indicated its intention to achieve A320neo aircraft family production rates at 65 per month by early 2024.And that was pushed back from mid-2023, which was the original target because of supply chain restrictions or limitations and 75 airplanes per month by mid-2025. Just so you know that's a lot, a lot of airplanes, no commercial program ever achieved those rates before. I believe that the A320neo, that Airbus was producing 63 per month before the pandemic hit. So they are still trying to claw their way back up to even that level. This airplane will, I think indisputably be the biggest selling commercial aircraft ever. Airbus also recently indicated its intention to achieve production and delivery rate of 50 neos per month by the end of 2022. Well, it looks like they did that, November, they got to 53. In December, preliminary report I saw yesterday, it was 58 in December.So that's a preliminary report. Hopefully, that number will hold, but that's what I saw in the report. Is that rate sustainable? I don't know. I mean Airbus certainly is on a mission to make it sustainable and move it up from there. One thing which according to Airbus is quite clear, is the market in the A320 aircraft family backlog, they are there to support these aggressive rates. Current backlog is 6,349 airplanes. That's a lot, a lot of airplanes, a lot of airplanes. And just to give you a perspective, at the 50 a month, what is that? 50 times 12, that's 600, right. Divide 6,349 by 600. That's over 10 years. So you see the problem that Airbus has, you want to order a new A320neo now? Well, I guess they have to give you a delivery of like 2034 or something like that.That's terrible. They don't want that. This is one of the reasons that they are trying to push the radomes that the lead times aren't so long. They obviously want to increase the backlog, but they don't want to keep increasing the lead times for these airplanes. Let's keep going. Slide 26. Okay, some recent disappointing news from Airbus. First of all, they said they wanted to ship 700 total commercial aircraft in 2022. Not going to make that -- didn't make it. I saw a couple of reports yesterday, maybe 640, 672, but they indicated, I don't know, maybe about a month ago that they weren't going to make a 700, so that wasn't a surprise. Another recent announcement, which probably is more impactful to Park. I'll just read from a quote, ""Taking into account, this is Airbus, the fact that this complex environment will persist longer than previously expected, Airbus will be adjusting the speed of A320 family ramp-up to rate 65 for '23 and '24.It's not completely clear at this time as to when Airbus expects to reach the rate of 65 deliveries per month."" So they're saying that, remember, they said what was it, going to be early 2024. Yes, early 2024 -- now they're saying, well, maybe that's not going to work. But they're not going to -- they haven't said what's the new target for reaching the 65 rate is, although they maintain that they want to be at 75 by the middle of decade 2025. So at this point anyway, they're not pushing that out, but they were putting a cloud over the 65 and when they're going to get to 65. Now it's interesting that there's been recent news that the engine companies are more or less caught up because if you go on to Slide 27, the engine companies were the main culprit in terms of slowing down Airbus' ability to ramp these rates.And the Airbus CEO recently confirmed that the engine companies are basically caught up. But there are lots of other supply chain constraints other than engines, forging, casting, you name it, it's a real challenge with the supply chain, real challenge. You know the story. I mean, with the pandemic, lots of companies scaled back, laid off lots, lots of people, and now there's an aggressive attempt to ramp back up and everybody is just flat-footed people just reported. So I was wondering, people still not going back to work. There's lots and lots of job openings available, lots of people that aren't working. So we won't go through that in any detail. I think you know that story. And a June 17, 2022 news release, we kind of staked out our ground, if you will.We said, look, we're going to support Airbus, don't matter what, no matter what the ramp rate is. And then as of the end of October 2022, there are some meaningful statistic data for you. CFM had a 60.7% share. Remember, the CFM shares, the A320neo program with Pratt, 60.7% so way over half and that's firm orders. This is not just speculation of the firm orders. And let's see -- how many were there? There is yes, right here, 6,816 firm orders for LEAP-1A engines. So over 10,000 firm engine orders. So there's a lot of bounce in that number. I mean it can move around a little bit month-to-month, but there's so many firm orders that are already in existence that, that share is probably not going to change so quickly. So the share obviously favors CFM, which is good for Park, as I explained.So on Slide 37, we tell you what we believe approximately how much revenue we receive for LEAP-1A unit. So maybe you can do your own math and figure out what this LEAP-1A backlog might be worth to Park. And like I said, Airbus wants to take more orders. That's like the whole world of it in terms of A320neos and I'm sure LEAP-1A and Pratt engines as well. Slide 28 the A321XLR, we discussed this probably several quarters now, pretty exciting program for Park, again, with the LEAP-1A engines. First test flight was in June with a Leap-1A engine, not a CRDI engine. You look at their single-aisle aircraft, it's the only single-aisle aircraft, which with 5,000-plus statute mile range, we'll go back to that in a minute. It's kind of interesting. And the other item highlighted here, Airbus recently conducted an A321XLR, long-duration test flight at 13-plus hours.That's a long, long, long time for a single-aisle airplane. That's kind of unheard of, actually. If you go on a 380 or 747, you might be up in the air for 12, 13 hours, but a single-aisle I don't think so. So and you know this, Boeing has said that they're not going to respond. They're not going to produce a new commercial aircraft this decade. They're not going to introduce a new commercial aircraft this decade. So Boeing has ceded this whole niche, this market to Airbus which is a good thing for Park, of course, since we are on that program. Slide 29, let's go on to some other GE Aviation programs. Comac 919, we talked about the big news last quarter. The bigger news is that Comac got their production certificate for the C919. Now the production certificate is a real big deal because that allows Comac to go into volume production in this aircraft.Production certificates are often more difficult to obtain than Type certificates. There's a lot more fanfare about Type certificates. But there are a lot of airplanes that got Type certificates, never got production certificates and never heard of them and because they didn't go into production. So production certificates are, I guess, not as much fanfare often, but probably more significant. That's a big deal they got the production certificate. And there are 686 firm orders for 919 at this point, all for the Chinese market, I suspect. They have LEAP-1C engines, CFM again. On Slide 30, we haven't really discussed the COMAC ARJ21 very much in the last few quarters. But we just saw a report recently that there were 26 ARJ21 aircraft delivered in '22.That's more than we expected. So we thought we'd highlight it for you. I mean we're happy to be on the program. We're going to say, again, this is for the Chinese market. Slide 31, we discussed the Bombardier Global 7500 and 8000 in the prior quarter. So we probably won't spend a lot of time on this slide. Mach 0.94 Max cruise speed, that's pretty fast. I think that they broke the sound barrier doing some in the test line, which is interesting. Slide 32, still with the GE Aviation area, we decided we'd provide a whole slide on the 2 slides on the fan case. We haven't done this in the past because the 777X program had been kind of dormant and maybe in limbo. We weren't sure -- people weren't sure what was going. But it seems like it's going ahead.The fan case containment wrap for the GE9X engine for Boeing 777 aircraft, that's our end of the deal the fan case containment wrap. Let's talk about the aircraft, the 777-8 variant, over 10,000 statute miles. Remember, I was saying that 5,000 statute mile range for the XLR is a big deal. This is not big league for wide bodies, 10,000 statute mile range. That's gone a long, long way. 425 seats depending on the -- how they set up the seat arrangements. And since the 747 and A320 programs have been canceled, there's no other commercial aircraft, which is anything close to those range in passenger capacity capabilities. So this is going to be an important niche, could be an important aircraft for Boeing. Hope it works for them. I'm not aware. I don't think anybody is aware that Airbus has been trying to develop an airplane to compete against this airplane either, the 777X.Passenger and freighter version certification expected in 2025. This picture was sent to me by a friend of mine from a company called Alaska Air Fuel in Fairbanks. The airplane is on the ramp, at the Alaska Air Fuel ramp in Fairbanks. It was up there doing, just one a test aircraft doing cold weather testing in Fairbanks in the winter. And if you want to do a cold weather testing of an airplane, Fairbanks is a place to go because you can easily see minus 40, minus 50 degrees temperature. So I really like that picture I put to share with you. Slide 33, I'm trying to move a little faster, I guess. So continuing with the 777X program, there was a little bit of interruption in the test program and it's has been resumed, 353 firm orders. And what do we do?We produced composite -- AFP composite materials for the GE9X fan case. We have significant per engine content in this program. And we recently quoted materials for the program exceeding $1.2 million. Why am I sharing that with you? Not so much a number, just to say, yes, this looks like it's getting real now for Park. We haven't seen the POs yet. I want to make that clear, but we did receive a quote request for -- and we did quote $1.2 million approximately for delivery in 2023. And remember, there's that design risk. We've talked about this in the past. The company that makes their fan case is trying to read us in their fan case, so our case wrap is not necessary. So the fan case can pass the fan blade out test without a case wrap. Slide 34, 747 queen of the skies.The last 747 rolled out of Boeing Everett, Washington factory, December 6, 2022. It was unit 1,574. It will be delivered to Atlas Air in early 2023. First, 747, we delivered to Pan Am, January 22, 1970. This is the airplane that changed the world. It's heartbreaking at least for me to see this program end. This picture was taken October 10, 2022, in Anchorage, obviously Atlas Air, 747-8 and they get the last one. So anyway, okay, I took that picture. Let's move on to Slide 35. Yes. So this is where it gets a little complicated. You kind of think what the heck is going on here. If you look at the history on the left-hand side of the left-hand column with the numbers, see in fiscal '22 and fiscal '23, that's $6-plus million per quarter for GE Aviation program sales history and forecast estimates, so $6 million to $7 million per quarter.The prior year was the pandemic year. So the number is much lower. But in '22 and first two quarters of '23, over $6 million a quarter. And then in Q3, just $5 million, the recent quarter, $5 million. And we actually estimate I think quarters for three quarters when we did the Q2 presentation. So we're gaining a little bit above that but still well below the history. So I think what's going on here. The programs are going -- aren't going down. The programs are going up. Let's go to the right side, GE Aviation program sales forecast estimate for Q4. So we're now, again, estimating $4.25 million to $4.75 million. And if you do the total, that's just adding up the year-to-date through Q3 with the estimate for Q4. That just the math. But I want to mention to you that we have $5.8 million already booked for Q1 for fiscal '24 Q1, and we would expect to book more in 4Q book and ship more than that.So what the heck is going on here? And that could be a watch out sign, maybe a warning. So let's go on to the next slide. What the heck is going on here Part 2? So downstream inventory, production management challenges, dislocations, causing serious misalignments between the aircraft program rates and the Park's material production rates. At some point, maybe soon, those misalignments will be unsustainable and will reach a breaking point and the day of reckoning could lead to abrupt and even wrenching adjustments and realignments. It's just math. If our production isn't matching what Airbus is doing and the other companies that are using these GE engines than something's got to give at some point. Remember, we're sole source these programs.On a day-to-day basis, downstream dislocations create major challenges for Park in managing our production and supply chain activities. We're trying to get some visibility and we keep getting these kind of strange indications as we saw in Q2 -- sorry, Q3 and now Q4. But this is a big one for us anyway. Over the long term, only things are two things which matter to Park in connection with the GE Aviation programs we support are. How many airplanes are delivered that have these engines on? The LEAP-1A, A320neo with LEAP-1A, 919, the ARJ21, the Global 7500/8000 on the 777X. The other thing that matters if you want to complete the equation is the top of Slide 37, the expected Park revenue per engine unit for those programs. Based upon Park material usage for engine units for those programs, which usage is given to us by our customer.So starting in 2025, we're getting this information because we kind of got exacerbated trying to predict what's going to happen. We're going to tell you -- we're telling you now what our estimated revenue per engine is, and you could decide how many units you want to assume in terms of doing the math. Starting in 2025, based upon the program engine material usage information provided to us by the customer, the estimated Park revenues by program end unit is approximately as follows. So for A320 neo family, $30,500, for the ARJ21, $29,500, the 919, $26,500, the Global 7500/8000, $49,000. Now there are assumptions contained in each of these items, which you need to look at. We're not predicting those things will happen. We're just doing the best we can to kind of guess as to what will happen based upon indications from our customer.And this particularly relates to LSP and film adhesives, which programs we'll be using our LSP products that are not using them now and film adhesives that are not using them now. So we have to make a little some assumptions there. But we made the assumptions we think are reasonable, but they may or may not be correct. I just want to make sure you understand that. The last item, GE9X fan case, it's significant. We're not going to give you a number yet. It's still kind of a new program. I think it's a little early to do that. And of course, there is a risk that the program -- that the fan cases we designed in the program doesn't continue. So okay, Slide 39. Now let's talk about Park's financial performance, history and forecast estimates. Nothing to overshadow here, I don't think, but I just want to mention to you that we just kind of covered this.You look at their sales numbers for fiscal '20 -- the quarter for fiscal '22 and '23, remember through Q2 that the GE Aviation program sales were $6 million plus each of those quarters, right? Then in fiscal -- in Q3, the current quarter only $5 million, but the total sales were still $13.9 million. Somebody who's pretty smart figured it out what's going on here. Well, obviously, we're getting to those numbers by making up the lack of GE Aviation sales with non-GE Aviation sales. They look at the forecast for Q4, $13.5 million to $14 million we're estimating but we're only estimate of $4.5 million GE Aviation sales. So again, I think you should be thinking about that. Well, it probably means that the non-GE Aviation sales are moving the right direction.EBITDA estimate $3 million to $3.5 million. And for fiscal '23, again, we're just trying to doing the math. We're taking year-to-date and added the estimate for Q4 and those are the numbers we come up with. Let's go on to Slide 40. And this we're going to skip because we covered these comments and thoughts about our forecast and outlook during the last couple of quarters and there's not really not too much change to them. We feel -- just to reiterate that to provide a long-term forecast under the circumstances, with the great uncertainty that we're dealing with wouldn't be that meaningful. And if you want to skip, we can do that to Slide 43, the end of this section, we're saying that based upon all these considerations, although there are serious concerns about the economy inflation, workforce shortages, supply chain challenges, we believe the outlook for Park is quite positive.So we don't think that we're in a position to provide a meaningful long-term forecast with numbers. But we are able to say, based upon this discussion, that we think the outlook for Park is quite positive. So let's go on to Slide 44. Just some quick updates here. The expansion is basically complete. The qualifications should be done in a few months. And middle picture, we haven't -- and there's the top and bottom picture, we showed those before. The middle picture though is a passage way between the new plant and the old plant. We're looking at from the new plant, looking into the old plant. And if you look at the top picture at the back you see that the passage right at the top of the picture, I don't know if you could see it. There's a sign in this picture, the best way picture on the right.And it basically says it's a fire door. And if there's a fire, that door will close automatically. Why is that? Because terms redundant factory, so there's anything that goes -- happens to one factory. You want to make sure it's isolated, so it doesn't migrate it to the other factory. Why don't we go on Slide 45, James Webb? So we talk about this every quarter. No more revenue for Park. I don't think we're going to get any more product up in the James Webb Space Telescope. It's 1 million miles from earth right now. But it does have our '21 SigmaStruts incorporated into structure. And those struts are critical. We have those that struts, telescope structure wouldn't work, it wouldn't happen -- just would collapse. Couple of interesting items, the James Webb spotted concentric angular rings around a giant star showing the first reasonable evidence of light pushing dust around the right of it is an image of that.I've no idea what it means, but to me, it just seems very all inspiring. And it James Webb uncovers dense cosmic knot in the early universe, again, that's way above my pay scale. But to me, it just seems so inspiring to hear are those kind of things about our comprehension, new comprehensive, new wind sites, let's put it that way into the universe. Slide 46, okay. So we talked about this Aero Design Labs program over the last couple of quarters, the ADRS program. Park's materials are currently sole-source qualified on this program. There are over 6,000 Boeing 737 engine aircraft in service. This program is for the Boeing 737NG aircraft. In May 2022, the ADL received an STC for the 737-700. In November, ADL entered into an MOU with Delta to do the testing and certification for its kits for the 737-800 and 900 variants.So that's all good. And based upon the forecast provided by the customer, Park expects to receive revenues of approximately $2 million in calendar year 2023 related to this program. Actually, a good portion of it's already booked, I think. But why we're telling you that, only because we want you to know that this seems like it's real. It's happening. We're not the customer ADLs at the current low key. We're not going to provide additional information about the program, the expectations, the forecast, we're not going there. But we wanted to at least cover this. And the part about Delta, that's public. That was in the news release, we're not disclosing anything that you probably don't already know. And we'll consider additional investment for this program if necessary.This could be a big thing for Park. So we're happy about that. Let's see what happens. Slide 47. Okay, last quarter, we talked about AFP, updated Park on potential automated Fiber Placement, AFP manufacturing project initiative. We originally discussed this during our Q2 call, as I just said, let's do an update. Not much of an update project that's under series consideration and review. We haven't made a decision yet. It's a front burner project for us. We're seeing a lot of high-level attention to focus. However, I just want to let you know, there's the potential AFP manufacturing project is competing for high-level Park management attention to focus with the potential major multi-front JV project with a large aerospace company. This is something that's just been developing in the last over months, but it's got to become a fun version project as well.The potential JV project is ongoing serious consideration to review receiving a significant amount of attention. So there's somewhat of a balancing act for little Park to manage both these important potential opportunities at the same time. Good problem to have, just wanted to know that. This should be a real word part of it. Let's go into 48. Now these slides are the same slides that were included in the prior presentation about the potential AFP project. Through us, AFP is a very interesting potential strategic opportunity for Park. And in the slide, the next few slides, we go through the reasons why we think AFP is interesting, but we're not going to go back and review all the slides just to save some time. Obviously, you have any questions, let us know.But Slides 48 to 51 were pretty much what was contained in the Q2 presentation with some minor changes. Let's go on to Slide 52. We're almost there. The Park family, updates on Park's great customer Flex program. We feature this every quarter, and we should because it's really important. It would just not be possible to continue to get the job done under current very challenging circumstances without our customer Flex program, just not possible. Park's current people count, 112. Well, that's some progress. It's still not we want to be, but our current people count of 112 was up from the people count of 99 reported in our Q2 investor presentation. The great news is all the progress we made has been made the right way, the Park way, the little picture of a few of the guys that won our 2022 holiday party paper airplanes throwing contest.This is an annual event at Park. So congratulations to those guys, and we're now. But I want to point out something. In Q3, we were kind of limping along at 98, 99, 100, 101, 102. It's only after Q3 that we really ramped up to this 112 number. So everything that was done, everything got done, the 13.9 million that was shipped in Q3, we shipped a very, very stressed staff, a very short staff, maybe 100, 101, 102. I just want you to be aware of that. Slide 53, we do not sell out or compromise our sacred principles in order to recruit the additional people we need. That's really important. And just so you know, other companies, multi larger companies continue to aggressively target our people for recruitment. Now a question. Will they feel bad if sooner or later, they know -- we all know they will, what will these larger companies do with the people they aggressively recruited.So yes, we don't know the answer to that question. As soon as these people aren't needed, they'll be thrown out like yesterday's garbage on the garbage sheet, which is what happens every time in the past. That's why I'm saying that. I don't think that's an outrageous comment. That's exactly what happened every time in the past. And you think that in the boardrooms of these companies that are hiring 1,000 people a time, throwing money, hiring bonuses, big money at these people, you think you're agonizing and hand wringing over, oh my god, what happens when the aircraft rates go down, what do we do with those people? It's not even being considered. Why? Because we know what they're going to do. They're going to throw them on the garbage sheet like they always do, the people they hired.But the good news is that we continue -- Park continues to make progress recruiting and the training people in the right way, the Park way, notwithstanding what these other companies might do or not do. When we hire someone, our attitude is we hire for life. We won't casually just so many people we hire, let's bring on 25 people. They're for life. Now it doesn't mean there are plenty of people Park is not right for them or vice versa. If that's the case, somebody doesn't have the right attitude for Park, they're not going to stay at Park. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about good people, the right attitudes, our attitude and we hire somebody. We think about it carefully, seriously. We're committed to them for life. We're not going to throw them in the garbage sheet as soon as our business is down.We didn't do that during the pandemic. Our business where we had less than -- I think, we had $9 million of sales in quarter. We didn't do it then. So that's not our intention. Our attitude is not -- people are not commodities, are not pork bellies to be traded, bid up and bid down that's different. So that's when I say we do things the Park way. That's what -- that's one example of what we're talking about. Let's go on to Slide 54. Our people have been through a lot together over the last few years and many challenges and hardships and diversity to overcome. I won't read you the list, you probably can figure it out yourself. The wonderful news is that having endured and overcome the hardships adversity and challenge together, our Park family has overcome -- has come together more closely and tightly than ever before.With a dedicated, motivated and inspired workforce, a company can move mountains. Without such a workforce, a company to move nothing. And our people are moving mountains. To have 100 people push out $13.9 million in the quarter, there's some mountains being moved. I'll tell you that. Park is very fortunate and has the wonderful people we have. The last slide, this is the Christmas party, and you can see some of these folks with the Christmas ugly sweaters. This was -- this is probably most of the Park people. It's not all 112 of them, but we have a very nice Christmas party in which we take a picture of the Park family for you. So sorry that went on so long. We're just about an hour into the presentation. So operator, we're ready to take questions if there are any.Thank you, everybody, for listening so far.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Data from the manufacturing sector also reiterated the same, contracting in December.With wage increases slowing despite higher nonfarm payrolls, the consensus was that the central bank would slow down its interest rate hikes going forward. The markets took off on what they believed to be the end of one of the Fed’s most aggressive tightening cycles in decades.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

(NASDAQ:ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, and Nashville Biosciences LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), today announced an agreement with Amgen, a global biopharmaceutical company, to whole-genome sequence approximately 35,000 DNA samples. The sample cohort is primarily made up of DNA from African Americans, who are currently underrepresented in research for the clinical applications of genomics, including drug target discovery. This cohort will be the largest data set of genomes of its kind to date.It's widely recognized that most genomic data sets are drawn from people of European ancestry. This lack of diversity in genomic data has created a gap in the scientific understanding of the underlying genetic causes of disease and inhibits equitable access to precision health therapies.Sequencing this set of samples is the first in Illumina and Nashville Biosciences' Alliance for Genomic Discovery (AGD), a multiyear agreement to accelerate therapeutic development through large-scale genomics and establish a preeminent clinico-genomic data set.Launched in 2022, the AGD aims to whole-genome sequence at least 250,000 de-identified human DNA samples from VUMC's BioVU biobank over two and a half years in collaboration with multiple biopharmaceutical companies. The BioVU samples were extracted from blood collected during routine clinical testing. The patients who provided them consented to research use, and the samples are linked to extensive de-identified clinical data derived from VUMC's electronic medical records.""The whole-genome sequencing of these 35,000 samples will work toward greater diversity of genomic data to ultimately enable improved access to precision therapies for all people,"" said Joydeep Goswami, chief strategy and corporate development officer and interim chief financial officer of Illumina.Story continues""The initial cohort will be among the largest sequencing efforts involving African Americans to date,"" said Leeland Ekstrom, chief executive officer of Nashville Biosciences. ""Once complete, this data set will provide a wealth of new information about the human genome and accelerate the study of disease in-and discovery of new therapeutics for-populations less well represented in prior large-scale sequencing efforts. The opportunity to sequence this diverse set of samples will help broaden our understanding for individuals who have been underrepresented in genetic research and continue to experience health disparities.""As part of the agreement announced today, deCODE genetics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, will perform whole-genome sequencing on the 35,000 samples using Illumina sequencing technologies and will upload the data to the Illumina Connected Analytics platform.""deCODE's sophisticated human data capabilities are well positioned to sequence these samples and analyze the resulting data to provide a better scientific understanding of disease through the context of human diversity,"" said Kári Stefánsson, founder of deCODE genetics. ""Insights from human data, including both genetics and clinical records, can help inform how medicines may affect different patient populations.""Pharma and biotech collaborators that plan to participate in the AGD and in further sequencing may soon be announced. Researchers will analyze the data for drug discovery and therapy development. The data will also be returned to BioVU to be made available for academic research within the Vanderbilt community.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

The report analyzes the results of an online survey taken by engineers and executives working in a broad range of industries at companies located in the United States, Germany and China.""Our findings emphasize the importance of collaboration and shed light on the qualities that organizations must have if they hope to continue innovating in the current economic environment and beyond,"" said CEO Terrence Curtin.According to the survey, the difference in how executives and engineers approach innovation begins with how they define it. Fifty-seven percent of executives said innovation is a total transformation, while 55% of engineers define innovation as an iteration or improvement. The potential impact of this disparity is reflected in the data, as nearly half of the engineers surveyed say their organization's goals for innovation are unrealistic and that they struggle to meet them; only 34% of executives agreed.Although there may be disagreement in what innovation truly means, it remains important to both groups surveyed. In fact, 90% of executives and 88% of engineers rank it as their organization's top priority, with the areas of renewable energy and cloud computing being a particular focus in the near future. Investment in innovation is a sticking point, however--83% of engineers think their company needs to fund innovation more to meet their goals, while 53% of executives see the need.Story continuesThe survey unveiled a potential misalignment between engineers and executives on the importance of sustainable innovation—one in five engineers say their company does not have a clear strategy for implementing sustainable practices, something Curtin sees as a red flag.""As we innovate, it's vital that TE and companies across industries keep sustainability at the forefront as we collaboratively work toward a better tomorrow,"" he said.TE has published a full analysis of the survey results, identifying 10 key takeaways for engineers and executives to consider as they refine their innovation culture within their organizations.View the Industrial Technology Index at te.com/techindex.ABOUT TE CONNECTIVITY TE Connectivity (NYSE: TEL) is a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive and connected future.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on ANSYS is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$577m ÷ (US$6.2b - US$610m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, ANSYS has an ROCE of 10%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 10%. View our latest analysis for ANSYS roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for ANSYS compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at ANSYS, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 17%, but since then they've fallen to 10%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On ANSYS' ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by ANSYS' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 55% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesIf you're still interested in ANSYS it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

In that same time, the Consumer Discretionary sector lost 0.94%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.03%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from V.F. as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $1, down 25.93% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.48 billion, down 3.94% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.10 per share and revenue of $11.57 billion. These totals would mark changes of -33.96% and -2.31%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for V.F. should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

V.F. is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In terms of valuation, V.F. is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.09. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.14, so we one might conclude that V.F. is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that VFC has a PEG ratio of 4.44 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Textile - Apparel industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.58 as of yesterday's close.The Textile - Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

This stock has been absolutely hammered over the past year. The last 12 months, it's down nearly 45%. A little more.But today, it's actually having a good day. Up around 6%, I believe. Basically, what's going on here is it got a top pick from Wells Fargo, as well as Credit Suisse. Both of them in different ways.Wells Fargo is looking at the data center business for the company, essentially saying that they expect to see that kind of get increased in 2023. While Credit Suisse is looking at the gaming side seeing increases. It's worth pointing out that Wells Fargo also added AMD to its top pick list.Look, Nvidia has a huge market when it comes to the data center business. It's beating out the gaming business by a mile at this point, especially as we saw the gaming business get hurt because of those rough comparisons between 2020, 2021, and then 2022. The gaming industry just suffered massively as a result.But we're starting to come around on those comparisons. We should start to see it rebound in 2023. And I think that's really what these companies are looking at.DAVE BRIGGS: And AMD, Dan, also up about 6%, perhaps, on this same news. It was last month the UBS picked AMD, Nvidia, and Micron, top semiconductor stocks for '23. But Citi also out with a note most recently saying they expect semi sales down 10% in the quarter. That's up from their previous prediction of 7%. So the news has been mixed, if anything.And we thought that CHIPS Act was going to be a real catalyst for the whole industry. Really has turned out to be anything but. But perhaps in the long run, they'll be right here.]"

Investors will be keeping an eye on how their mortgage businesses are holding up and listening for signs of optimism on the broader economy. Lots to unpack here with these bank earnings.Guys, is this the quarter where JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon again brings out the warning on the state of the economy? He certainly could. He's been, I think, very out in front warning about where this economy might go in 2023. Is it also the quarter where JPMorgan starts to pull back on some of its tech investments, given the slowing economy? So those are a couple of things I'm watching as pertains to JPM.And then, of course, on news today of Goldman cutting 3,200 jobs. We knew it was coming, but still to see it is, I would say, concerning, and how does how does that CEO, David Solomon, get on that earnings call and project his business looking forward?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, those job cuts coming after we had already seen from JP Morgan and some of the other banks as well, even prior to or during the holiday season, saying that, hey, we're going to need to roll back on some of the bonuses, and that really kind of brings into question what the total compensation package for the existing and the retained base of employees would look like going forward as the banks are really waiting for deal making to come back in full force, waiting to see where investment banking really kind of regains some type of strength given some of the equity-market declines that we had seen in last year.And so with all of that in mind, this earnings period and what they forecast, perhaps, is going to be the biggest kind of takeaway item and what they're seeing in terms of deal making and where they're going to be able to drum up some type of demand for their investment-banking products as well.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, when we look at the Goldman news this morning, it reminds me a little bit of what we've seen from technology because part of it is sort of a pandemic payback, if you will. That is Goldman Sachs usually does an annual culling of its underperformers. It cuts them. Didn't really do that during the pandemic. So part of this is sort of now a delayed reaction, a delayed cutting of some of those folks. That's at least some of what is going on there. But we are perhaps going to hear more about cutting from these companies, especially given that maybe they're not totally prepared for what may be coming at this point.For example, Deutsche Bank last week downgrading Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Truist saying that bank stocks have yet to fully price in a US recession. So are investors fully accounting for the effect this could have on the banks? Are the banks themselves fully accounting for the effect? I think we're going to get lots of discussion around those issues.BRIAN SOZZI: Right. It seems like there's a disconnect, Julie, because I'm looking at some Morgan Stanley price-target changes ahead of earnings. They are cutting estimates on Citigroup and Goldman Sachs pretty significantly.But if you go pull up the KBW Bank Index, as we're showing here, I mean, these stocks have gone nowhere-- really nowhere over the past year despite rising yields, and theoretically that should be good for profit margins. I would argue that chart is suggesting, you know, we're in a recession at some point this year, and that impacts a lot of the businesses beyond deal making for the banks.BRAD SMITH: It runs a little bit counter to what we typically see from some bank activity, at least, during a rising interest-rate environment. They typically would be more beneficiary where they can get more money or earn more from the difference between some of the spreads in their loans.And I think for right now, they're still trying to manage what many other businesses are in trying to understand exactly what their cost structures look like. The cut that we're seeing at Goldman is roughly double what we had seen at Morgan Stanley. That was about 1,600 employees there. And so exactly the number of people that they need in order to continue the operations or the business as usual when business right now isn't kind of that usual operating procedure, if you will, too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah,. Just to take a step back, if you look at the big businesses of the banks, right-- net interest margin, the difference between what they put out and what they take in, basically, and what they lend, that's going to obviously be a big focus this year. Fee income related to everything from mortgage servicing to the deal making that we were talking about, all of these things are going to be in flux this year and are difficult to predict, I think.]"

Morgan's healthcare conference in San Francisco, said ""We are not in discussions. We have an agreement already for local manufacturing of Paxlovid in China. So we have a local partner that will make Paxlovid for us, and then we will sell it to the Chinese market.""Pfizer has a licensing agreement with the U.N-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) that allows 35 drugmakers around the world to make cheap versions of Paxlovid and supply the treatment in 95 poorer countries.That licence does not allow them to sell generic Paxlovid in China, where infections have surged since December, prompting a severe shortage of flu and COVID drugs.A box of Paxlovid, used for a single course of treatment, is changing hands for as much as 50,000 yuan ($7,313), according to local media reports and social media posts, against the original price of around 2,000 yuan.Bourla said the company had shipped thousands of courses of the treatment in 2022 to China and in the past couple of weeks, had increased that to millions.On Sunday, China's Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) said that the country would not include Paxlovid in an update to its list of medicines covered by basic medical insurance schemes as the U.S. firm quoted a high price for the COVID-19 drug.The drug is currently covered by China's broad healthcare insurance scheme under temporary measures until the end of March.Story continuesBourla said that talks with China on future pricing for the treatment had broken off after China had asked for a lower price than Pfizer is charging for most lower middle income countries.""They are the second highest economy in the world and I don't think that they should pay less than El Salvador,"" Bourla said.The failure of the talks to include Pfizer in the list of medicines covered by basic state health insurance generated heated discussions on Chinese social media on Monday.Some Chinese media reported that Pfizer had lowered the price of Paxlovid to 600 yuan in the negotiations, triggering a wave of criticism and questions on social media as to why Chinese regulators had not accepted that price.A separate report by financial magazine Caixin on Monday cited unnamed sources as saying that Pfizer had not lowered its price significantly beyond the 1,890 yuan it currently charges Chinese hospitals.Pfizer declined to comment on the Chinese media reports about the price it quoted during the negotiations. NHSA did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on the negotiations.China's state media Global Times accused Pfizer of trying to profit from China's COVID battle in an opinion piece on Monday.""It is not a secret that U.S. capital forces have already accumulated quite a fortune from the world via selling vaccines and drugs, and the U.S. government has been coordinating all along. There is no so-called human right, but monopoly,"" it said.""If they do care about it (the epidemic in China), why don't Pfizer drop some pursuit of the profit, and cooperate with China with a little more sincerity?""Bourla said the removal from the list would not have an effect on the company's business there until April and the company could end up selling only to the private market in China.Pfizer signed a deal in August for Chinese drugmaker Zhejiang Huahai to produce Paxlovid in mainland China solely for patients there.Bourla said production is gearing up in China and progress has been made that may allow it to start manufacturing in the first half of the year, ahead of its year-end internal estimate.

213,6172773a-45c5-318b-81db-f64021739fae,PYPL,2023-01-10,15 Most Progressive Companies in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-progressive-companies-america-202521760.html,1673295921,STORY,"['PGR', 'ADBE', 'MAR', 'PYPL', 'ACN', 'WMT', 'CRM', 'AXP', 'HLT', 'JNJ']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 15 most progressive companies in America. If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America.According to McKinsey, since April 2021, over 19 million US workers have left their jobs. This record-breaking rate has caused business disruption across the world. Around 53% of employers have reported observing significantly high labor turnover compared to previous years, and 64% anticipate the issue to worsen in the coming months. Companies are now actively working towards identifying challenges and establishing progressive workplace practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the evolution of the workplace culture due to lockdowns and restrictions of movement across the world. There has been increased focus on diversity and inclusion at workplaces across the US.A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that motivate employees to reach their full potential. As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diversity—through the lenses of color, gender, skill, and sexual orientation — can serve to build companies. According to McKinsey’s “Diversity Wins” report, the possibility of outperformance increases with the level of gender diversity. For instance, businesses that have more than 30% female executives do better than those that have between 10% and 30% female executives. Companies with the highest levels of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts.A sense of inclusiveness has a strong relationship with employee engagement. People who have a strong sense of inclusion are more likely than others to express enthusiasm for and dedication to their organizations. McKinsey’s research revealed that a perceived lack of inclusiveness at a company led over 40% of respondents to decline or decide against applying for a job. Progressive workplaces such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are replacing the conventional workplace model where employees work on a clock and managers enforce strict rules and regulations without any room for open communication.Story continuesPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have referred to renowned publications and websites such as Forbes, Fortune 100, and Top Workplaces to shortlist the 15 most progressive companies in America. We have used 8 articles to report the consensus picks of established publications. These companies have been ranked in ascending order in terms of the number of sources that have termed them progressive.15 Most Progressive Companies in America15. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a Mayfield, Ohio-based insurance company. It is the third biggest insurance carrier in the US, with a presence in over 50 states. Furthermore, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is also the largest US automobile insurance provider, with a headcount of 51,431 employees as of 2022.The company has the distinction of filling up 80% of jobs above entry-level positions by promoting its talent internally. This reflects the entity’s focus on promoting internal growth opportunities for its employees. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also conducts a Multicultural Leadership Development Program for its employees. Over 60% of the program graduates are promoted to higher positions. According to “Great Place to Work,” 96% of employees think that the corporation makes them feel welcome at their initiation.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Progressive Corp had a positive contribution to performance during the quarter. Net Premiums Written (NPW) grew +12% as the Company grew both policies in force and took rate to offset higher loss cost trends that are being driven by inflation. For example, we estimate accident severity for personal auto are up +35% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, this is partially offset by a 20% decline in frequency, due to people driving fewer miles. Progressive is making up for this net rise in cost by raising policy rates in the mid-teens percentage range. Progressive has been relatively early to take rate compared to industry peers, so the Company should be able to aggressively compete for share as competitors play catchup.”14. Fidelity InvestmentsNumber of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2Fidelity Investments is a Boston, Massachusetts-based privately held financial services firm that provides financial planning solutions and advice related to retirement planning, wealth management, investing, trading, and brokerage services.Fidelity Investments is ranked 27 among the best employers for diversity by Forbes. The company provides its customers with the option of sustainable investing, as two-thirds of investors think that social impact is integral in determining where to invest. Abigail Johnson has led Fidelity Investments as President and CEO of the company since 2014. According to Great Place to Work, 88% of employees at Fidelity Investment think the company provides a conducive environment for personal growth. The company also scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index last year.13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports online money transfers worldwide.Leading publication Forbes has ranked the company 20th on its list of employers known for promoting diversity in the US. Furthermore, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands 45th among the world’s best employers and holds the 123rd place among the world’s top female-friendly organizations. According to GlobalData, the company has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce. Meanwhile, 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics and Latinx, and African Americans. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also have programs related to parental preparedness and Global Wellness Days to ensure employees’ well-being.Wedgewood Partners shared its outlook on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based creative, marketing, and document management software corporation.In terms of gender representation, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) claims to have 33.6% female employees in its workforce of 25,000 employees. Women occupy 27.2% of the leadership positions in the company. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is targeting the proportion to increase to 30% by 2025 and eventually achieve gender parity. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has brought in Brian Miller as the Chief Talent, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer to ensure the company meets its strategic goals. Every year since 2001, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recognized 12 employees with Adobe’s Founder Award to honor the brightest in the company through a peer-to-peer system.Here’s what Renaissance Investment Management said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the quarter. The company reported decelerating revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but more concerning was the announced acquisition of privately held Figma for a record $20 billion. While management made a compelling case for the acquisition, the price paid revived fears that Adobe is facing increasing competitive threats.”11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) customer relationship management (CRM) company.Back in 2019, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) aimed to have half of its workforce represent minority groups. The company managed to achieve this target one year earlier, as 50.7% of its employees today belong to underrepresented groups. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) intends to connect executive compensation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals to increase accountability. Progressive initiatives at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are led by Lori Castillo Martinez as the Chief Equality Officer. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has been undertaking progressive measures for a number of years now. In 2015, the company conducted an equal pay audit that resulted in a salary adjustment of $3 million.Oakmark Funds shared its outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Rogers, Arkansas-based operator of the discount department, grocery stores, and hypermarkets. The company is the biggest retailer in the world, with a headcount of over 1.6 million employees in the US alone across its 4,000 stores.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is actively making efforts to promote a progressive work culture. As of 2022, 53% of all the company’s associates in the US are women. Meanwhile, 21% of its associates are Blacks or African American. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has also launched a progressive wage structure for its pharmacy technicians to increase their hourly wage by $4 over the course of four years. In June 2022, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) increased the average hourly wage of its 36,000 pharmacy technicians to $20 per hour.Leaven Partners shared its stance on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”9. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based operator, franchisor, and licensor of lodging services comprising hotel, residential and timeshare properties.Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) launched a $50 million development program in June 2022 focused on addressing challenges related to the underrepresentation of minorities in developing and owning hotels in the North American region. The company intends to create an expected asset value of $1 billion through the development program. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has had a diversity and inclusion program for more than two decades. The company claims to have 54% of female employees in its workforce. Overall, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) intends to have 3,000 diverse-owned hotels in its portfolio by 2025.Here’s what LRT Capital Management said about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its October investor letter:“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is the world’s largest hotel company followed closely by Hilton (HLT) and Intercontinental Hotels Group plc (IHG). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Aloft), through the mid-tier (Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels), to the luxury high end (JW Marriot, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis). In total the company had 7,642 properties with over 1.4 million rooms as of the end of Q1 2021.The majority (85%) of Marriott’s revenue comes from hotels in the United States, with the rest almost evenly split between Asia Pacific and Europe. Like it’s smaller peer, Hilton, the company today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels, not a hotel owner. The company owns 66 hotels, manages 2,083 and franchises 5,493. Like all franchise-based businesses Marriott requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Marriott currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However, the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure (the company acquired Starwood Properties in late 2016) – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid, as we expect it will, the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based payment card company.As of 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has invested $1 billion in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. The company intends to spend an additional $3 billion by 2025 to promote these initiatives. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the US for the last two consecutive years. Forbes has ranked American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the 61st position in the list of employees known for promoting diversity. In March 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) also launched its Amex Flex working system to allow employees to work either in an office or virtually. Under this initiative, 40% of employees have decided to go completely virtual.7. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a McLean, Virginia-based hospitality company with a wide variety of hotels and resorts in its portfolio.According to Great Place to Work, the company has been regarded as the best organization for diversity and parents. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) provides benefits like adoption assistance, parental leave, and GED support to its associates at its properties. The company intends to achieve equal representation of both genders in leadership positions globally by 2027 and have 25% ethnic diversity in leadership roles across the US. Furthermore, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has partnered with the Atlanta, Georgia-based Morris Brown College to create a sustainable relationship with college students by establishing a $30 million hotel and hospitality training center.Here’s what Pershing Square Holdings said about Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential, led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel, with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows, and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight, Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model, and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant, results have vastly improved throughout the year as COVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus, and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months, Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

Paypal (PYPL), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This technology platform and digital payments company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.55%.For the last reported quarter, Paypal came out with earnings of $1.08 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 per share, representing a surprise of 13.68%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.93 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.41%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Paypal lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paypal has an Earnings ESP of +3.60% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.49 billion, down 7.24% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

This represents a no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.83.Meanwhile, IBM's PEG ratio is currently 2.23.

223,caf0ec8a-2cf0-34c2-84f5-521b17c1ffd5,GM,2023-01-10,2022 U.S. Auto Sales Fall to a Decade Low,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2022-u-auto-sales-fall-130501245.html,1673269501,STORY,"['TM', 'HMC', 'GM']","[Last year, sales of light vehicles in the United States dropped to their lowest level since 2012 amid severe supply chain snarls and tight inventories. Per the Automotive News, U.S. light-vehicle sales in 2022 totaled 13.4 million units. The data takes into account the automakers that have released their sales data so far, barring a few like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Jaguar Land Rover that are set to report this week. In 2021, sales of U.S. light vehicles came in at 14.9 million units approximately.The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for December 2022 was 13.59 million, the lowest level since August. To put it in perspective, prior to COVID, SAAR had topped 17 million vehicles for five straight years from 2015 to 2019. While the global pandemic rattled the auto market in 2020, the supply deficit was the number one challenge in 2021. Just when industry watchdogs and auto giants were predicting the chip deficit to gradually start easing out from mid-2022, the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine triggered the second round of global microchip shortage. The war created ripple effects in the automotive supply chain and exacerbated the chip famine as raw materials got difficult to come by. While the demand for cars remained strong, automakers could not produce enough cars. Parts shortage choked supplies and low stockpiles impacted sales.New vehicle inventory in the United States, especially in the first half of 2022, was mostly running below 1 million units. While inventories started improving in the back half of the year, they are still way below the pre-pandemic levels.Before we discuss whether the road is likely to be any smoother this year, here’s a rundown of the 2022 U.S. sales report of auto bigwigs, including General Motors GM, Ford F, Stellantis STLA, Toyota TM, Honda HMC and others.A Glance Through the Sales NumbersGeneral Motors reclaimed the U.S. auto sales crown from Toyota in 2022. The U.S. legacy automaker sold more than 2.25 million units last year, up 2.5%. While full-year sales across its Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands rose 13.9%, 5.6% and 7.3%, respectively, that of Buick tailed off 42.4% on a yearly basis.Story continuesIn fact, General Motors was the only major auto giant, which reported a year-over-year increase in sales last year (apart from the electric vehicle [EV] king Tesla).Japan’s auto giant Toyota came in second, delivering more than 2.1 million units last year. Sales contracted 9.6% from 2021 when TM defeated GM as the top-selling automaker in the United States. While sales of the namesake brand Toyota were down 8.8%, the Lexus division witnessed sales decline of 15% year over year. Importantly, RAV4 was U.S.’ best-selling SUV for the seventh straight year in 2022.GM’s close peer, Ford, sold more than 1.86 million units in 2022, inching down 2.2% year over year. While sales of cars and trucks declined 29.4% and 5.5%, respectively, SUV sales registered 4.1% growth. Importantly, F-Series maintained its position as America’s best-selling truck for 46 straight years.TM’s close peer Honda saw 2022 U.S. sales plunge 32.9% year over year to 983,507 units (with truck sales comprising 66.6% of the total volumes). Sales of the namesake brand and Acura dropped 28% and 39.2%, respectively. CR-V remained the best-selling vehicle of the firm for the 10th straight year in 2022.Stellantis’ 2022 sales slid 13% to 1.54 million units, with Jeep, RAM, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Alpha Romeo brands recording 12%, 16%, 2%, 12%, 61% and 30% fall in volumes, respectively. Sales at two of its major brands Jeep and RAM fell for the sixth straight quarter ending Dec 31, 2022.While Stellantis sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), TM and HMC carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford are currently Ranked #4 (Sell) and #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EV Sales Remain the Bright SpotWhile the overall U.S. vehicle sales were down year over year in 2022, EV sales managed to maintain momentum. More than 807,000 EVs were sold last year in the United States. It accounted for 5.8% of total vehicle sales, up from 3.2% in 2021. Tesla was the clear winner and Ford emerged as the second largest maker of green vehicles, with full-year sales hitting a record 61,575 units, rocketing 126% year over year. Hyundai Motor was a close third, selling 58,028 EVs in 2022.The EV race is only expected to get fiercer in 2023, as many new models are expected to be rolled out, including Kia EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 6 and General Motors’ Silverado EV among others. Cox Automotive expects EV sales to cross one million units in the United States for the first time this year.Inventory ImprovingInventory levels in December came in more than one million units for the third consecutive month, per J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.  Per TrueCar, the total new light-vehicle inventory, including fleet and commercial vehicles, totaled 1.8 million last month, up from 1.1 million recorded in December 2021.Cox Automotive notified that brands like Buick, RAM, Ford, Jeep, Volvo, Infiniti, Jaguar, Audi, Dodge and Lincoln Chrysler recorded the highest stockpiles last month. Meanwhile, brands including Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Subaru, Land Rover, Kia, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Acura logged the lowest inventory levels.Affordability is the Pressing Concern for 2023Just when new vehicles seem to be becoming more widely available, it’s to be seen if Americans wish to continue to splurge on these high-ticket items in the face of rising interest rates and recession worries.To rein in the stubborn inflation, Fed became ultra-aggressive, cranking up borrowing rates repeatedly in 2022. Increasing costs of vehicle financing are making monthly payments less affordable for less-affluent and subprime consumers. With borrowing getting expensive and threats of a recession looming large, consumers are gradually starting to get apprehensive on buying cars. Resultantly, vehicle sales forecasts are getting slashed and automakers’ pressing concern is now shifting from inventory challenges to rising interest rates, which may erode demand with economic downturn around the corner. It's yet to be seen if automakers resort to better incentives, sweeter financing deals and discounts to hold up demand if customers get unwilling to shell more for these discretionary items.Projections for U.S. light vehicle sales for 2023 sales range from 14.1 million to 15 million units. Well, that’s above this year but much below the pre-pandemic years. Edmunds estimates 14.8 million cars and trucks to be sold in the United States in 2023, well below the sales that automakers were registering in the previous decade.Per a senior economist at Cox Automotive, much of the pent-up demand from the limited supply is gradually disappearing as high interest rates eat away vehicle buyers' willingness and ability to purchase. So, will the supply crunch morph into a demand slowdown in 2023? Quite likely.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned +5.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, indicating a change of -55.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 points to a change of -59.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.61 indicates a change of +73.5% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $108.43 billion and $111.58 billion estimates indicate +2.3% and +2.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WMT has been committed to enhancing its delivery services to make the most of the growing online shopping trend. The omnichannel retailer recently unveiled that it completed its expansion agenda for 2022. Walmart (along with its vendors) now operates 36 drone delivery centers across Arizona, Arkansas, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Florida.The company stated that it has conducted more than 6,000 deliveries to customers within 30 minutes over the past year and remains encouraged about making progress in 2023. Presently, about 85% of items in a Walmart Neighborhood Market qualify for the drone delivery criteria in terms of weight and volume.All said, Walmart is set to provide drone delivery services to more customers in the years to come due to the positive response.

We note that as of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart U.S. had 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,900 same-day delivery stores.U.S. e-commerce sales rose 16% in the third quarter and increased 24% on a two-year stack basis.

In the International segment, e-commerce sales advanced by 17%.Walmart’s e-commerce business and omnichannel penetration have been increasing, all the more amid the pandemic-led social distancing. From the fiscal 2021 beginning to the fiscal 2022 end, the company’s digital sales as a percentage of sales increased from 6% to 13%. Walmart has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.WMT has taken robust strides to strengthen its delivery arm. These include its expansion of the InHome delivery service, investments in DroneUp, a pilot with HomeValet, the introduction of Carrier Pickup by FedEx, the launch of the Walmart+ membership program, drone delivery pilots in the United States with Flytrex and Zipline and a pilot with Cruise to test grocery delivery through self-driven all-electric cars.Prior to the abovementioned activities, Walmart unveiled Express Delivery and joined forces with Point Pickup, Roadie and Postmates alongside acquiring Parcel to enhance its delivery service.The abovementioned upsides paint a bright picture of Walmart’s growth story.

237,77cff1a6-ebae-359a-b261-d2935defa6b1,ADI,2023-01-10,"A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-analog-devices-120027668.html,1673352027,STORY,['ADI'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.71bUS$5.07bUS$5.46bUS$6.12bUS$6.58bUS$6.93bUS$7.22bUS$7.48bUS$7.71bUS$7.93bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.27%Est @ 4.28%Est @ 3.59%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.77% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.0%) = US$108bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$108b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$44bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$83b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$167, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Analog Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.248. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Analog DevicesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

And the Fed is being quite clear with its message - that rates are going to push higher and they’re going to stay higher for longer,"" CityIndex strategist Fiona Cincotta said.""If we look at expectations of inflation later this week - the big focus – core inflation is still expected to remain high. It doesn't matter which way you look at it. It's still higher than the target the Fed is aiming for,"" she said.U.S. consumer price data, due on Thursday, is expected to show headline inflation slowed to 6.5% in December from 7.1% in November.The data could be key to setting expectations for what happens with rates at the Fed's next policy meeting and beyond.Story continuesSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Wall Street Journal she would pay close attention to Thursday's data and both 25- and 50-basis point hikes were options for her. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said his ""base case"" was for no rate cuts this year or next.""The main theme overnight was cautiousness in the equity space as stocks pared gains after hawkish comments from two Fed officials. Raphael Bostic and Mary Daly said the Fed would likely hike (interest) rates to above 5% and hold them there for some time,"" Commerzbank said in a note.Fed Chair Jerome Powell addresses a conference on central bank independence later on Tuesday and investors will likely scour his remarks for any signal on monetary policy.""Given that the recent rebound in equity markets and fall in bond yields and the US dollar is loosening financial conditions, today might offer an opportunity for Fed chairman Jay Powell to reset the narrative slightly,"" CMC Markets chief strategist Michael Hewson said.FRAGILE CHINAIn Europe, the STOXX 600, which on Monday hit its highest in eight months, fell 0.7%, led by a decline in industrials. London's FTSE 100 lost 0.2%, while Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.5%.U.S. stock index futures fell 0.3%, indicating Wall Street could open a touch lower after a volatile session the previous day.The dollar carved out gains against the Australian dollar , which is highly sensitive to the Chinese economy and has gained 3.5% in the last three weeks alone, based on the optimism around reopening.The Aussie was last down 0.5% at $0.6877, while the offshore yuan lost 0.1% against the dollar to trade around 6.7913. It reached its strongest level since mid-August the previous day.The dollar index rose 0.2%. The euro was flat, while the pound fell 0.3%. The yen fell 0.1% against the dollar to 132.06, even after data showed a faster pick-up in Tokyo inflation that could prompt the Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy more quickly.Strategists at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, on Tuesday said they expected the Chinese economy to grow by 6% this year, which should cushion the global slowdown as recession hits developed-market economies. But any bounce may be fleeting.""We don’t expect the level of economic activity in China to return to its pre-COVID trend, even as domestic activity restarts. We see growth falling back once the restart runs its course,"" Wei Li, who is global chief investment strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a note.Copper eased back from six-month highs, as bullishness from China's emergence from COVID-19 was offset by concern about the risks of a broader global downturn.London Metal Exchange copper futures fell 0.5% to $8,813 a tonne, having hit their highest in over six months on Monday, while zinc fell 0.7% and lead dropped 2%.Oil pared earlier losses, but concern persisted that China returning to more normal activity may not translate into a boom in energy demand.""The social vitality of major Chinese cities is rapidly recovering, and the restart of China's demand is worth looking forward to. However, considering that the recovery of consumption is still at the expected stage, the oil price will most likely remain low and range-bound,"" analysts from Haitong Futures said.Brent crude futures were last up 0.4% to $80.00 a barrel. The oil price is about 2.3% below where it was a year ago and 45% below the highs around $139 after Russia invaded Ukraine last February.(Additional reporting by Selena Li in Hong Kong; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, Angus MacSwan and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said his ""base case"" was for no rate cuts this year or next.""The main theme overnight was cautiousness in the equity space as stocks pared gains after hawkish comments from two Fed officials.

It reached its strongest level since mid-August the previous day.The dollar index eased 0.21%. The euro edged up 0.1%, while the pound fell 0.1%. The yen rose 0.1% against the dollar to 132.04, after data showed a faster pick-up in Tokyo inflation that could prompt the Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy more quickly.Strategists at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, on Tuesday said they expected the Chinese economy to grow by 6% this year, which should cushion the global slowdown as recession hits developed-market economies. But any bounce may be fleeting.""We don’t expect the level of economic activity in China to return to its pre-COVID trend, even as domestic activity restarts. We see growth falling back once the restart runs its course,"" Wei Li, who is global chief investment strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a note.Copper eased back from six-month highs, as bullishness from China's emergence from COVID-19 was offset by concern about the risks of a broader global downturn.London Metal Exchange copper futures were down 0.9% at $8,785 a tonne, having hit their highest in over six months on Monday, while aluminium and zinc fell between 1-1.4%.Oil was under pressure from concern that China resuming more normal activity may not translate into a boom in demand.""The social vitality of major Chinese cities is rapidly recovering, and the restart of China's demand is worth looking forward to. However, considering that the recovery of consumption is still at the expected stage, the oil price will most likely remain low and range-bound,"" analysts from Haitong Futures said.Brent crude futures were last down 0.6% at $79.16 a barrel.

These storms have delivered heavy rain, strong winds and snow. Communities in Northern California are dealing with floods, debris flows, road closures, downed trees and commercial power outages. With safety as its top priority, Verizon is committed to making sure customers can use their mobile devices when it matters most.Verizon’s extreme network is recognized for reliability and designed to withstand extreme weather with redundancy on critical paths and components to continue to serve its customers to deliver superior service. Battery and generator backup systems in critical locations – such as macro cell sites, switch locations and network-operation centers – also minimize the risk of disruption if commercial power is lost. Verizon engineers also ensure all cell-site generator fuel levels are high, test battery back-ups at network facilities, and train emergency crews to respond quickly to any network issue. The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team has deployed to several communities in Northern California to provide mission-critical communications support to public safety agencies responding to the ongoing severe weather. The team is in contact with city and county emergency management teams and is currently coordinating communication needs and efforts with the public safety agencies operating in the region. The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team has now deployed more than 30 Verizon Frontline solutions including two Satellite Picocells on Trailers (SPOTs) in support of emergency response operations.  Verizon Frontline is the advanced network and technology built for first responders – developed over three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies - to meet their unique and evolving needs.Story continuesThe Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to government agencies, emergency responders, nonprofits and communities on a 24/7 basis at no cost to the supported agencies.

Convenient options like locker, curbside and instore pickup also provide quick ways to get in and out.In addition to the right tech, customers will also want to take steps to ensure their families are prepared for power outages, flooding and other weather events.Keep devices dry: While many phones today have some degree of water resistance, you’ll want to ensure phones, tablets, batteries, chargers and other equipment remain dry and accessible. Plastic zipper storage bags help shield devices, as do weatherproof phones, cases and other protective accessories.Keep devices fully charged: Make sure devices are ready by keeping phone and tablet batteries fully charged.Get some backup: When power is out for an extended period of time, portable battery packs and car chargers can become critical to staying connected.Create a list: Keep a list of emergency numbers so that they are easily accessible.Be prepared for loss: Take pictures of valuables and other important belongings for possible insurance claims. And make sure they’re uploaded to the cloud as a backup.Review checklists: Review the Flood Safety Checklist recommendations and other resources from the American Red Cross.Download useful apps: There are plenty of free apps for public safety alerts, weather, news, and safety-related available for download.Verizon Communications Inc.

The December 2021 FAA directive relied on the voluntary agreement.Some international airlines have privately expressed reluctance to install filters absent a legal requirement from the FAA, officials told Reuters.Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and others, said ""carriers are working diligently to ensure fleets are equipped with compliant radio altimeters, but global supply chains continue to lag behind current demand. Any government deadline must consider this reality.""Wireless group CTIA said ""the FAA’s schedule for altimeter updates is reasonable and practical. 5G in the C-band coexists safely with air traffic.""FAA acting Administrator Billy Nolen in October sought a delay in some 5G C-Band transmissions from smaller operators over aviation safety concerns.Story continuesNolen said in an Oct. 21 letter the agency wanted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to mandate the voluntary mitigations AT&amp;T and Verizon had agreed to earlier this year to 19 smaller telecoms and other spectrum holders.Airline CEOs in January 2022 had warned of an impending ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could ground almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment.A deal struck shortly before a 2022 deadline did not prevent dozens of foreign carriers from canceling international flights to the United States.

This stock has been absolutely hammered over the past year. The last 12 months, it's down nearly 45%. A little more.But today, it's actually having a good day. Up around 6%, I believe. Basically, what's going on here is it got a top pick from Wells Fargo, as well as Credit Suisse. Both of them in different ways.Wells Fargo is looking at the data center business for the company, essentially saying that they expect to see that kind of get increased in 2023. While Credit Suisse is looking at the gaming side seeing increases. It's worth pointing out that Wells Fargo also added AMD to its top pick list.Look, Nvidia has a huge market when it comes to the data center business. It's beating out the gaming business by a mile at this point, especially as we saw the gaming business get hurt because of those rough comparisons between 2020, 2021, and then 2022. The gaming industry just suffered massively as a result.But we're starting to come around on those comparisons. We should start to see it rebound in 2023. And I think that's really what these companies are looking at.DAVE BRIGGS: And AMD, Dan, also up about 6%, perhaps, on this same news. It was last month the UBS picked AMD, Nvidia, and Micron, top semiconductor stocks for '23. But Citi also out with a note most recently saying they expect semi sales down 10% in the quarter. That's up from their previous prediction of 7%. So the news has been mixed, if anything.And we thought that CHIPS Act was going to be a real catalyst for the whole industry. Really has turned out to be anything but. But perhaps in the long run, they'll be right here.]"

In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In a tough 2022, these 25 companies have on average loss of 6.6% in market cap, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index by double digits.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Air Products and Chemicals'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is:16% = US$2.3b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, Air Products and Chemicals seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 18%. This probably goes some way in explaining Air Products and Chemicals' moderate 12% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Air Products and Chemicals' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Air Products and Chemicals''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Air Products and Chemicals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 62% (or a retention ratio of 38%) for Air Products and Chemicals suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Air Products and Chemicals has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 56%. However, Air Products and Chemicals' ROE is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Air Products and Chemicals' performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Walt Disney's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walt Disney is:3.3% = US$3.6b ÷ US$108b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Walt Disney's Earnings Growth And 3.3% ROEIt is quite clear that Walt Disney's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 9.8%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. For this reason, Walt Disney's five year net income decline of 40% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Walt Disney's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 23% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is DIS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether DIS is currently mispriced by the market.Is Walt Disney Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Walt Disney. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

The company launched its streaming service, Disney+, just in time for the pandemic, and cashed in on a surge in viewing as people around the world were stuck at home.Its subscriber base has since grown at a blistering pace, and last year overtook Netflix for subscriber numbers for the first time.But more recently, the shine has begun to wear off. Like most of the industry, Disney is now contending with a proliferation of rival streaming services, a deepening cost-of-living crisis and surging production costs that threaten to bring the boom to an abrupt halt.Disney’s shares dropped by around 45pc last year – the biggest fall in nearly half a century – wiping more than $100bn off its market value.Story continuesOn the big screen, Disney has also suffered a number of recent flops that have prompted soul-searching at the media giant, which is trying to set out its store in the streaming age.Strange World, an animated drama starring Jake Gyllenhaal, notched up Disney’s worst opening weekend in more than two decades over Thanksgiving, putting it on track to lose $100m during its limited theatrical run.Disney also suffered a flop with Lightyear, a much-hyped Toy Story spin-off that failed to take off with audiences.While Avatar: The Way of the Water has grossed more than $1.7bn at the box office so far, helping to prop up Disney’s overall performance, analysts are still concerned about its run of recent misses.At the heart of this lacklustre run is a dearth of originality. Disney has leant heavily on sequels such as the critically-panned Avatar follow-up and Frozen II. Lightyear relied on intellectual property dating back almost three decades to 1995.Avatar: The Way of the Water - 20th Century StudiosNot since the release of Moana and Pixar’s Coco in 2016 and 2017 respectively has Disney enjoyed significant box office success with an original title.A spokesman denied that Disney was lacking in new intellectual property and said the company topped last year's global box office at $4.9bn, owning four of the top 10 highest-grossing films.Part of this trend of returning to sequels can be pinned on Disney’s laser-like focus on streaming, which has prompted the company to make ever-tougher demands for new instalments from popular franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel.By focusing its resources on streaming, Disney risks taking the shine off the cinematic blockbusters that were once its forte.But by calling staff back to the office, Iger has also sent out a clear warning that the shift to flexible working – which was so crucial to Disney’s success during the pandemic – has now become a curb on creativity.The approach reflects concerns elsewhere in the creative industries, which rely heavily on office life for collaborative work that sparks new ideas.Iger's distaste for the fracturing of Disney’s business has also been borne out in his decision to scrap the company’s media and entertainment distribution unit – a division set up under his predecessor Bob Chapek to centralise film and television sales and distribution.Announcing the move last year, Iger said the move would place more power back in the hands of creatives, adding: “I fundamentally believe storytelling is what fuels this company and it belongs at the centre of how we organise our business.”Enders Analysis said the decision to take investment power away from creative executives was unpopular and the structure was “unwieldy and unworkable”.The analysts added: “Disney needs to recapture the content and creative-friendly elan that Iger has been so famous for, but in a faltering economy with a keen eye on costs.”But in his pursuit for creativity, Iger is also facing a balancing act. Media analyst Ian Whittaker says there is “probably a degree of truth” in Iger’s statements, but warns the boss faces a tough challenge trying to win over staff.“Bob Iger is likely to fail here, especially given the composition of Disney’s workforce, and there were signs of dissatisfaction,” he says.The call back to the office also comes as Iger tries to unravel a series of controversies. In 2021, Scarlett Johansson sued Disney, accusing the company of breach of contract after her film Black Widow was released on Disney+ alongside a theatrical release.The media giant was then embroiled in a row over its response to legislation in Florida dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which limits classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity.More recently, Disney has clashed with unions amid complaints about pay and working conditions for its theme park staff, which it calls cast members – a row fuelled by Abigail Disney, a grandniece of Walt Disney who has been vocal in her criticisms of the company.“Personally, my view is this is not the smartest hill to die upon,” Whittaker says. “It risks raising tensions and dissatisfaction over a policy that has little change of working.”But after his return to the helm, Iger has made his position clear – efforts to sprinkle fresh pixie dust onto the House of Mouse, and drag its share price out of the doldrums, will begin in the office.]"

Now, the first full weekend earning an estimated $104 million at the box office. That's up 60% from the first weekend of 2022. Joining us now with a full roundup is Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal. Allie, lots of expectations just in terms of Avatar's new movie, how many people are going to go out and see that. It seems like some of that momentum has continued into the new year.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Definitely. And I think there were two big movies that were driving a lot of the attendance this past weekend. You mentioned the Avatar sequel. And ""The Way of Water"" does continue to do what analysts said it was going to do, ride that momentum, keep breaking records. Currently, the movie has earned more than $1.7 billion globally in its first four weekends. That makes it the seventh highest grossing film in history, with even more room to run. Director James Cameron, he said he fully expects this movie to surpass that coveted $2 billion mark.Now, that's been very hard for films to do amid this pandemic era. Even a film like ""Spider-Man No Way Home,"" despite all of its success, came in just shy of that $2 billion number. But the expectation is that Avatar will surpass that. And that's great news for James Cameron because that is the break even number that this film had to nab in order to make some money. So I think we can expect more equals of this franchise in the future.And then I also want to call out ""M3GAN."" This film surprised me. And I was talking to our producer Cheyenne about this. She went to go see it. She absolutely loved it. The reviews have been amazing, off the charts. Near-perfect critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. A lot of activity on TikTok because of this. And if we take a look at the numbers here, $30.2 million domestically, bringing the global total to $45 million. And the expectation was that in the domestic markets, it would secure just $17 to $20 million.Story continuesSo it nearly doubled that. And it's just interesting to see the momentum of the horror genre. We saw Paramount's ""Smile"" perform really well. I think this is something that we could see continue into 2023, especially since we do have some pretty prominent horror films coming to the box office this year, like ""Scream 6,"" which I personally am very excited about.- Oh no. Is that really happening?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I love the Scream franchise. Heck yeah it's happening.- Oh my goodness. I had not heard of ""M3GAN."" So I guess I'm not watching enough television.ALEXANDRA CANAL: A lot of younger kids are into it. So that's something that I think could have more momentum.- All right. On television, that old fashioned thing that some of us still watch, the Golden Globes are back tomorrow. Is it still relevant? Does it still matter?ALEXANDRA CANAL: You're asking the question that I think a lot of Hollywood is asking right now. And NBC is asking this as well because they only signed a one-year contract with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, otherwise known as HFPA, following that intense scandal in 2021. But ratings have just been on a downward trajectory. In February 2021, this was the last time that we got a live telecast of the Globes. Ratings hit a 13-year low of 6.9 million viewers. And if we compare that to pre-pandemic times, January 2020, ratings came in at 18.3 million.So a very steep fall from grace there. And I think a large part of that had to do with that controversy, the ""LA Times"" publishing a scathing expose against the HFPA detailing allegations of self-dealing, bullying, racism within the organization. And that really convinced a lot of A-listers to pull back, studios to pull back. Since then, the HFPA has enacted some sweeping reforms such as a new board of directors, diversity and inclusion programs. But is it too little too late? And I think the ratings will show us that tomorrow night? But a Tuesday versus a Sunday, I don't have high hopes for this.- Largely speaking, it just feels like we're in a post-awards ceremony era.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Totally. It's very different from years past.- Yeah. Just people don't care as much. But 6 million viewers ain't bad in this era of live viewers. Allie Canal, thank you. Good stuff.]"

But they might see him as more of a scar, or Jafar, today. Iger, who's already signaled cost cutting, will be top of mind in the new year. Now says it's time to return to the office. Starting March 1, employees are expected to be back four days a week. The boss writing in a memo obtained by Yahoo Finance, quote, ""In a creative business like ours, nothing can replace the ability to connect, observe, create with peers that comes from being physically together, nor the opportunity to grow professionally by learning from leaders and mentors."" Seana, your reaction.SEANA SMITH: You know, it's going to be interesting to see what the employees' reaction is because we have cited study after study saying how important it is for workers to have that flexibility. They want to work from home. There was a recent ZipRecruiter survey out saying that employees are willing to take a 14% pay cut just to be able to work from home. So I think the big question here is, who has the upper hand? Is it still the employee, which has certainly been the case leading up until now because we hiring has been so challenging, quitting has been so popular.That dynamic, though, is starting to shift. And it seems like the employer is going to have and will have the upper hand as we do-- potentially, the economic backdrop continues to worsen. They are forced to do layoffs. Employees won't be able to ask for what they had in the past. They won't be able to get away with what they've been getting away with in the past if, in fact, their bosses, management wants everyone back to the office.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that same study showed you're three times more likely-- you'll get three times as many applicants for remote work as you will in office. I think there's a real test of the very signature quality that everyone hailed when Bob Iger came back. It's that deft personal touch in handling employees and handling the media and handling politicians. My presumption is that if the same statement came from Bob Chapek, it would probably not be taken as well as it might be from Bob Iger. But that's part of why they brought him back.Story continuesNow the actual statement that he wrote in that email, I have to agree with spot on. What he needs is collaboration. What he needs is employees learning from mentors, people seeing each other face-to-face and building on that. And quite frankly, from this seat, four days a week sounds awfully nice, right?SEANA SMITH: It does, and being able to work from home one day a week would work for me.DAVE BRIGGS: Now, it doesn't sound great-- yeah, it doesn't sound great to a lot of those that are used to the two and three-day. But look, you're still getting a full day at home, working from remote, which is more than you probably ever thought possible prior to the pandemic. So we'll see how employees react, to your point. That will be--SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think it makes them very strong case, but we'll see. I don't know how they're going to react.DAVE BRIGGS: It's gonna be interesting.]"

(Helping Others Obtain Destiny) in the city’s West Woodlawn neighborhood. ComEd’s collaboration with Project H.O.O.D. took place during the organization’s regular food giveaway and provided families access to a number of agencies – including ComEd representatives – who could help with bill-assistance and career planning.This event, and the new customer-assistance options introduced, were informed by a ComEd-commissioned study that looked at how to support customers in light of CEJA’s ambitious goals for creating an equitable transition to a decarbonized future. This work helped ComEd better understand the inequities that have long impacted many of our communities, the barriers people within these communities face, and identify opportunities to help these individuals overcome these barriers. The study was conducted by ILLUME Advising and IEc, national policy experts that have done similar studies for states like California and New York and have a deep and broad understanding of disadvantaged communities. This is the first time an energy company has commissioned a study of this type.The research team conducted interviews with more than two dozen community stakeholders. Along with this research, these interviews helped the team understand how ComEd could increase its impact by collaborating with existing community networks to bolster awareness of assistance options available and help provide skills and training in next-generation technologies to support communities’ workforce of the future. Additionally, the study identified barriers and opportunities ComEd cannot directly address but can advocate for in partnership with other organizations and regulators to break down those barriers.Story continues""To better anticipate the changing needs of the communities ComEd serves, we’ve spoken to a number of local leaders and public officials, including Chicago Mayor Lightfoot who is looking to businesses like ComEd to join forces to create solutions,"" said Gil C.

(NYSE: OKE) today announced that it has reached an agreement with its insurers to settle all claims for physical damage and business interruption related to the Medford incident that occurred in July 2022.Under the terms of the settlement agreement, ONEOK agreed to resolve its claim for total insurance payments of $930 million, including $100 million received to date. The outstanding settlement payment is required to be paid by the insurers within 45 days. The proceeds will serve as settlement for property damage and as a payment in lieu of future business interruption insurance claims.With the insurance claim now resolved, the company is also announcing plans to construct a new 125,000-barrel per day (bpd) NGL fractionator at its Mont Belvieu, Texas, facility. Upon completion, the new fractionator, MB-6, will increase the company's total fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu to approximately 700,000 bpd and better align ONEOK's fractionation capacity with NGL market demand in the Gulf Coast.Additionally, the MB-6 fractionator will produce purity ethane instead of an ethane/propane (E/P) mix previously produced at the Medford facility. The new 125,000 bpd MB-6 fractionator would be equivalent to approximately 185,000 bpd of capacity at the Medford facility. The demand for E/P mix has decreased while the demand for purity ethane has increased in the Gulf Coast, causing much of the Medford E/P mix to be transported south and split into purity ethane and propane consuming capacity at ONEOK's existing Mont Belvieu facilities. ONEOK's E/P mix output from the remaining Mid-Continent fractionation facilities at Bushton, Hutchinson and Conway is expected to be enough to meet market demand.Construction of MB-6 is expected to be completed in approximately 24 months at a total cost of approximately $550 million and has a more favorable completion schedule when compared with rebuilding at Medford due to the following:Story continuesPermitting for the MB-6 facility is complete by applicable regulatory agencies;Engineering is substantially complete due to the ability to utilize similar engineering designs and purchase orders from the two previous fractionation facilities, MB-5 and MB-4; andThe company's ability to efficiently transition the existing construction resources at ONEOK's MB-5 fractionator to the MB-6 fractionator.MB-5, having a capacity of 125,000 bpd, remains on schedule to be completed early in the second quarter 2023 thus reducing the current need for third-party fractionation through the rebuild process.ONEOK will continue to operate NGL pipeline assets in Medford along with existing offices for regional operations. In addition, ONEOK is preserving assets for future potential NGL facilities that could be constructed in Medford to enhance its NGL business as the market evolves.""We are pleased to have come to a successful agreement with our insurance carriers that was the result of a collaborative process,"" said Pierce H. Norton II, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. ""This agreement provides us the certainty of insurance recovery, and shortens the construction period to restore the most efficient fractionation capacity to our integrated system to meet expected growth in NGL supply for petrochemical and export demand.""When the insurance proceeds are received, the company expects to apply cash from the settlement payment to the balance of any insurance receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and record a gain for the remaining settlement proceeds in the first quarter 2023.ONEOK, Inc.

The North American energy infrastructure company will shell out $1.05 billion in cash for the transaction, a portion of which will come from its recent note offerings. Upon completion of the deal — expected sometime in the first quarter — TRGP will have full ownership of the Permian Basin conduit.The Grand Prix Pipeline can transport gathering and processing volumes of up to 1 million barrels per day from Targa Resources’ Permian Basin positions in West Texas and central Oklahoma to its Mont Belvieu fractionation and export facilities. Investors should know that TRGP farmed out 25% of the Grand Prix Pipeline to funds managed by Blackstone in 2017.   Per the midstream services provider, the pipeline commenced full operations in the third quarter of 2019 and has since bettered expectations consistently. The Blackstone pact will help to simplify Targa Resources’ operations and, at the same time, augment its fee-based cash flow stream.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksTarga Resources — which primarily derives its revenues from gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas — currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).          Meanwhile, investors interested in the energy sector might look at operators like Murphy USA MUSA, Helmerich &amp; Payne HP and Patterson-UTI Energy PTEN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), currently.

289,c42bbd92-0921-3471-89b3-c8ecac962fbf,CL,2023-01-10,15 Companies That Still Test on Animals in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-companies-still-test-animals-014537588.html,1673315137,STORY,"['PG', 'JNJ', 'CHD', 'UL', 'MMM', 'URBN', 'CL']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 companies that still test on animals in 2022. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 companies that still test on animals in 2022.There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the use of animals in testing, particularly for products such as cosmetics and household cleaning products. Some people argue that testing on animals is necessary in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these products, while others argue that it is unethical to subject animals to such testing, and that alternative methods should be used instead.Many companies test on animals to ensure that their products are safe for human use. Before products are sold to the general public, companies need to ensure that their cosmetics are both properly labelled and safe. In the U.S., this is regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. While the act doesn't tell companies to use animals for testing their products, it is often the only natural conclusion to fulfil the requirements of the Act. Hence, animal testing is used by these companies to ensure that their products can be used or consumed by humans.This is an issue for companies in various industries, including cosmetics, pharmaceutical and medical research laboratories. Various products be it makeup items, medicine and shampoos to surgical procedures are first tested on animals. While this may seem necessary, it is important to note that this often falls under animal cruelty, due to the effects of this testing on animals. According to the Humane Society International, more than 115 million animals are used in testing every single year worldwide. Even if these tests are classified as ""mild"", there is a strong chance that animals are likely to face not just physical but mental distress and suffering, while some of the harsher treatments can cause irreparable damage. Many animals are often even killed at the end of experiments.Story continues15 companies that still test on animals in 2022Kingcraft/Shutterstock.comWhile many people may argue that animal testing is necessary and people are being overly sensitive, you might change your mind if you knew about some of the experiments that are conducted, such as forced chemical exposure to determine toxicity testing including forced-feeding, exposure to drugs or chemicals which can result in severe physical harm and even death, manipulation of genes, infliction of wounds, infliction of pain and even behavioral experiments. In plain words, this is pure torture of animals which is illegal in every way, except when companies are able to lobby and get exemptions.Nowadays, investors don't just want to learn about the financial performance of a company, but also their contribution to society, which is where the term ESG comes in. ESG refers to environmental, society and governance and focuses on the non-financial contributions of a company. Many organizations are now lobbying for avoiding investing in companies which test products on animals, because that is the only way that companies will consider minimizing or completely eliminating animal testing. Such organizations include PETA, which states that ""cruelty-free investing means investing in companies, mutual funds, bonds, and other investment vehicles that do not support, cause, or contribute to animal exploitation and suffering, including the destruction of natural habitats.""PETA even maintains an exhaustive database which shows companies which test on animals, making it easier for potential investors to avoid such companies. Some examples of companies which have focused on non-animal testing include Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). One of the largest FMCG companies in the world, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has been implementing non-animal testing for decades now. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) also consistently publishes its work in this regard and collaborates with others to ensure that everyone is able to implement similar practices. The company has also been involved in working on regulatory changes that will lead to a decline in animal testing, and some of its brands have been certified by PETA as well. The company has also been involved in calling for a global ban on animal testing by 2023, as some of its products still have to be tested on animals to comply with local regulations, while it has maintained its stance that such testing is not necessary.Some states in the U.S. have also started to implement tougher regulations in this respect, and in 2022, the state of New York banned cosmetics animal testing which is the 10th such state in the country to do this. Worldwide, there are now 42 national bans in addition to 12 states banning the practice in Brazil.All of this is possible due to improvements in technology, which have made non-animal testing a real possibility. These technologies include a combination of 3D printing, robotics, computer models, microengineering and human cell, organs and tissues. There are several companies which are leading the way here, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), one of the largest healthcare companies by market cap, which purchased Advanced Bioprocessing for $477 million in 2018. With bans on animal testing increasing, and governments providing support to companies which are working on non-animal testing, this industry could see stratospheric growth and investing in it now might be a very viable possibility.Of course, many other companies have continued to test on animals despite the backlash. Recently, Neuralink, owned by everyone's favorite villain in Elon Musk, has been in the news for an investigation regarding its animal testing practices after allegations that more than 1,000 animals were killed by the company during rushed brain chip experiments. This should come as no surprise for a company owned by a person who considers laws and regulations as suggestions and believes money to be above everything else. There are many other such companies as well, which we'll mention below. Our list has been devised from PETA's directory which maintains extensive records regarding animal testing. So let's take a look at the companies that may end up on the wrong side of history if they don't change their ways, starting with number 15:15. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the biggest FMCG companies, with several of its brands earning more than $1 billion in revenue each every single year. While The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been working with PETA and the Humane Society International, some of its products are still tested on animals because of local regulations. Some of the brands owned by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which engage in animal testing according to PETA include Always, Bounty, Christina Aguilera Perfumes and Gillette, among others.14. BIC GroupBIC is one of the largest producers of lighters, stationery and shavers. While the company states that it is working with experts to evaluate alternative solutions to animal testing, it still engages in animal testing if alternates can't guarantee product safety for commercial use, and if aniaml testing is required by law.13. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)While PETA lists Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) as “working toward regulatory changes to reduce the number of animals used for testing”, this does not mean that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is cruelty-free. In fact, according to Logical Harmony, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) still tests on animals where required by law.12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)3M Company (NYSE:MMM) producers over 36,000 different items and engages in animal testing where necessary. Despite pressure by several organizations, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the companies that still tests on animals in 2022.11. Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN)Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) is a major retail corporation with operations in dozens of countries. Several brands owned by Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), including Free People and Anthropologie, sell animal-derived materials, which according to PETA, are always a product of extreme violence.10. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, which states that it doesn't engage in animal testing. However, in 2012, PETA filed a resolution asking Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to ""use non-animal methods for medical device training and to incorporate them consistently throughout the company’s operations."" This was opposed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stating that existing policies already covered what PETA proposed.9. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) states that it is fully committed to not testing on animals, but does so where required by law. Some of Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.'s (NYSE:CHD) brands where animal testing takes place include Aim, Arm &amp; Hammer and Arrid among others.8. S.C. Johnson &amp; SonS.C. Johnson &amp; Son is the reason why the Johnson family is one of the wealthiest families in the world. The company manufactures cleaning supplies and some of its brands including Fantastik and Glade are engaged in animal testing, which is why it is unfortunately among the companies which still test on animals in 2022.8. Reckitt BenckiserAccording to PETA, some of Reckitt's brands which engage in animal testing include Lysol, Old English and Veet.7. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)While The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) claims that it stopped testing its products on animals, PETA mentions that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is the owner of several subsidiaries some of which still test on animals.6.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue. We initially consulted Fortune 500 to get the 25 biggest New York companies by revenue and then determined their latest market cap according to Yahoo Finance.

These curtailments are estimated to limit Devon’s production to an average of 636,000 Boe per day in the fourth quarter, including 316,000 barrels per day of oil.The most significant production impact was associated with the company’s Williston Basin operations. Severe weather conditions during December resulted in well shut-ins, facility downtime and delays in completion activity. Devon has successfully restored the affected production across all its operating areas and expects the weather-related downtime to be confined to the fourth quarter.ABOUT DEVON ENERGYDevon Energy is a leading oil and gas producer in the U.S. with a premier multi-basin portfolio headlined by a world-class acreage position in the Delaware Basin.

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Declines: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 772 in the week ended Jan 6. The figure is lower than the prior week’s count. The tally increased in five of the prior 10 weeks. The current national rig count is, however, higher than the year-ago level of 588.The onshore rigs in the week ended Jan 6 totaled 754, lower than the prior week's count of 762. In offshore resources, 16 rigs were operating, higher than the prior week’s count of 15.U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls: The oil rig count was 618 in the week ended Jan 6, lower than the prior-week figure of 621. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is, however, up from the year-ago figure of 481.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Decreases: Natural gas rig count of 152 is lower than the prior-week figure of 156. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 107. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.5% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 26 units, lower than the prior-week count of 27. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 746 is lower than the prior-week level of 752.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Rises: GoM rig count was 16 units, all oil-directed. The count was higher than the prior-week number of 15.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 350, flat with the prior week's count. The tally increased in three of the previous four weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $70-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders.

The top line missed the consensus mark by 0.8% but increased 26% year over year.The company's earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 25 of the trailing 27 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has declined to $2.85 per share from $2.88 in the past 60 days. The projection indicates a 49.2% increase from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.91 per share. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.99 billion, suggesting a rise of 19.1% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.Factors at PlayRevenues: KB Home’s housing revenues are expected to have increased in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year ago, given the strong backlog level. Also, a solid return-focused growth model is likely to have aided the company’s top line. The company expects housing revenues in the range of $1.95-$2.05 billion, up from the year-ago figure of $1.67 billion.KB Home Price and EPS Surprise KB Home Price and EPS SurpriseKB Home price-eps-surprise | KB Home Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Homebuilding revenues — including housing and land — is pegged at $1,989 million, indicating an increase of 19.2% from the year-ago period’s levels. Within Homebuilding, the consensus mark for housing revenues is pegged at $1,987 million, calling for a rise of 19.7% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. The same for land revenues is pegged at $2.52 million, indicating a significant decrease from $9.46 million in the year-ago quarter.Although home prices have started moderating in the past few months, still it is expected to have contributed to the growth. KBH anticipates average selling price or ASP to be $503,000. The consensus estimate for the ASP is $497,000, indicating growth from $451,000 reported a year ago.The consensus estimate for homes delivered is pegged at 3,977 units, suggesting a rise from the year-ago quarter’s level of 3,679 units.Margins: Although higher material and labor costs are likely to have put pressure on the bottom line, higher ASP are likely to have expanded margins in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, initiatives like the Returns-Focused Growth Plan and Built-to-Order approach are likely to have somewhat offset those headwinds.The company expects the homebuilding operating margin (excluding the impact of any inventory-related charges) to improve to 16.7% for the quarter, suggesting an increase from 12.9% a year ago.Assuming no inventory-related charges, KB Home expects fiscal fourth-quarter housing gross margin in the range of 25-26% versus 22.4% reported a year ago. The SG&amp;A expense ratio will be 8.8% of housing revenues compared with 9.8% reported in the year-ago period.Orders &amp; Backlogs: The consensus estimate for the backlog is 8,707 units, implying a notable fall from 10,544 units reported in the prior year. Also, the consensus mark for new orders is currently pegged at 1,929 units, suggesting a year-over-year decline from 3,529 units, given the ongoing affordability issues and higher mortgage rates in the industry.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for KB Home this time around.

297,142c3545-e2f6-3757-bf54-fea0b08d0067,URI,2023-01-10,4 Stocks to Buy on November's Construction Spending Rebound,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-novembers-construction-132701872.html,1673270821,STORY,"['URI', 'CRH.L', 'EXP', 'CRH', 'DY']","[Spending on construction projects started slowing at the end of the second quarter as rising interest rates have made people cautious. This has hurt the homebuilding industry the most.However, the final two months of 2022 showed signs of inflation slowing as prices cooled off. Also, spending on construction projects seems to be rising once again as spending on construction projects rebounded in November. This was primarily driven by a jump in spending on private non-residential structures.Given this scenario, stocks like Eagle Materials Inc. EXP, Dycom Industries, Inc. DY, United Rentals, Inc. URI and CRH plc CRH are likely to benefit in the near term.Construction Spending ReboundsThe U.S. Census Bureau said on Jan 3 that spending on construction projects increased 0.2% in November after declining 0.2% in October. Economists had projected an increase of 0.4%. However, the good sign is that spending has finally started rebounding after declining for two consecutive months.On a year-over-year basis, construction spending jumped 8.5% in November. Spending on private construction projects increased 0.3% in November after falling 0.7% in the prior month. Spending on non-residential private projects like gas and well-drilling climbed 1.7%.The housing market continues to suffer owing to sky-high interest rates. Investment in residential construction declined 0.5%, while single-family homes plummeted 2.9%. However, spending on multi-family housing projects jumped 2.4%, as demand for rental housing remained high.As mortgage rates continue to rise owing to steep interest rate hikes imposed by the Fed in its attempt to contain skyrocketing inflation, the homebuilding industry has been suffering the most. However, inflation is easing as recent data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose a modest 0.1% month over month in November and 4.7% on a year-over-year basis, after rising 5% in October.This has given people the feeling that inflation might be easing. Also, despite indicating more rate hikes in 2023, the Fed has finally slowed its pace of rate hikes. The Fed increased interest rates by 50 basis points in December after four straight 75 basis point rate hikes.Story continuesA slower interest rate hike is expected to boost spending on construction activity, with the homebuilding industry benefiting the most.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in construction spending. We narrowed down our search to four such stocks. Each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eagle Materials Inc. manufactures and distributes Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, Recycled Paperboard, and Oil and Gas Proppants from more than 75 facilities across the United States.

And they're expecting it could see annual revenue growth, or annual growth, rather, above 20% in the coming years.What Oracle had kind of called out or shouted out in its most recent earnings call was that the gross margin for cloud services, license support, 79% of the mix between support and cloud, Oracle license support revenue as well, that continues to hit some of those mid-90s margins.I think all in, this is a category that they're continuing to update investors about because they know the growth strength and the growth propensity that this has in the near term. But there is that license or seat count compression that continues to be one of the overhanger looming clouds over the broader cloud industry.JULIE HYMAN: Wow, huh, clouds over clouds. You know, Oracle recently, what, got that government contract, right, that had been-- Oracle has been and also ran in cloud, even though it's huge, right? But just compared with the top leaders in the industry. And it seems to be slowly chipping away at that and gaining a little strength.And this is something that Brent Bracelin, the analyst here at Piper Sandler, points out, that cloud-- that the transformation of cloud could be more durable than investors expect. And he also says Oracle Cloud revenue will eclipse database revenue by fiscal 2025, which would be a big deal for Oracle, which has been the database company, right?So it'll be interesting. He says this is going to be a watershed year. We'll see if that ends up being the case here. But it looks like the price target is set to 104 over at Piper Sandler for Oracle.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, this turnaround at Oracle has really been not talked about enough. Of course, you have Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce in this cloud mix as well. But the past four quarters in the cloud business for Oracle, I believe sales have accelerated every single quarter into the economic slowdown. And the company is gaining share. I think if you just go read the financial statements, you're not surprised by this upgrade.BRAD SMITH: And it's come on the back of some of their strategic acquisitions that they've made, too, whether that be in the marketing cloud. And you can take that back almost 10 years at this point, making the strategic acquisition of Eloqua and then, even more recently, that Cerner acquisition, too. That one that really caught a lot of investors' attention, and they continue to provide some updates around.But I think that acquired growth strategy has just, frankly, worked for them. They've made very strategic and well rounded acquisitions that are immediately accretive to the business. And if not immediately, at least, they are very transparent about that timeline as to when it will be a boon for the business. And I think that transparency has helped them out a lot as well in the Street.]"

The Micron 9400 is designed to manage the most demanding data center workloads, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) training, machine learning (ML) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The drive delivers an industry-leading 30.72 terabytes (TB) of storage capacity, superior workload performance versus the competition, and 77% improved input/output operations per second (IOPS).1 The Micron 9400 is the world’s fastest PCIe Gen4 data center U.3 drive shipping2 and delivers consistently low latency at all capacity points.3“High performance, capacity and low latency are critical features for enterprises seeking to maximize their investments in AI/ML and supercomputing systems,” said Alvaro Toledo, vice president and general manager of data center storage at Micron. “Thanks to its industry-leading 30TB capacity and stunning performance with over 1 million IOPS in mixed workloads, the Micron 9400 SSD packs larger datasets into each server and accelerates machine learning training, which equips users to squeeze more out of their GPUs.”Industry-leading 30TB capacity maximizes storage densityThe Micron 9400 SSD’s industry-leading capacity of 30TB doubles the maximum capacity of Micron’s prior-generation NVMe SSDs. A standard two-rack-unit 24-drive server loaded with 30.72TB Micron 9400 SSDs provides total storage of 737TB per server. By doubling capacity per SSD, Micron is enabling enterprises to store the same amount of data in half as many servers.This maximizes IT resources and budgets by reclaiming valuable rack space and reducing maintenance costs and time required to manage hardware — freeing up IT teams to innovate. The extreme capacity is designed to handle modern, data-intensive workloads while providing the room to scale as needed. Story continuesLeading storage performance excels in a range of environments from AI to cloudThe Micron 9400 SSD sets a new performance standard for PCIe Gen4 storage by delivering 1.6M IOPS for 100% 4K random reads.The Micron 9400’s capacity and performance enable larger datasets and accelerate epoch time, the total number of iterations of data in one cycle for training machine learning models – leading to more efficient utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs).While many SSDs are designed for pure read or write use cases, the Micron 9400 was designed with real-world applications in mind. Mixed workloads are prevalent in many data center applications, including caching, online transaction processing, high-frequency trading, AI, and performance-focused databases requiring extreme performance.For mixed read and write workloads, the Micron 9400 also outperforms the competition, providing:71% higher IOPS for 90% read and 10% write workloads, surpassing 1 million IOPS469% higher IOPS for 70% read and 30% write workloads, surpassing 940,000 IOPS4In testing scenarios, the Micron 9400 SSD excelled in mixed workload performance compared against competitors’ high-performance NVMe SSDs. The results show:For RocksDB, a storage database renowned for its high performance and used for latency-sensitive, user-sensitive applications like spam detection or storing viewer history, the 9400 delivered up to 23% higher performance and up to 34% higher workload responsiveness5For Aerospike Database, an open-source NoSQL database optimized for flash storage, the Micron 9400 demonstrated up to 2.1 times higher peak performance and superior responsiveness. Aerospike Database underpins time-critical web applications like fraud detection, recommendation engines, real-time payment processing and stock trading – meaning the 9400 can deliver faster results for these time-sensitive use cases5For NVIDIA Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage which enables a direct memory access data transfer path between GPU memory and storage, the Micron 9400 beat the competition by delivering 25% better performance in a busy system with compute-bound tasks — a critical improvement for AI environments6For multi-tenant cloud architectures, the Micron 9400 delivers more than double the overall performance of a competitor’s performance-focused SSD and up to 62% better response time6“As the world’s most innovative organizations continue to adopt cloud and digital-first strategies, WEKA and our partners are focused on removing obstacles to data-driven innovation,” said Liran Zvibel, co-founder and chief executive officer of WEKA. “High-performance, high-capacity storage like the Micron 9400 SSD provides the critical underlying technology to accelerate access to data and time to insights that drive tremendous business value.”Improved energy efficiency reduces environmental impactA major consideration for data center operators is the combination of workload performance and the amount of energy consumed. Higher energy efficiency means there is more throughput for the energy consumed to complete the work. The Micron 9400’s 77% better IOPS per watt reduces power consumption and therefore operational expenses, carbon footprint and environmental impact.“Supermicro designs innovative servers that provide maximum performance, configurability, and power savings to tackle the growing customer demand for increased capacity and efficiency,” said Wally Liaw, co-founder and senior vice president of business development at Supermicro. “The Micron 9400 SSD delivers an immense storage volume of over 30TB into every drive while simultaneously supporting optimized workloads and faster system throughput for advanced applications.”Various capacities offer enterprises flexible deploymentThe Micron 9400 SSD is available in a U.3 form factor that is backwards-compatible with U.2 sockets and comes in capacities ranging from 6.4TB to 30.72TB. These options provide data center operators the flexibility to deploy the most energy efficient storage while matching their workloads with the right blend of performance, capacity and endurance.7 This versatile SSD is built to manage critical workloads whether in on-premises server farms or in a multi-tenant shared cloud infrastructure, and can be flexibly deployed in hyperscale, cloud, data center, OEM and system integrator designs.Visit micron.com/9400 for more information.ResourcesProduct page: Micron 9400 NVMe SSD​Technical resourcesBlog: Micron 9400 NVMe SSD: The New Leader for Data Center WorkloadsProduct brief: Best-in-Class Capacity and Performance: The Micron 9400 NVMe SSDs Tame the Most Demanding Data Center WorkloadsAbout Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

Easterbrook was not by the book—but only the former business executive is facing repercussions for the affair.In 2019, McDonald’s abruptly fired Easterbrook, but key details leading to the decision were left out in the initial briefing to investors. The company ousted him for having a consensual relationship with a subordinate but did not say so in his separation agreement.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureSince Eastbrook’s firing was initially deemed to be “without cause” he remained entitled to a cushy equity compensation. More than half a year after Easterbrook was ousted, an internal probe found that he had engaged in not one but a string of undisclosed, improper relationships with other McDonald’s employees. Easterbrook’s failure to disclose these additional violations of company policy—McDonald’s prohibits dating or sexual relationships between employees with a direct or indirect reporting relationship to each other—influenced the accuracy of the fast-food giant’s disclosures to investors related to his departure and severance package.The SEC yesterday (Jan. 9) charged Easterbrook with “making false and misleading statements to investors” about the circumstances leading to his November 2019 firing. McDonald’s was also charged for holes in its public disclosures related to the termination.Without admitting or denying the SEC’s acquisition of fraud, Easterbrook agreed to enter the SEC’s cease-and-desist order. He has to pay a $400,000 civil penalty, and he has been banned from serving in officer or director positions at any firm for five years.McDonald’s ex-CEO broke trust and misled investors, the SEC says“When corporate officers corrupt internal processes to manage their personal reputations or line their own pockets, they breach their fundamental duties to shareholders, who are entitled to transparency and fair dealing from executives. By allegedly concealing the extent of his misconduct during the company’s internal investigation, Easterbrook broke that trust with–and ultimately misled–shareholders.” —Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.Story continuesThe money in Easterbrooks’s exit from McDonalds, by the digits$41.8 million: Easterbrook’s severance package including six months of pay, shares he can cash out later, and other equity.$23.8 million: Value of stock options he could exercise at the time of firing$12.37: Average hourly pay for a McDonald’s crew worker in the US$105 million: How much Easterbrook repaid, in cash and stock, in December 2021 to settle a lawsuit McDonald’s brought against him in August 2020, alleging he had inappropriate relationships with subordinates and covering it up.Why is McDonald’s not being fined?Often, in cases where executives violate its anti-fraud rules, the company is fined, too. To name a few:✈️ Last September, the SEC levied penalties of $200 million and $1 million on Boeing and then-CEO Muilenburg, respectively, for sharing misleading information about the Boeing 737 Max which was involved in some deadly crashes;🦠 In May 2022, the federal authority charged New York-based SCWorx upwards of $600,000 in penalties and disgorgement, and sought an officer and director bar against Schessel, for lying about the planned distribution of their covid-19 rapid testing kits;💰 Publicly-traded asset manager Medley Management and its former co-CEOs, Brook B. Taube and Seth B. Taube, were together told to pay a total of $10 million in April 2022 after the SEC accused them of “making misrepresentations to investors and clients that created the illusion of Medley’s likely future growth.”In McDonald’s case, though, the key difference is that the misrepresentation wasn’t about the business itself. And for some of the incidents, it could not disclose Easterbrook’s consensual relationships with subordinates because the company itself was not aware of them. Plus, it tried to remedy the situation.“We fired him, and then sued him upon learning that he lied about his behavior,” the company said in a statement.Taking all this into consideration, and then the “the substantial cooperation it provided…including voluntarily providing information not otherwise required to be produced in response to the staff’s requests,” the SEC rebuked McDonald’s, but chose not to impose a financial penalty on the fast food chain.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

""Businesses need to shift from a linear economy — extracting resources, using them quickly and discarding them as waste — to a circular economy where used products are repurposed and re-injected in the economy,"" said Ibrahim Thiaw in an interview with global consulting firm Protiviti while he was at COP27, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Protiviti logo. (PRNewsFoto/Protiviti) (PRNewsfoto/Protiviti)""Business has a huge role to play in shaping the consumption patterns of the growing middle class, as it will demand more land, water and other resources. There is a dire need for investments that, at once, match this huge consumer demand for change, and ensure we adapt to the multiple disruptions exacerbated by climate change and land degradation,"" stated Thiaw.The interview, conducted by Protiviti's Baris Karapinar, ESG and Sustainability lead for the firm's operation in Switzerland, wrapped up Protiviti's six-month exploration of the business impact of sustainability in a content series titled ""Future of ESG,"" the latest theme explored on the VISION by Protiviti online thought leadership platform.Thiaw calls on the private sector to help solve Earth's environmental challenges, including climate change, drought, water scarcity, land degradation and biodiversity loss. Doing so will give people a chance to generate 50 percent more wealth over the next three decades, Thiaw says. ""The world has a choice: Either we continue with the current nature-destructive path and lose up to half of the global GDP by 2050, or we take a sustainable land management approach to combat the current environmental crises we're facing.""Story continuesThe UN has led the global effort to raise awareness and affect action with its Sustainable Development Goals, a call for action by all countries — poor, rich and middle-income — to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. ""The global economy will lose an estimated US$23 trillion by 2050 through land and soil loss alone if we continue with business as usual,"" Thiaw said.The economic returns of restoring land and reducing degradation, greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss are estimated at US$140 trillion every year. That's about 1.5 times the global GDP of $93 trillion in 2021, according to the UN. ""This is an investment opportunity, not a threat to business,"" Thiaw said. Perhaps business could shift to a more 'nature-positive' business model, where the ultimate objective goes beyond the traditional bottom line of a company to embracing 'doing good,' as well, he added. ""The possibilities for business to drive change are unlimited. The choice is ours.""Cory Gunderson, executive vice president, Global Solutions, Protiviti, says the United Nations' message couldn't be clearer. ""Business leaders will play a critical role in helping solve some of the planet's biggest challenges. There are many paths to explore. We believe having clear strategic goals and objectives to address ESG matters is a key to future success. And it can be good business.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 Biggest New York Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, New York would be the 11th largest country in the world, bigger than Russia, Australia and Brazil. The third largest state in the U.S. by GDP, New York's current GDP was worth over $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Analysis. The vast majority of this GDP is derived from New York City, which is home to the most number of millionaires in the world at more the 345,000. New York City is considered to be the financial center of the world, home to Wall Street where most of the American financial services industry is based. This is why a lot of the biggest New York Companies and Stocks are financial services and insurance companies. This includes some of the biggest banks in not just the country but the world. Furthermore, the state is also home to some of the biggest drug companies in the world.25 biggest companies and stocksNew York Wall Street sign.Apart from finance, the state of New York is also home to one of the largest manufacturing sectors in the country, including publishing and printing in addition to the production of furs, railroad rolling stock and bus line vehicles. Other industries which maintain a significant including the ceramics and glass industry, nanotechnology and the microchip industry.Despite being an incredibly important part of the U.S. economy, New York actually has relatively high unemployment, even though it's decreased by 0.4% from August 2022 to November 2022. However, even after this decrease, unemployment in the state of New York is 4.3% with just 6 other states in the U.S. having a higher rate of unemployment. In March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reached its peak, New York City had an unemployment rate of 7.6% which was among the worst when considering the biggest cities in the country and it seems like the problem hasn't really properly gone away till now.Story continuesThus, there is great incentive for the state of New York to entice more businesses to consider moving their businesses from other states to here, with a success case being GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), a company engaged in the semiconductor industry which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to New York. To attract new businesses, New York does offer tax-free operations for ten years while being able to access state of the art facilities and get job credits in addition to manufacturing incentives for companies manufacturing in the state. There are a myriad of incentives, be it tax or otherwise, that companies can take advantage of if they are present or incorporating themselves in the state of New York.In 2022, while New York had a strong start, in the second half its growth rate trailed the national growth rate while the expectation according to TD Economics, is that the economy of the state will slow down to 0.8% in 2023 mainly because its financial industry is slowing down as a recession is imminent and interest rates are significantly higher. Even now, New York's labor market is 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level as the labor market has struggled to recover since. The national average has basically recovered fully which shows that the state is quite far behind the national average in this regard as well. Many people are starting to migrate from New York to other states as well, as remote working is a much bigger deal now because of the pandemic and people prefer to relocate to low cost of living areas, reducing the available talent pool for the biggest New York companies and stocks, especially those who want people to come to office.MethodologyThe biggest New York companies and stocks have a total market cap almost $3 trillion and over $1.3 trillion in revenue.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America.According to McKinsey, since April 2021, over 19 million US workers have left their jobs. This record-breaking rate has caused business disruption across the world. Around 53% of employers have reported observing significantly high labor turnover compared to previous years, and 64% anticipate the issue to worsen in the coming months. Companies are now actively working towards identifying challenges and establishing progressive workplace practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the evolution of the workplace culture due to lockdowns and restrictions of movement across the world. There has been increased focus on diversity and inclusion at workplaces across the US.A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that motivate employees to reach their full potential. As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diversity—through the lenses of color, gender, skill, and sexual orientation — can serve to build companies. According to McKinsey’s “Diversity Wins” report, the possibility of outperformance increases with the level of gender diversity. For instance, businesses that have more than 30% female executives do better than those that have between 10% and 30% female executives. Companies with the highest levels of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts.A sense of inclusiveness has a strong relationship with employee engagement. People who have a strong sense of inclusion are more likely than others to express enthusiasm for and dedication to their organizations. McKinsey’s research revealed that a perceived lack of inclusiveness at a company led over 40% of respondents to decline or decide against applying for a job. Progressive workplaces such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are replacing the conventional workplace model where employees work on a clock and managers enforce strict rules and regulations without any room for open communication.Story continuesPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have referred to renowned publications and websites such as Forbes, Fortune 100, and Top Workplaces to shortlist the 15 most progressive companies in America. We have used 8 articles to report the consensus picks of established publications. These companies have been ranked in ascending order in terms of the number of sources that have termed them progressive.15 Most Progressive Companies in America15. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a Mayfield, Ohio-based insurance company. It is the third biggest insurance carrier in the US, with a presence in over 50 states. Furthermore, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is also the largest US automobile insurance provider, with a headcount of 51,431 employees as of 2022.The company has the distinction of filling up 80% of jobs above entry-level positions by promoting its talent internally. This reflects the entity’s focus on promoting internal growth opportunities for its employees. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also conducts a Multicultural Leadership Development Program for its employees. Over 60% of the program graduates are promoted to higher positions. According to “Great Place to Work,” 96% of employees think that the corporation makes them feel welcome at their initiation.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Progressive Corp had a positive contribution to performance during the quarter. Net Premiums Written (NPW) grew +12% as the Company grew both policies in force and took rate to offset higher loss cost trends that are being driven by inflation. For example, we estimate accident severity for personal auto are up +35% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, this is partially offset by a 20% decline in frequency, due to people driving fewer miles. Progressive is making up for this net rise in cost by raising policy rates in the mid-teens percentage range. Progressive has been relatively early to take rate compared to industry peers, so the Company should be able to aggressively compete for share as competitors play catchup.”14. Fidelity InvestmentsNumber of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2Fidelity Investments is a Boston, Massachusetts-based privately held financial services firm that provides financial planning solutions and advice related to retirement planning, wealth management, investing, trading, and brokerage services.Fidelity Investments is ranked 27 among the best employers for diversity by Forbes. The company provides its customers with the option of sustainable investing, as two-thirds of investors think that social impact is integral in determining where to invest. Abigail Johnson has led Fidelity Investments as President and CEO of the company since 2014. According to Great Place to Work, 88% of employees at Fidelity Investment think the company provides a conducive environment for personal growth. The company also scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index last year.13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports online money transfers worldwide.Leading publication Forbes has ranked the company 20th on its list of employers known for promoting diversity in the US. Furthermore, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands 45th among the world’s best employers and holds the 123rd place among the world’s top female-friendly organizations. According to GlobalData, the company has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce. Meanwhile, 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics and Latinx, and African Americans. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also have programs related to parental preparedness and Global Wellness Days to ensure employees’ well-being.Wedgewood Partners shared its outlook on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based creative, marketing, and document management software corporation.In terms of gender representation, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) claims to have 33.6% female employees in its workforce of 25,000 employees. Women occupy 27.2% of the leadership positions in the company. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is targeting the proportion to increase to 30% by 2025 and eventually achieve gender parity. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has brought in Brian Miller as the Chief Talent, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer to ensure the company meets its strategic goals. Every year since 2001, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recognized 12 employees with Adobe’s Founder Award to honor the brightest in the company through a peer-to-peer system.Here’s what Renaissance Investment Management said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the quarter. The company reported decelerating revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but more concerning was the announced acquisition of privately held Figma for a record $20 billion. While management made a compelling case for the acquisition, the price paid revived fears that Adobe is facing increasing competitive threats.”11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) customer relationship management (CRM) company.Back in 2019, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) aimed to have half of its workforce represent minority groups. The company managed to achieve this target one year earlier, as 50.7% of its employees today belong to underrepresented groups. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) intends to connect executive compensation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals to increase accountability. Progressive initiatives at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are led by Lori Castillo Martinez as the Chief Equality Officer. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has been undertaking progressive measures for a number of years now. In 2015, the company conducted an equal pay audit that resulted in a salary adjustment of $3 million.Oakmark Funds shared its outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Rogers, Arkansas-based operator of the discount department, grocery stores, and hypermarkets. The company is the biggest retailer in the world, with a headcount of over 1.6 million employees in the US alone across its 4,000 stores.Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) increased the average hourly wage of its 36,000 pharmacy technicians to $20 per hour.Leaven Partners shared its stance on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”9. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based operator, franchisor, and licensor of lodging services comprising hotel, residential and timeshare properties.Marriott International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MAR) in its October investor letter:“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is the world’s largest hotel company followed closely by Hilton (HLT) and Intercontinental Hotels Group plc (IHG). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Aloft), through the mid-tier (Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels), to the luxury high end (JW Marriot, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis). In total the company had 7,642 properties with over 1.4 million rooms as of the end of Q1 2021.The majority (85%) of Marriott’s revenue comes from hotels in the United States, with the rest almost evenly split between Asia Pacific and Europe. Like it’s smaller peer, Hilton, the company today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels, not a hotel owner. The company owns 66 hotels, manages 2,083 and franchises 5,493. Like all franchise-based businesses Marriott requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Marriott currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However, the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure (the company acquired Starwood Properties in late 2016) – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid, as we expect it will, the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based payment card company.As of 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has invested $1 billion in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives.

(NYSE:HLT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a McLean, Virginia-based hospitality company with a wide variety of hotels and resorts in its portfolio.According to Great Place to Work, the company has been regarded as the best organization for diversity and parents. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) provides benefits like adoption assistance, parental leave, and GED support to its associates at its properties.

(NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential, led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel, with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows, and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight, Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model, and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant, results have vastly improved throughout the year as COVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus, and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months, Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

The consumer products company is benefiting from K-C Strategy 2022. Management has been taking robust steps to lower costs amid rising inflationary headwinds.Let’s delve deeper.What’s Working Well for Kimberly-Clark?Kimberly-Clark is committed to its three key strategic growth pillars — improving core business in developed markets, speeding up growth in the Personal Care segment in developing and emerging markets and enhancing digital and e-commerce capacities. The company expects to meet these objectives through product development across different categories and leveraging capabilities in marketing and sales.The company has been progressing well with expanding global business. In February 2022, Kimberly-Clark acquired a majority stake in Thinx, Inc. — the pioneer in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category. In October 2020, Kimberly-Clark completed the acquisition of Softex Indonesia — a leading player in the Indonesian personal care market. Recently, Kimberly-Clark entered into an agreement to sell its Neve tissue brand in Brazil and related consumer and KCP tissue assets to Suzano. Management expects to conclude the deal during the first half of 2023. The move will allow the company to focus on widening its higher-growth Personal Care business across Brazil while crafting a better future for the Consumer Tissue business across Brazil.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost Hurdles on the WayKimberly-Clark is battling high input costs for the past few quarters. In the third quarter of 2022, the company’s gross margin came in at 30.5%, almost flat compared with the adjusted gross margin reported in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was affected by major input cost inflation.Kimberly-Clark reported an adjusted operating profit of $745 million in the third quarter of 2022. The operating profit declined due to a rise in input costs to the tune of $360 million. Reduced volumes, escalated marketing, research and general expenses and unfavorable foreign currency also affected the operating profit. The company expects input cost inflation of $1.4-$1.6 billion for the full year.While input costs are expected to flare up, management is aggressively cutting costs and enhancing supply-chain productivity through the Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE Program. The program has been generating solid cost savings for a while, which is driving performance. During the third quarter of 2022, the company generated savings of $80 million from the FORCE program, bringing year-to-date program savings to $175 million. Management is maintaining its cost savings from the FORCE program in the range of $300-$350 million in 2022. Considering the inflationary supply chain environment, management expects savings to have been at the lower end of the range.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 25.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 8.9% growth.Story continues3 Solid Food PicksSome better-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup CPB and Mondelez International MDLZ.Conagra Brands, operating as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

SDC is well poised for growth in coming quarters, backed by continued strategic partnerships. The company’s continued expansion in the teledentistry space is encouraging. The company ended the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected revenues, instilling optimism. However, tough competition and operating loss raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 80.4% against a 6.3% fall of the industry and a 18% drop of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned oral care company has a market capitalization of $159,3 million. The company projects 17.9% growth for the next five years, ahead of the industry’s projected growth rate of 9.7%.Factors At PlayQ3 Upsides: SmileDirectClub exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. While the third-quarter revenue was impacted by the continued macro headwinds affecting SmileDirectClub customers, the company’s restructuring plan implemented in January is driving meaningful improvements in its cost structure and free cash flow. Despite a $31 million year-over-year decline in revenues from the third quarter of 2021, EBITDA improved by $24 million and free cash flow rose by $29 million in the reported quarter.Expansion in Teledentistry Space: Going by a June 2021 Insight Partners report, the Teledentistry market (which was valued at $667.13 million in 2019) is projected to reach $2.61 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 17.1% during 2019–2027. The company currently provides a doctor-directed digital end-to-end experience in teledentistry, with 24/7 access to orthodontic care and the back end of a lifetime smile guarantee.

General and administrative expenses were down 11.9% year over year. The company incurred an adjusted operating loss of $58.9 million in the quarter, narrower than the year-ago adjusted operating loss of $83.6 million.Tough Competitive Landscape: SmileDirectClub competes with a handful of smaller companies that collectively have limited market share in the clear aligner industry, including Candid Co., Byte (Dentsply), and SnapCorrect.

Yet, the current economic uncertainty, along with a challenging volume environment and severe FX headwinds, is a concern. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the third quarter of 2022, LabCorp Diagnostics performed well with Base Business revenue growth of 3.7% year over year and a 4% CAGR versus 2019. With Ascension being organic in the upcoming quarter, the company expects full-year revenue growth of 6% to 7%.Drug Development Base Business fundamentals remained strong in Q3. The company expects a full-year CAGR of almost 8% from 2019. Further, LabCorp is accelerating the planned spin-off of its Clinical Development business (announced in July). The company noted that it is managing inflationary headwinds and labor constraints through its LaunchPad initiatives.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings PriceLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings PriceLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings price | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteIn terms of portfolio enhancement, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. The company has also entered into a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases. The company has also seen growing demand for its at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand.In Oncology, LabCorp is benefiting from Personal Genome Diagnostics, an omni portfolio that includes advanced liquid biopsy, tissue-based diagnostics and kitting solutions. The company currently has the broadest portfolio and capabilities in oncology diagnostics.On the flip side, Over the past year, LabCorp has underperformed its industry. Shares of LabCorp have declined 16.6% compared with the industry’s 6.3% decline.Story continuesLabCorp’s revenues for the third quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and fell year over year. The decline in revenues can be attributed to a 10.7% fall in organic revenues and a 1.3% negative impact from foreign currency translation. The reduced sales growth across the company’s Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development operating segments on a reported basis raises apprehension.The ongoing decline in COVID-19 Testing sales is discouraging too. Further, the significant plunge in EPS is worrisome. The persistent inflationary pressure and the ongoing Ukraine/Russia crisis continue to impact business performance.As a result of escalating costs, gross margin contracted 472 basis points (bps) to 29.4% in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income marked a 36.5% plunge from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin declined 606 bps from the year-ago quarter to 15.2%. This decline in adjusted operating income and margin is primarily attributable to a reduction in COVID-19 testing, higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs during the quarter under review.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. GSK (GSK) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.71 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 8, 2023.GSK's Earnings ESP sits at 12.11%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.71 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63.GSK is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Boston Scientific (BSX) as well.Boston Scientific is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 1, 2023. BSX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.47 a share 23 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific is $0.47, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.39%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GSK and BSX could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Indeed, these biotech companies have the potential to revolutionize the medical world and offer solutions to unmet needs, while their relevance is recession-proof.With growing demand for gene therapies, immune oncology, and precision medicine, biotech companies have a unique opportunity to impact the world of healthcare. Undoubtedly, these stocks offer a valuable option for investors seeking in innovative solutions to benefit a global population. Accordingly, for whether it’s battling aging or developing treatments for serious health issues, biotech companies remain one of the most popular categories for growth investors.The future of the global biotech industry looks very bright. Research firm Grand View estimates this sector could surge to a value of $2.44 trillion over the next eight years. Notably, various factors are driving this growth. These include government policies highly conducive to growth in the sector, effective investments, and exciting new technological innovations such as synthetic biology. Furthermore, businesses have been able to capitalize on strong demand for their products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, here are three of the best biotech companies to watch right now.VRTXVertex Pharmaceuticals$290.21GMABGenmab$42.89UTHRUnited Therapeutics$276.17Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Various medical equipment is on top of a page with information about cystic fibrosis.Source: ShutterstockVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) has made incredible progress in its strategic focus on rational drug design. Offering some of the most revolutionary medicines, the Boston-based firm is making waves with its impressive healthcare solutions for chronic pain, muscular dystrophy, and sickle cell disease. Therefore, it’s not surprising to see Vertex listed among the top-performing biotech stock picks for 2023. Investors believe this company is only beginning to fulfill its promise.Story continuesWith a focus on scientific innovation and cutting-edge treatments for some of the world’s greatest medical challenges, Vertex Pharmaceuticals offers a much-needed ray of hope for millions around the globe. Additionally, investors will surely want to pay close attention to Vertex due to the company’s impressive financial performance in the most recent quarter. Not only did the company’s results exceed expectations, but Vertex also raised its projected sales growth figures for 2022.With over 30% growth in earnings and revenues over the past five years, we can conclude that Vertex has outperformed most of its peers, and is likely well-positioned relative to other industry players. Thus, I think this stock looks enticing for long-term investors to look to capitalize on the stock’s strong momentum.Genmab (GMAB)Phot of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effectSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageGenmab (NASDAQ:GMAB) has come a long way since it was established 24 years ago. Indeed, Genmab is now one of the leading biotechnology companies in the world.How has Genmab surged to its current position in the market?Well, the Copenhagen-based company has put its antibody technology front-and-center. Genmab already has six market products approved for treatment of multiple kinds of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The impact this has had on people’s lives is remarkable, providing investors with an altruistic angle when considering this stock. Accordingly, with Genmab’s breakthrough therapies offering hope to millions who would otherwise struggle with their medical conditions, it’s a stock that’s both inspiring as well as lucrative for those thinking long-term.Genmab has certainly made a powerful entrance onto the public markets with its two products, Darzalex and Arzerra. Darzalex treats difficult forms of blood cancer, while Arzerra tackles leukemia and multiple sclerosis. With Novartis (NYSE:NVS) as its marketing partner, Arzerra’s access to a global market is certain to give it great reach. Genmab’s pipeline is also impressive, as the company develops treatments for breast and ovarian cancers, while also studying teprotumumab with Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP).This innovative company will be one to watch in the coming months. Indeed, I think this stock has a bright future from here.United Therapeutics (UTHR)In this photo illustration United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR) logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comUnited Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) is an incredible company that many people have not yet had the chance to learn about. United Therapeutics’ work in lung disease and organ manufacturing technology is revolutionary. And this company’s mission is just as altruistic, with a focus on developing key treatments to extend patients’ lives. Not only does the company pursue ground-breaking treatments, but its commitment to helping the people who need it most makes them a great choice for nosy investors looking for more than just financial gains.Investors should be delighted with the company’s recent performance. Over the past year, UTHR delivered a blistering return of nearly 33%. That’s even more impressive when you consider that most of this upswing occurred in the last six months, with the stock market in doldrums. The main drivers for UTHR stock’s record-breaking surge have been based on its robust fundamental performance. Most recently, United posted third-quarter results that blew away analysts’ expectations. It appears UTHR stock has a promising future, regardless of market ebbs and flows, making it an attractive buy for investors eager for healthy returns.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Progressive Companies in America.According to McKinsey, since April 2021, over 19 million US workers have left their jobs. This record-breaking rate has caused business disruption across the world. Around 53% of employers have reported observing significantly high labor turnover compared to previous years, and 64% anticipate the issue to worsen in the coming months. Companies are now actively working towards identifying challenges and establishing progressive workplace practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the evolution of the workplace culture due to lockdowns and restrictions of movement across the world. There has been increased focus on diversity and inclusion at workplaces across the US.A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that motivate employees to reach their full potential. As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diversity—through the lenses of color, gender, skill, and sexual orientation — can serve to build companies. According to McKinsey’s “Diversity Wins” report, the possibility of outperformance increases with the level of gender diversity. For instance, businesses that have more than 30% female executives do better than those that have between 10% and 30% female executives. Companies with the highest levels of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts.A sense of inclusiveness has a strong relationship with employee engagement. People who have a strong sense of inclusion are more likely than others to express enthusiasm for and dedication to their organizations. McKinsey’s research revealed that a perceived lack of inclusiveness at a company led over 40% of respondents to decline or decide against applying for a job. Progressive workplaces such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) are replacing the conventional workplace model where employees work on a clock and managers enforce strict rules and regulations without any room for open communication.Story continuesPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have referred to renowned publications and websites such as Forbes, Fortune 100, and Top Workplaces to shortlist the 15 most progressive companies in America. We have used 8 articles to report the consensus picks of established publications. These companies have been ranked in ascending order in terms of the number of sources that have termed them progressive.15 Most Progressive Companies in America15. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is a Mayfield, Ohio-based insurance company. It is the third biggest insurance carrier in the US, with a presence in over 50 states. Furthermore, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is also the largest US automobile insurance provider, with a headcount of 51,431 employees as of 2022.The company has the distinction of filling up 80% of jobs above entry-level positions by promoting its talent internally. This reflects the entity’s focus on promoting internal growth opportunities for its employees. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) also conducts a Multicultural Leadership Development Program for its employees. Over 60% of the program graduates are promoted to higher positions. According to “Great Place to Work,” 96% of employees think that the corporation makes them feel welcome at their initiation.Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Progressive Corp had a positive contribution to performance during the quarter. Net Premiums Written (NPW) grew +12% as the Company grew both policies in force and took rate to offset higher loss cost trends that are being driven by inflation. For example, we estimate accident severity for personal auto are up +35% since the beginning of the pandemic. However, this is partially offset by a 20% decline in frequency, due to people driving fewer miles. Progressive is making up for this net rise in cost by raising policy rates in the mid-teens percentage range. Progressive has been relatively early to take rate compared to industry peers, so the Company should be able to aggressively compete for share as competitors play catchup.”14. Fidelity InvestmentsNumber of sources that termed the company as progressive: 2Fidelity Investments is a Boston, Massachusetts-based privately held financial services firm that provides financial planning solutions and advice related to retirement planning, wealth management, investing, trading, and brokerage services.Fidelity Investments is ranked 27 among the best employers for diversity by Forbes. The company provides its customers with the option of sustainable investing, as two-thirds of investors think that social impact is integral in determining where to invest. Abigail Johnson has led Fidelity Investments as President and CEO of the company since 2014. According to Great Place to Work, 88% of employees at Fidelity Investment think the company provides a conducive environment for personal growth. The company also scored 100 on the Disability Equality Index last year.13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose, California-based financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports online money transfers worldwide.Leading publication Forbes has ranked the company 20th on its list of employers known for promoting diversity in the US. Furthermore, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands 45th among the world’s best employers and holds the 123rd place among the world’s top female-friendly organizations. According to GlobalData, the company has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce. Meanwhile, 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics and Latinx, and African Americans. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also have programs related to parental preparedness and Global Wellness Days to ensure employees’ well-being.Wedgewood Partners shared its outlook on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues, the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account, thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program, which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose, California-based creative, marketing, and document management software corporation.In terms of gender representation, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) claims to have 33.6% female employees in its workforce of 25,000 employees. Women occupy 27.2% of the leadership positions in the company. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is targeting the proportion to increase to 30% by 2025 and eventually achieve gender parity. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has brought in Brian Miller as the Chief Talent, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer to ensure the company meets its strategic goals. Every year since 2001, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recognized 12 employees with Adobe’s Founder Award to honor the brightest in the company through a peer-to-peer system.Here’s what Renaissance Investment Management said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“On the negative side, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the largest detractor from portfolio performance in the quarter. The company reported decelerating revenue growth in its most recent quarter, but more concerning was the announced acquisition of privately held Figma for a record $20 billion. While management made a compelling case for the acquisition, the price paid revived fears that Adobe is facing increasing competitive threats.”11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 3Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a San Francisco, California-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) customer relationship management (CRM) company.Back in 2019, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) aimed to have half of its workforce represent minority groups. The company managed to achieve this target one year earlier, as 50.7% of its employees today belong to underrepresented groups. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) intends to connect executive compensation with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals to increase accountability. Progressive initiatives at Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are led by Lori Castillo Martinez as the Chief Equality Officer. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has been undertaking progressive measures for a number of years now. In 2015, the company conducted an equal pay audit that resulted in a salary adjustment of $3 million.Oakmark Funds shared its outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a Rogers, Arkansas-based operator of the discount department, grocery stores, and hypermarkets. The company is the biggest retailer in the world, with a headcount of over 1.6 million employees in the US alone across its 4,000 stores.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is actively making efforts to promote a progressive work culture. As of 2022, 53% of all the company’s associates in the US are women. Meanwhile, 21% of its associates are Blacks or African American. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has also launched a progressive wage structure for its pharmacy technicians to increase their hourly wage by $4 over the course of four years. In June 2022, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) increased the average hourly wage of its 36,000 pharmacy technicians to $20 per hour.Leaven Partners shared its stance on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”9. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based operator, franchisor, and licensor of lodging services comprising hotel, residential and timeshare properties.Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) launched a $50 million development program in June 2022 focused on addressing challenges related to the underrepresentation of minorities in developing and owning hotels in the North American region. The company intends to create an expected asset value of $1 billion through the development program. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has had a diversity and inclusion program for more than two decades. The company claims to have 54% of female employees in its workforce. Overall, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) intends to have 3,000 diverse-owned hotels in its portfolio by 2025.Here’s what LRT Capital Management said about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its October investor letter:“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is the world’s largest hotel company followed closely by Hilton (HLT) and Intercontinental Hotels Group plc (IHG). The company owns a portfolio of brands from the low end (Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, Aloft), through the mid-tier (Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Renaissance Hotels), to the luxury high end (JW Marriot, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis). In total the company had 7,642 properties with over 1.4 million rooms as of the end of Q1 2021.The majority (85%) of Marriott’s revenue comes from hotels in the United States, with the rest almost evenly split between Asia Pacific and Europe. Like it’s smaller peer, Hilton, the company today is almost exclusively a manager and franchisor of hotels, not a hotel owner. The company owns 66 hotels, manages 2,083 and franchises 5,493. Like all franchise-based businesses Marriott requires very little capital to grow as it utilizes the investment capital of its hotel-owners/partners to expand. Marriott currently faces a difficult operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty about the future of business travel. However, the company is an excellent operator with a somewhat leveraged capital structure (the company acquired Starwood Properties in late 2016) – if pent-up demand for travel materializes post-Covid, as we expect it will, the company will quickly go from losing money to raking in profits.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a New York-based payment card company.As of 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has invested $1 billion in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. The company intends to spend an additional $3 billion by 2025 to promote these initiatives. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the US for the last two consecutive years. Forbes has ranked American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the 61st position in the list of employees known for promoting diversity. In March 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) also launched its Amex Flex working system to allow employees to work either in an office or virtually. Under this initiative, 40% of employees have decided to go completely virtual.7. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT)Number of sources that termed the company as progressive: 4Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a McLean, Virginia-based hospitality company with a wide variety of hotels and resorts in its portfolio.According to Great Place to Work, the company has been regarded as the best organization for diversity and parents. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) provides benefits like adoption assistance, parental leave, and GED support to its associates at its properties. The company intends to achieve equal representation of both genders in leadership positions globally by 2027 and have 25% ethnic diversity in leadership roles across the US. Furthermore, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has partnered with the Atlanta, Georgia-based Morris Brown College to create a sustainable relationship with college students by establishing a $30 million hotel and hospitality training center.Here’s what Pershing Square Holdings said about Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential, led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel, with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began, Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period, but also positioned the company to generate improved margins, cash flows, and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight, Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality, asset light, high-margin business model, and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant, results have vastly improved throughout the year as COVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus, and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months, Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

351,a253d493-624f-3044-bf9b-56b92e671eed,UNH,2023-01-10,Returns At UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Appear To Be Weighed Down,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-unitedhealth-group-nyse-unh-110046755.html,1673348446,STORY,['UNH'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for UnitedHealth Group, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$27b ÷ (US$243b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 19%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 10% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for UnitedHealth Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering UnitedHealth Group here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 73% in that time. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOn a side note, UnitedHealth Group's current liabilities are still rather high at 42% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.What We Can Learn From UnitedHealth Group's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 126% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching UnitedHealth Group, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more of the best growth stocks, go directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In a report titled “2023 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions” JPMorgan mentioned some reasons why now could be the right time to pile into growth stocks, citing lower valuations. Here are some of the important comments of JPMorgan relevant to our article:""Lower valuations and higher yields mean that asset markets today offer the best long-term returns in more than a decade. It took a painful slump in stock and bond markets to get here, the worst of which may not yet be over. Still, the turmoil of 2022 might be considered a cathartic moment, revitalizing the portfolio toolkit and creating attractive investment opportunities in the years ahead.""Growth stocks could be the solid investment options for beginner investors as JPMorgan believes that the current market pressures would eventually recede. That means growth stocks could rebound strongly.“We expect today’s inflationary surge to eventually subside to a rate only slightly above our previous estimates. Our forecast annual return for a USD 60/40 stock-bond portfolio over the next 10–15 years leaps from 4.30% last year to 7.20%. Over the last 25 years, the rolling 10-year return for this portfolio has averaged 6.10%.""The report also said:“Opportunities for long-term investors with capital to deploy are the best we’ve seen since 2010. Meanwhile, we would remind those shouldering losses from the last year that investors able to avoid selling during drops tend to be rewarded in the longer run, and that the sharpest gains are often banked early in the cycle as markets first turn.”Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, used the growth ETF SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) and ranked the stock holdings of the ETF based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies as of the end of the third quarter.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two significant actions taken in the quarter were the exit of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and the initiation of Boeing. Adobe paid a price to acquire a competitor called Figma ($22B) that we could not justify even under the most bullish fundamental outlook. It struck us as desperate, defensive, and reactive. After reassuring investors for many quarters that Figma was not having a negative competitive impact on its business, to us this was a clear admission of the opposite. While a more optimistic interpretation could be that Figma is a good asset, Adobe just got rid of a competitor, and the day 1 stock reaction already wiped out more than $22B from Adobe’s market cap – we saw too many red flags potentially signaling worsening trends to come in Adobe’s core. It is also not obvious to us why Figma sails through anti-trust clearance, which if the deal is not allowed to proceed would leave a gaping exposure as Adobe just showed its hand.”10.

Thanks to the ease and convenience of online shopping, cosmetics sales via online channels are increasing consistently.Cosmetic companies are making significant progress on this front, evident from tools like virtual try, new digital payment solutions and digital marketing efforts. Other than this, players have been fueling brand portfolios through prudent buyouts and strategic alliances.Inflationary Headwinds: Companies in the cosmetics space are encountering inflationary pressure on operating costs like labor, supplies and travel. Several players are battling supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity, resulting in increased freight costs.In addition, elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to have pushed SG&amp;A costs upward for cosmetic companies. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins. The impact of lower demand due to inflationary pressure and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Cosmetics industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

Every day, millions of Americans compensate for what their dishwasher may leave behind by prewashing, rewashing and hand drying for clean, cabinet-ready dishes. To combat this waste in precious resources of additional time, effort and water, Cascade developed Cascade Platinum Plus, a first-of-its-kind cleaning system that allows people to skip all the extra steps. Simply scrape off any remaining food, load it into the dishwasher, and you’re done. No prewash, no rewash - or your money back.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230110005008/en/(Photo: Business Wire)To develop its biggest formula upgrade in a decade, Cascade tested 10 prototype formulations and 13,000 test pods to perfect the super-packed Cascade Platinum Plus ActionPac. The incomparable dual-power cleaning formula is comprised of cleaning ingredients to hydrate and scrub dried-on food, plus starch- and protein-fighting enzymes to break down tough-to-clean foods better than ever before. The new formula2 features:50% more protein-fighting enzymes to break down protein-rich foods2x the amount of a new, proprietary enzyme to better fight stubborn starches2x the grease cleaning power of Dawn to remove grease, deliver improved shine, and help dry dishesTo better understand America’s broken dishwashing routine and the intrinsic value of a dishwasher doing its job, Cascade commissioned a survey3 of dishwasher users to learn more about their habits and frustrations. The results prove just how inefficient and dissatisfying current dishwashing routines are:Story continuesAt least once a week, people do extra work when running the dishwasher, including rewashing (57%) their dishes, manually drying (68%), or prerinsing/prewashing (86%)Nearly half (49%) of people feel stressed or overwhelmed when dishes are not clean enough to immediately put away when the dishwasher is doneHaving to correct a dishwasher failure causes 48% of people to miss out on personal time""For years we have heard people debate the need to prerinse dishes and express their frustration with having to rewash items that do not come out of the dishwasher perfectly clean the first time. When people do the job of their dishwasher, it is clear their dish washing routine is broken,"" said Guerin McClure, Vice President, North America Dish Care, Procter &amp; Gamble. ""We formulated Cascade Platinum Plus to allow for dishes to go straight from the table, to the dishwasher, to the cabinet, so people can spend less time at the sink and more time doing things that they enjoy.""Cascade recognizes old prerinsing habits die hard and people do not believe they can simply scrape, load, and be done, particularly with tough-to-clean items like a crusty casserole dish or teriyaki-glazed skillet. The brand dares America to skip the prerinse by taking the ""Cascade Platinum Plus Load This, Get This"" challenge to experience the time- and resource-saving benefits when the dishwasher can be the dish washer. To kickstart the cleaning revolution, Cascade is giving away 10 million Cascade Platinum Plus ActionPacs and offering a money-back guarantee on its best clean yet.New Cascade Platinum Plus is launching with support of a national integrated marketing campaign that encourages viewers to ""Dare to Dish Differently"" and is now available in stores nationwide and online.

358,c42bbd92-0921-3471-89b3-c8ecac962fbf,PG,2023-01-10,15 Companies That Still Test on Animals in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-companies-still-test-animals-014537588.html,1673315137,STORY,['PG'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 companies that still test on animals in 2022. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 companies that still test on animals in 2022.There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the use of animals in testing, particularly for products such as cosmetics and household cleaning products. Some people argue that testing on animals is necessary in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these products, while others argue that it is unethical to subject animals to such testing, and that alternative methods should be used instead.Many companies test on animals to ensure that their products are safe for human use. Before products are sold to the general public, companies need to ensure that their cosmetics are both properly labelled and safe. In the U.S., this is regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. While the act doesn't tell companies to use animals for testing their products, it is often the only natural conclusion to fulfil the requirements of the Act. Hence, animal testing is used by these companies to ensure that their products can be used or consumed by humans.This is an issue for companies in various industries, including cosmetics, pharmaceutical and medical research laboratories. Various products be it makeup items, medicine and shampoos to surgical procedures are first tested on animals. While this may seem necessary, it is important to note that this often falls under animal cruelty, due to the effects of this testing on animals. According to the Humane Society International, more than 115 million animals are used in testing every single year worldwide. Even if these tests are classified as ""mild"", there is a strong chance that animals are likely to face not just physical but mental distress and suffering, while some of the harsher treatments can cause irreparable damage. Many animals are often even killed at the end of experiments.Story continues15 companies that still test on animals in 2022Kingcraft/Shutterstock.comWhile many people may argue that animal testing is necessary and people are being overly sensitive, you might change your mind if you knew about some of the experiments that are conducted, such as forced chemical exposure to determine toxicity testing including forced-feeding, exposure to drugs or chemicals which can result in severe physical harm and even death, manipulation of genes, infliction of wounds, infliction of pain and even behavioral experiments. In plain words, this is pure torture of animals which is illegal in every way, except when companies are able to lobby and get exemptions.Nowadays, investors don't just want to learn about the financial performance of a company, but also their contribution to society, which is where the term ESG comes in. ESG refers to environmental, society and governance and focuses on the non-financial contributions of a company. Many organizations are now lobbying for avoiding investing in companies which test products on animals, because that is the only way that companies will consider minimizing or completely eliminating animal testing. Such organizations include PETA, which states that ""cruelty-free investing means investing in companies, mutual funds, bonds, and other investment vehicles that do not support, cause, or contribute to animal exploitation and suffering, including the destruction of natural habitats.""PETA even maintains an exhaustive database which shows companies which test on animals, making it easier for potential investors to avoid such companies. Some examples of companies which have focused on non-animal testing include Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). One of the largest FMCG companies in the world, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has been implementing non-animal testing for decades now. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) also consistently publishes its work in this regard and collaborates with others to ensure that everyone is able to implement similar practices. The company has also been involved in working on regulatory changes that will lead to a decline in animal testing, and some of its brands have been certified by PETA as well. The company has also been involved in calling for a global ban on animal testing by 2023, as some of its products still have to be tested on animals to comply with local regulations, while it has maintained its stance that such testing is not necessary.Some states in the U.S. have also started to implement tougher regulations in this respect, and in 2022, the state of New York banned cosmetics animal testing which is the 10th such state in the country to do this. Worldwide, there are now 42 national bans in addition to 12 states banning the practice in Brazil.All of this is possible due to improvements in technology, which have made non-animal testing a real possibility. These technologies include a combination of 3D printing, robotics, computer models, microengineering and human cell, organs and tissues. There are several companies which are leading the way here, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), one of the largest healthcare companies by market cap, which purchased Advanced Bioprocessing for $477 million in 2018. With bans on animal testing increasing, and governments providing support to companies which are working on non-animal testing, this industry could see stratospheric growth and investing in it now might be a very viable possibility.Of course, many other companies have continued to test on animals despite the backlash. Recently, Neuralink, owned by everyone's favorite villain in Elon Musk, has been in the news for an investigation regarding its animal testing practices after allegations that more than 1,000 animals were killed by the company during rushed brain chip experiments. This should come as no surprise for a company owned by a person who considers laws and regulations as suggestions and believes money to be above everything else. There are many other such companies as well, which we'll mention below. Our list has been devised from PETA's directory which maintains extensive records regarding animal testing. So let's take a look at the companies that may end up on the wrong side of history if they don't change their ways, starting with number 15:15. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the biggest FMCG companies, with several of its brands earning more than $1 billion in revenue each every single year. While The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been working with PETA and the Humane Society International, some of its products are still tested on animals because of local regulations. Some of the brands owned by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which engage in animal testing according to PETA include Always, Bounty, Christina Aguilera Perfumes and Gillette, among others.14. BIC GroupBIC is one of the largest producers of lighters, stationery and shavers. While the company states that it is working with experts to evaluate alternative solutions to animal testing, it still engages in animal testing if alternates can't guarantee product safety for commercial use, and if aniaml testing is required by law.13. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)While PETA lists Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) as “working toward regulatory changes to reduce the number of animals used for testing”, this does not mean that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is cruelty-free. In fact, according to Logical Harmony, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) still tests on animals where required by law.12. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)3M Company (NYSE:MMM) producers over 36,000 different items and engages in animal testing where necessary. Despite pressure by several organizations, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the companies that still tests on animals in 2022.11. Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN)Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN) is a major retail corporation with operations in dozens of countries. Several brands owned by Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), including Free People and Anthropologie, sell animal-derived materials, which according to PETA, are always a product of extreme violence.10. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, which states that it doesn't engage in animal testing. However, in 2012, PETA filed a resolution asking Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to ""use non-animal methods for medical device training and to incorporate them consistently throughout the company’s operations."" This was opposed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stating that existing policies already covered what PETA proposed.9. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) states that it is fully committed to not testing on animals, but does so where required by law. Some of Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc.'s (NYSE:CHD) brands where animal testing takes place include Aim, Arm &amp; Hammer and Arrid among others.8. S.C. Johnson &amp; SonS.C. Johnson &amp; Son is the reason why the Johnson family is one of the wealthiest families in the world. The company manufactures cleaning supplies and some of its brands including Fantastik and Glade are engaged in animal testing, which is why it is unfortunately among the companies which still test on animals in 2022.8. Reckitt BenckiserAccording to PETA, some of Reckitt's brands which engage in animal testing include Lysol, Old English and Veet.7. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)While The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) claims that it stopped testing its products on animals, PETA mentions that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is the owner of several subsidiaries some of which still test on animals.6.

360,b8135af6-96cf-4721-9778-74dbeb33f937,PG,2023-01-10,Space offers ‘a fundamentally different' R&D environment: ISS Lab chief scientist,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/space-offers-a-fundamentally-different-rd-environment-iss-lab-chief-scientist-221135479.html,1673302295,STORY,"['PG', 'TSLA']","[The International Space Station (ISS) is open for business, ISS National Laboratory Chief Scientist Dr. Michael Roberts told Yahoo Finance at CES 2023 (video above).Roberts was at the event to spread the word about R&amp;D opportunities at the ISS.""We've all seen videos of crew members playing with water or M&amp;Ms in the space environment, so you understand that it's fundamentally a very different environment than we have here on Earth,"" he said. ""That translates into fundamental studies about the physics of objects. So, we've worked with materials science companies that are trying to improve turbine blades for use in spacecraft and aircraft engines. We work with engineers who work in propulsion systems that are trying to refine and increase fuel efficiency.""The world of companies that the ISS has partnered with is vast and includes both pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies.""We also work heavily with the pharmaceutical sector,"" he said. ""So, living in space for a long period of time is a lot, but it also wears on your body. Our immune systems don't function as well in that space environment. Our bones and muscles start to weaken over time, so you can exploit that as a medical researcher and understand ways to combat that here on Earth.""Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is an R&amp;D partner for the ISS, focusing on its efforts on laundry detergent mega-brand Tide. P&amp;G was initially approached by NASA, but it was the company's partnership with ISS that's allowed it to test out Tide in space, said Mark Sivik, P&amp;G Senior Director Research Fellow.""It costs roughly $10,000 to shoot a kilogram of water to the International Space Station, let alone going to the moon or Mars, so you don't just have an endless supply of water,"" said Sivik. ""A lot of people don't know this, but astronauts don't wash their clothes. So, any of the crew members that go up, they wear their clothing three to four days at a time, and they're replaced on resupply missions. Now, just imagine working out and wearing the same clothes the next day.""Story continuesIn microgravity conditions – conditions in which gravity isn't non-existent, but rather incredibly low – P&amp;G can test Tide in ways that it hasn't before, testing products for stability, longevity, and how well they perform over time. It's a vital product-testing opportunity, Sivik added.A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the Dragon capsule launches from Pad-39A on the Crew 5 mission carrying crew members commander Nicole Mann, pilot Josh Cassada, Roscosmos cosmonaut Anna Kikina and Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to the International Space Station from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S. October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Joe Skipper'It's driven down the cost of getting access to space'Roberts offered glowing words about the ISS's collaborators, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, which he says has helped usher in an era in which getting to space is less expensive.""For the first time in history, we have frequent access to space through the activities of SpaceX and Cygnus, operated by Northrop Grumman, and new player Sierra Space coming online soon,"" he said. ""There are lots of ways to get cargo, crew, and persons up to the International Space Station and beyond, so we're looking to build that even further in the future.""For example, SpaceX's reusable rockets have completely revamped daily life and operations at the Kennedy Space Center, according to Roberts.""We are the downstream benefactors of the great strides that SpaceX and other companies have made,"" he added. ""The ability to reuse space vehicles has completely changed where I live, near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. So, we now have launches that go up every week or every other week, and the great thing is that part of the launch comes back down every time they launch something up. That has done a tremendous amount of good for everybody in that it's driven down the cost of getting access to space.""Roberts' case is this – even though the ISS will go out of operation in the 2030s, there's unique R&amp;D that companies can do on the ISS today that could impact future missions.""The International Space Station's going to be operating until 2030 or so, but that's not going to be the end of it,"" said Roberts.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.5% each.Friday marked the second winning day of the week after a rocky start to the new year but managed to salvage the entire week on the back of economic indicators, especially from the labor market, adding fuel to the belief that the Fed’s policies have started to take effect. Data from the manufacturing sector also reiterated the same, contracting in December.With wage increases slowing despite higher nonfarm payrolls, the consensus was that the central bank would slow down its interest rate hikes going forward. The markets took off on what they believed to be the end of one of the Fed’s most aggressive tightening cycles in decades.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:The GEO Group, McGrath RentCorp Soar Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of The GEO Group, Inc. GEO have surged 31.2% since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on October 28.Another stock, McGrath RentCorp MGRC, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on the same dayand has returned 16.3% since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Story continuesCheck The GEO Group’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check McGrath RentCorp’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives Assertio and Halliburton Higher  Shares of Assertio Holdings, Inc. ASRT and Halliburton Company HAL have surged 97.3% and 10.9% since their Zacks Recommendation was upgraded to Outperform on October 24 and October 28, respectively.While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform.

Horton Inc (NYSE: DHI) by 32% in 4Q22 and taking its book value multiple up to a mid-cycle 1.7x valuation.Given the unpredictability of interest rates near-term, the analyst still thinks it's important for investors to keep at least one ""line in the water"" with respect to homebuilders.The analyst has downgraded D.R. Horton from Outperform to Market Perform with a price target of $61.00.The analyst said the best most attractive risk/reward opportunity lies in moving up the price point curve towards Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE: TOL), which is still trading at just 1.0x tangible book value and 7.9x CY23 EPS despite its very encouraging 2023 guidance.Horne upgraded Toll Brothers from Market Perform to Outperform with a price target of $61.While most of its peers are only able to offer limited earnings visibility into 2023, TOL's high-end $8.9 billion backlog of ~8,100 homes provide ample clarity into its ability to deliver solid 2023 earnings.The analyst expects less volatility around TOL's earnings estimates, with its more affluent buyers less sensitive to mortgage rate volatility, and with more readily available cash-on-hand.The analyst said that homebuilder balance sheets are better prepared for a downturn than at any other point in the sector's history.Due to affordability pressure and economic uncertainty, young adults are increasingly staying with their parents or bundling up with roommates to wait out the economic downturn.The analyst added that interest rate volatility and the resulting economic uncertainty are causing a broad-spectrum reduction in housing demand and household formation.Also Read: US Housing Starts: Single Family Permits Fall, But Completions Rise, Adding SupplyPrice Action: TOL shares are up 1.32% at $53.81 on the last check Monday.Story continuesLatest Ratings for TOLDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022JP MorganUpgradesUnderweightNeutralFeb 2022B of A SecuritiesUpgradesUnderperformBuyFeb 2022BarclaysMaintainsUnderweightView More Analyst Ratings for TOLView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

368,569a3c26-5fa9-302b-8a52-42585af6b2ae,AAL,2023-01-10,American Airlines (AAL) Is Attractively Priced Despite Fast-paced Momentum,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-attractively-priced-135001475.html,1673272201,STORY,['AAL'],"[Momentum investing is essentially an exception to the idea of ""buying low and selling high."" Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and American Airlines (AAL) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 4.8% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this world's largest airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. AAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 8.2% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for AAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.47. This indicates that the stock moves 47% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that AAL has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped AAL earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, AAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. AAL is currently trading at 0.20 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 20 cents for each dollar of sales.So, AAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to AAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Flights to these three cities are operated by AAL’s regional partners. The pilot shortage has hit the regional partners harder than the rest.Management has cited a pilot shortage and soft demand on those routes as reasons behind the decision. Following their withdrawal from the abovementioned three U.S. cities, the total number of markets exited by this Fort Worth, TX-based carrier since the commencement of the pandemic is eighteen.Per an AAL spokeswoman, ""Due to soft demand and the regional pilot shortage affecting the airline industry, American Airlines has made the difficult decision to end service in Columbus, Georgia, with the last day of operations scheduled for April 3, 2023"". We’ll proactively reach out to customers scheduled to travel to offer alternate arrangements.""A pilot shortage has gripped the U.S. airline industry big time. During the peak of the pandemic, when air-travel demand dropped dramatically, airlines urged their employees to take up early retirement packages. As a result, with the stronger-than-expected rebound in air travel demand, they are shortstaffed.Due to this staffing crunch, many cities in the United States have lost service from airline heavyweights like AAL and Delta Air Lines DAL. Following the exit of AAL, Delta will reportedly be the only carrier to operate flights at the Columbus airport.Delta will kickstart the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season for airline companies on Jan 13. Upbeat air travel demand is expected to have aided DAL’s fourth-quarter performance.

Still, the growth cools down in FY23, with estimates indicating a 15% Y/Y pullback in earnings.Sherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams manufactures and sells paints, coatings, and other related products.

If you can make it in a market like 2022, imagine what can happen in 2023 for many top pharma stocks.What the best pharma stocks have in common is pricing power, patented medicines, big moats and wide margins. They’re also members of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group that has fought for decades to keep prices high.Pricing is the key risk for these companies. The Inflation Reduction Act lets Medicare negotiate on prices for the first time. The Biden Administration is already touting a $35/month cap on insulin prices under the law.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut that could just be the start. If drugs cost less under Medicare than with private insurance, patients and plans may demand to be let in on the savings. The government will push drugmakers to compete on price, squeezing margins. Insurers may join them.That said, this trade group has dramatically weakened the final bill. It still has enormous power, before courts, legislators and regulators, even manipulating public opinion directly.The bottom line is that the law will be less-effective than advertised, at least in 2023, with many provisions failing to take effect for years. Thus, the industry has time to adapt, giving investors time to load up on thee top pharma stocks.MRKMerck$113.82LLYEli Lilly$360.18AMGNAmgen$267.83BMYBristol-Myers Squibb$72.33REGNRegeneron Pharmaceuticals$728.36Merck (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) had a spectacular 2022, with its stock rising 44% as the average stock in the S&amp;P 500 fell almost 20%. This brought the market cap of one of the top pharma stocks in the market to $280 billion in early 2023.Merck is best known for Keytruda, its anti-cancer immunosuppressant. But there’s a lot more to like, according to analysts. It has a COVID-19 pill called Lagevrio. It is also working with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) on a cancer vaccine. To keep growth going, it is buying Imago Biosciences (NASDAQ:IMGO), which is working on blood diseases. Thus, this is one of the top pharma stocks making waves in many areas of the market.Story continuesIn 2022 Merck saw record sales, higher profits, and promising results in clinical trials. Sotatercept, its hypertension drug acquired with Acceleron in 2021 for $11.5 billion, met the main goal on its latest clinical trial. The company’s early bet on using peptides to help otherwise-toxic drugs reach their targets is paying off.Merck remains a conservative investment. Its 73 cent per share dividend still yields 2.6%. Its price-earnings ratio of 18-times is not out of line, given 20% top-line growth and 17% profit growth. It even managed a successful CEO transition to Robert Davis.Technicians like Merck’s chart pattern and none of the 16 analysts following Merck at Tipranks want you to sell it, even at $110/share. In fact, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) recently raised its price target to $125/share.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock had a stellar 2022, rising nearly 33%. Its market cap entering January was about $347 billion. The company has a large lead in treating diabetes that is leading to breakthroughs in weight loss.Lilly may look overvalued with a price-earnings multiple of 55-times, and a 2022 growth rate of under 10%. That said, its best seller right now is Trulicity, a diabetes treatment that brought in nearly $6.5 billion last year. Past hits include Prozac for depression, Zyprexa for psychosis, and Humulin, a bio-engineered form of insulin. It is also delivering a long-acting insulin called Rezvoglar, which would be interchangeable with Sanofi’s (NYSE:SNY) Lantus. This could drive down the cost of diabetes care.But Lilly’s future looks even better than its past. Mounjaro, originally created for diabetes as tirzepatide, may find new sales as an obesity treatment. This would make it what our Louis Navillier calls a “mega blockbuster.” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) thinks Mounjaro could ring up sales of $50 billion. That’s more than Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) COVID vaccine, Comirnaty.Lilly is already expanding its manufacturing capacity in expectation of a quick approval. Lilly has another drug called retatrutide, about to go into Phase 3 testing, that could be even more effective. The drug works by mimicking a hormone that drives hunger, and by causing food to clear from the stomach more slowly.Small wonder that 11 of 13 analysts at Tipranks want you to buy LLY stock, with a price target of $400, 10% above its current level.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock managed to gain 17% in 2022, while the average S&amp;P stock lost 20%. This is among the most valuable pharma stocks out there, with a market cap of approximately $139 billion, a price-earnings ratio 21-times, and a fat dividend yield of 3.2%Amgen’s best seller, Enbrel, is an anti-cancer drug that had $6 billion of sales in a single year. It also sells Prolia, a shot for strengthening bones, an auto-immune drug called Otezla for psoriasis and arthritis, and an osteoporosis treatment called Xgeva. All are doing better than expected, and I expect Amgen to remain among the top pharma stocks for some time to come.But the real excitement surrounds the pending purchase of Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP) for nearly $28 billion. Horizon makes drugs for rare autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Its best known drug is Tepezza, used to treat thyroid eye disease.Each of Horizon’s drugs may have relatively modest sales. Tepezza had less than $500 million last year. But rare disease drugs have an easier time winning approval, and pricing is seldom an issue. To some analysts, this makes investing in Amgen a “no-brainer.” They point to the $11.7 billion it had in cash at the end of September, and operating cash flow of over $9 billion, which makes its acquisitions affordable.This view is not universal, however. Bears point to $37 billion in long-term debt even before the Horizon purchase, which came after Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) both expressed interest. Four of the company’s 16 analysts at Tipranks are telling clients to sell it.Amgen could also get a boost if it wins its effort to revive patents on its biologic Repatha, and block the sale of competing drugs from Sanofi and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The issue is how narrowly patents must be written and how different competing drugs must be to avoid violating them.Bristol-Myers (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock had a solid 2022, up over 16%. The company also hiked its dividend in December to 57 cents, meaning it now yields over 3.1%.The company’s best-selling drugs are Revlimid for multiple myeloma, Eliquis, a blood thinner, and Opdivo, which competes with Merck’s Keytruda as an anti-cancer immunosuppressant. All three, however, go off-patent later this decade.The company bought Celgene (makers of Revlimid) for $74 billion in 2019, which kept the stock’s performance down until 2022. The year was helped by $15 billion in stock buybacks to support the stock price. By September, the company still had $9.1 billion in cash and equivalents on its books.BMY got good news from regulators in 2022, who approved three new Bristol-Myers drugs, the most from any maker. These include a melanoma drug called Opdualag, which will help extend the patent life of Opdivo, Camzyos for a genetic heart disease that thickens the muscle and slows blood flow, and Sotyktu, an oral drug for severe psoriasis to compete with Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) Humira. Each are expected to become a $4 billion franchise over time.Some analysts are worried about expiring patents and slowing approvals, turning negative on Bristol-Myers. Most of the 11 following it are in the hold camp, with three saying buy and one saying sell.Regeneron (REGN)The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of top pharma stock to buy is Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). The company had a decent 2022, with REGN stock rising about 15%. This brought the company’s market cap to $78.5 billion, despite it having no dividend. Regeneron’s price-earnings ratio is 15-times.I have long been a fan of Regeneron thanks to their VelociSuite, which models what potential drugs might do on mice. I think having a system for drug discovery delivers more long-term value than just having a hit drug.While Regeneron is losing patent protection on Eylea, which fights macular degeneration, it has new blockbusters in Dupixent, an autoimmune drug, and Libtayo, which competes with Merck’s Keytruda.Regeneron was thought to be a COVID play in 2021 with its REGN-COV, but a cut in government funding recently caused it to cut four clinical trials of the drug. It also recently dropped work on medicines for chronic pain and cat allergies. One area where Regeneron is not cutting back is on obesity, where it’s working with a gene called GPR75 that can protect people from getting fat. It is trying three different methods for developing a drug in this area.Research cutbacks led to a bad third quarter, with sales and profits both down from a year earlier. This led analysts to downgrade their outlook on Regeneron stock. At Tipranks, only 7 of 13 want you to buy it, and 1 is telling clients to sell.While Regneron may look down now, I still think it’s the best of the five pharma stock studied here for the long term.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in MRNA and BAC.
