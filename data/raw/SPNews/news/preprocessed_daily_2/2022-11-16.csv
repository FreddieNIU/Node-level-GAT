It has amassed assets over $9.62 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap BlendCompared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.60%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 17.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Devon Energy Corp (DVN) accounts for about 1.03% of total assets, followed by Vici Pptys Inc (VICI) and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc Series (WBD).The top 10 holdings account for about 6.86% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHM seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index. The Index includes the mid-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace and includes the components ranked 501-1000 by full market capitalization.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -13.52% so far this year and is down about -15.80% in the last one year (as of 11/16/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $60.50 and $82.64.The ETF has a beta of 1.12 and standard deviation of 28.46% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 499 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. MidCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHM is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $51.36 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF has $65.70 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With most seeing a recession as inevitable, it remains a primary concern for 13% of traders.Most traders predict that the Fed will increase interest rates by at least .50 percentage points in December and don’t see rates dropping in the new year but are hopeful inflation will begin easing in 2023.

Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the largest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 24 million shares worth $372.5 million. Like T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), Vodafone Group Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:VOD) is one of the elite 5G stocks to monitor. 11.

(NASDAQ:QRVO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) is a North Carolina-based company that develops and commercializes technologies and products for wireless, wired, and power markets worldwide. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. In addition to posting market-beating Q3 results, Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) announced a new stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion on November 2.Benchmark analyst Cody Acree on November 3 maintained a Buy recommendation on Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $120 from $152. Qorvo, Inc.

(NASDAQ:QRVO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Qorvo Inc. is one of the two major providers of radio frequency RF systems which are critical components of mobile devices including smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT). Two transitory concerns have recently affected the company’s stock price. First, supply chain issues continue to be a constraint. Second, Apple recently announced its decision to decrease production of its iPhone SE model. Neither of these issues threatens their long-term competitive position. Qorvo’s value is stable and despite the recent pressure on the stock price, we feel its long-term prospects are promising.”9. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) is a Colorado-based company that provides pay-TV services in the United States.

Dish Network continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS’s cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish’s long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration’s infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.”8. Arista Networks, Inc.

The company’s top line growth has recently been bolstered by 400G deployments—the next generation of tech powering data centers—and further enterprise network penetration as customers migrate away from Cisco (~80% market share vs. ~5% for Arista). While the profit cycle is nicely in motion, we pared our exposure as shares began to approach our PMV estimate.”7. Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spend to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.”6.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpNotably, that recent sale by Timothy Welsh is the biggest insider sale of U.S. Bancorp shares that we've seen in the last year. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$43.77. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in U.S. Bancorp didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. Specifically, insiders ditched US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$110m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About U.S. Bancorp Insiders?Insiders sold U.S. Bancorp shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

After nine years, though, she was ready to return to civilian life - albeit unsure how she'd transition her training and talents into a private-sector role.Hiring Our Heroes quickly provided Rhoades with a solution. The nonprofit connects the military community - service members, military spouses and veterans - with American businesses for job training and other career opportunities. Rhoades landed an internship with U.S. Bank to prepare to be a mainframe software engineer, allowing her to adapt her military skills to her new role through hands-on training. She also meets twice weekly with an assigned mentor, and weekly with a manager to discuss her growth and development plan.""My experience has been amazing,"" she said. ""The instructors ensure we work with real-world applications and create programs we may encounter once we join our teams.""One of the instructors on her mainframe software engineer program, who is also a veteran, even went a step further and helped connect Rhoades and her husband to several community programs in Milwaukee so they could feel more integrated into their new hometown. ""He made my transition to civilian life much smoother,"" she said.Military Times this week named U.S. Bank one of its ""Best for Vets"" employers, an honor the company has received each year since 2010. One of the reasons cited by the publication is the strength of the company's Proud to Serve employee-led group, which has more than 5,000 members across the company and helps to shape how U.S. Bank supports military and veteran employees, customers and community members. The group also provides input into the bank's specialized products and services for veteran and military customers as well as community initiatives to donate off-lease vehicles and mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans.Story continues""We are passionate about hiring, developing and promoting veterans,"" said Scott Lippert, U.S. Bank Executive Vice President for Payments Operations, leader of the company's Proud to Serve Business Resource Group (BRG) and a third-generation U.S. Navy veteran. ""Through the course of their military career, servicemen and women develop many in-demand and unique skills - leadership, problem solving and teamwork - and we all benefit from their experience and expertise.""Frankie Kelley joined U.S. Bank through a virtual job fair hosted by Hiring Our Heroes. The Army Signal Support Communications Specialist completed two tours in Iraq, running cable and raising antennas to improve communication between operating bases. After shadowing other employees and training for several weeks, Kelley is now a gateway support technician with Elavon, a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank.""In this program, you feel like you are really a part of something special,"" he said. ""I feel like I am just beginning my next journey after the military, and I look forward to where I can grow from here.""U.S. Bank is proud to serve those who served in our armed forces.

30,42c524c8-4e77-3db3-a90b-65514290502f,JWN,2022-11-16,Nordstrom (JWN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-jwn-expected-beat-earnings-150003614.html,1668524403,STORY,"['JWN', 'URBN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Nordstrom (JWN) reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 22, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -66.7%.Revenues are expected to be $3.51 billion, down 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom?For Nordstrom, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Nordstrom will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nordstrom would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of +1.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nordstrom appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerUrban Outfitters (URBN), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.40 for the quarter ended October 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -55.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.16 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Urban Outfitters has been revised 6.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.07%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Urban Outfitters will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

31,7c4ecf59-af78-3ad5-90d7-27214297f7aa,XYL,2022-11-16,Dividend Investors: Don't Be Too Quick To Buy Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-investors-dont-too-quick-101302551.html,1668593582,STORY,['XYL'],"[It looks like Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Xylem's shares before the 21st of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.30 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.20 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Xylem has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current share price of $112.13. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Xylem has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Xylem If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Xylem paid out more than half (67%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 95% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.Xylem paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Xylem to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Xylem, with earnings per share up 4.0% on average over the last five years. Earnings have been growing somewhat, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Xylem has increased its dividend at approximately 11% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineIs Xylem worth buying for its dividend? Xylem is paying out a reasonable percentage of its income and an uncomfortably high 95% of its cash flow as dividends. At least earnings per share have been growing steadily. Bottom line: Xylem has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Xylem. For example - Xylem has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

This means the annual payment is 4.1% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.Huntington Bancshares has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 47%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 22.5%. The future payout ratio could be 43% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.16 total annually to $0.62. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.We Could See Huntington Bancshares' Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Huntington Bancshares has been growing its earnings per share at 9.1% a year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Huntington Bancshares Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Huntington Bancshares that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

35,7cb6f3aa-28ae-3cf8-a180-a81d5cdbf9a0,MGM,2022-11-16,Distance Yourself From These 4 Toxic Stocks to Avoid Losses,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/distance-yourself-4-toxic-stocks-124112227.html,1668516072,STORY,"['MGM', 'VWS.CO', 'IEP']","[One important criterion for successful investing is the accurate identification of overblown toxic stocks and the rightly priced ones. However, it is not easy to precisely distinguish these two categories of stocks. Investors who can figure out the toxic stocks correctly and dump them away at the right time are likely to gain at the end. Overhyped toxic stocks are usually vulnerable to outside shocks and burdened with a huge amount of debt. Also, the price of toxic stocks is unreasonably inflated. However, the high price of the toxic stocks is only temporary as it is higher than its intrinsic value.The unjustifiably high price of toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks associated with the stock. Owning such bloated stocks for an inordinate period can be corrosive to investors and may result in huge loss of wealth.Investors may benefit from the correct identification of toxic stocks with the help of an investing strategy known as short selling. This strategy allows them to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and abandoning them at an accurate time is the key to protecting your portfolio from big losses. Icahn Enterprises IEP, MGM Resorts International MGM, Vestas Wind Systems VWDRY and iHeartMedia Inc. IHRT are a few such toxic stocks.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and the next during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Story continuesZacks Rank more than #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy/Hold rated stocks that generally outperform or are in line the market.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Microchip Technology's shares before the 21st of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 6th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.33 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.31 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Microchip Technology has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current stock price of $76.94. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Microchip Technology paying out a modest 32% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 21% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Microchip Technology's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 54% per annum for the past five years. Microchip Technology is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Microchip Technology has delivered an average of 6.5% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Microchip Technology? Microchip Technology has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Microchip Technology looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Microchip Technology is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Microchip Technology and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

""The core belief is still this isn't going to cause an escalation. This is whatever it was, but it was not an attack on Poland and Biden’s comments took the tension out of it,"" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said.When the missile struck, NATO member Poland first said a Russian-made rocket was responsible and summoned Russia's ambassador to Warsaw for an explanation after Moscow denied it was responsible.The dollar, which acts a safe haven in times of geopolitical or market turmoil, rallied as much as 0.7% overnight, before tracking lower in European trading and was last down 0.3% against a basket of major currencies.""The initial reaction was understandable given that any deliberate strike on a NATO member would mark an enormous escalatory step,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.""It soon became apparent that this was highly unlikely to be a direct attack, and the overnight comments mentioned at the top suggest a rapid de-escalation.""Biden said the United States and its NATO allies were investigating the blast but early information suggested it may not have been caused by a missile fired from Russia.European shares slipped, with the STOXX 600 down 0.1%, while Germany's DAX dropped 0.7% and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.3%.Story continuesU.S. stock futures edged higher, with S&amp;P 500 e-minis and Nasdaq 100 futures both up 0.1%.The euro was last up 0.6% on the day at $1.0411, while sterling was roughly flat at $1.1865, after UK data showed consumer inflation picked up by a lot more than expected in October.With geopolitical tensions injecting some volatility into the broader markets, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were almost unchanged on the day at 3.807%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the broadcasting industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Broadcasting Companies in the World.The broadcasting industry has seen a paradigm shift in its dynamics after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of radio, newspapers, and televisions are now fading away in the past as digital streaming and digital broadcasting networks have experienced a sharp rise in consumption of late, with the likes of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime on the rise. According to research by Zenith, people spend more time than ever before viewing media, consuming about eight hours of media each day.Commercial broadcasting in the United States stretches back to the 1920s, when news bulletins, music programs, and live sporting events were first broadcasted into people's homes. Since then, the industry has continued to grow, and the U.S television industry alone stood at a market value of $210.4 billion in 2021, rising by $12.3 billion from 2020. Comcast Corporation and Fox Corporation remain two of the biggest broadcasting networks in the United States.However, it is interesting to note that although the sector keeps growing explosively in terms of its market size, the number of people employed in the US broadcasting sector has continued to fall in the past two decades. This is largely due to the rise of digital streaming platforms that require a substantially smaller number of people to operate as compared to radio or television.Digital platforms provide curated content to users as per their tastes and profiles. The overall experience is interactive and personalized for the user, which is what traditional media often lacks. Some examples of digital broadcasting companies include YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. The rise in traffic to digital streaming platforms has encouraged digital media companies to invest heavily in producing digital content. In 2020, Netflix invested $17 billion in content creation, up from $15.3 billion in 2019. The revenue for the digital streaming app industry is forecasted to reach $115 billion by 2026, from $72.2 billion in 2021.Story continuesPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization. In addition to TV, radio and telecommunications companies, we have also included major streaming companies in this list as they are taking the form of mainstream broadcasters as streaming replaces TV in households worldwide.15. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE)Market Cap: $1.51 billionParamount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) is a global media and entertainment corporation that develops content for viewers worldwide. The corporation has the industry's most important and vast libraries of TV and film titles. Its portfolio includes some of the top media networks, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Colors, VH1, and many more. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) also owns Simon &amp; Schuster, VidCon, and Bellator.

(NASDAQ:CHTR) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are included in our list of 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world.14. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS)Market Cap: $2.87 billionAltice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) is a French multinational mass media and telecommunication company. Altice USA, Inc. has spread its operation in four regions – Western Europe, Israel, the United States, and Overseas Territories. The company has become the second-largest telecommunication company in France. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) has over 50 million TV, phone, and internet corporate and residential customers. In 2017, the company expanded its online advertising business by acquiring Teads.The company's revenue for 2021 stood at $10.09 billion, recording an increase of 1.98% from $9.89 billion in 2020.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, MPE Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Two (very) costly mistakes I've made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) and Poshmark. Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality, I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up the case that we pay over intrinsic value, at worst case we should never lose money on an investment. I will dive into one of these mistakes below and maybe dive into the other in a future letter. My thinking when buying Altice USA was that they operate as a duopoly in their main footprint, the New York Tri-State area. They provide a needs-based service: internet, video, and voice services. I figured this is a very stable business with high barriers to entry. Management seemed competent as well based on historical capital allocation decisions. I didn't fully appreciate at the time how poorly positioned they were relative to Verizon Fios, as well as how fiercely competitive the business can get on promotions and customer acquisition.Altice offers hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) while Fios offers fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). FTTH is a far superior product, which has led to some share loss to Fios in the parts of their footprint that overlap. There have also been some subscriber losses in their other footprint due to new cable entrants and fixed wireless offerings (…read more)13.

DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS's cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish's long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration's infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.11.

The decline was primarily driven by a softening in investor sentiment towards News Corp's Digital Real Estate assets against a backdrop of rising interest rates in both Australia and the U.S., with REA Group shares down 17% during the quarter. While concerns over property market drivers are likely to continue in the near term, we see both REA Group and Move as being well positioned to structurally improve their businesses through this period.

(NYSE: FE), is completing a project to upgrade its distribution system in Crawford County to help prevent or minimize the length of service disruptions, particularly during severe winter weather. The work includes converting an existing power line to a higher voltage in the fast-growing commercial corridor along State Route 322 in Vernon Township and installing automated equipment on the local network to help prevent service disruptions and restore power faster for nearly 1,000 customers.Penelec Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The upgrades are part of Penelec's Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), a $200 million initiative to accelerate capital investments to the company's electric distribution system over five years and help ensure continued electric service reliability for customers.""We are reconstructing an existing power line to operate at a higher voltage, which will provide an alternate source of electricity to allow us to keep the lights on for many of our customers in the Vernon Township, Geneva and Conneaut Lake areas – including medical centers, big retail stores and restaurants – when our crews must make repairs or perform proactive maintenance,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania Operations. ""As part of the project, crews are relocating several sections of the power line from hard-to-reach wooded or swampy areas to Route 322 and North Watson Run Road to allow access for our bucket trucks and enable faster repairs.""Penelec is creating the new 5.5-mile, 34.5 kilovolt (kV) line by converting the existing 12-kV power line that runs along Route 322 west from Cutter Road to North Watson Run Road. The line then heads north along North Watson Run Road to Harmonsburg Road where it will connect with another 34.5-kV power line, reinforcing and providing redundancy to the local electric network.Story continuesThe work began in July and includes setting more than 100 new utility poles, hanging new wire with more electrical capacity along the entire length of the line and installing more than 70 new transformers. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.Four devices enabled with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technology are being placed at key spots along the line. SCADA conveys real-time information about voltage and electric current conditions to distribution system operators. Based on conditions, operators can control the devices remotely to quickly isolate damage and transfer customer load from one line to another, helping to keep the lights on for customers when problems such as vehicle accidents or tree-related outages occur.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fisher Asset Management founder Ken Fisher believes the Federal Reserve's actions will not help control inflation but also stressed that the U.S. economy is unlikely to plunge into recession, given that loan growth is ""robust."" He told Fox Business on November 3: “I don’t believe what the Fed is doing right now actually kills inflation. I don’t believe, as I have said before, that the Fed can kneecap the economy by raising rates the way it is because right now the banks' loan base cost them almost nothing. When the Fed raises short rates it increases the incentive for banks to make short-term loans because the spread gets bigger.”Ken Fisher recently pointed out some positive fundamentals that investors might be missing due to the uncertainty and short-term headwinds blanketing the stock market currently. In addition to strong bank loan growth, unemployment remains low in the United States, and travel is exceptionally robust and increasing. Historically, these factors are inconsistent with the beginnings of recessions, as per Fisher. Some of the top holdings in the Ken Fisher portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 stocks from the Ken Fisher portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksKen Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,604,616,000Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Fisher Asset Management held 11.8 million shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), worth $1.60 billion and representing 1.2% of the total 13F portfolio. Ken Fisher strengthened his hold on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by 3% in the September quarter. The stock has been part of the Fisher portfolio since the first quarter of 2014. Story continuesOn November 15, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) filed to exchange up to $2.75 billion of 3.500% senior notes due 2027. The filing also suggests an offering to exchange $3 billion of 3.850% senior notes due 2032, $2.75 billion of 4.450% senior notes due 2052, and $1.5 billion of 4.650% senior notes due 2062. Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps on November 10 reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) but lowered the price target on the shares to $170 from $200. The analyst said she trimmed her price target to factor in the latest multiple compression and views the layoffs and hiring freeze announcements as incrementally optimistic, particularly due to the ongoing macro uncertainty and the industry-wide weakness in digital advertising.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 184 hedge funds were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 200 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 7.3 million shares worth $1.17 billion. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also backed by Ken Fisher. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industry wide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,722,650,000Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, the United States, and internationally. Ken Fisher, as of Q3 2022, owns over 25 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) worth $1.7 billion, representing 1.29% of his total 13F portfolio. On November 10, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares climbed approximately 5% as the company said its October sales rose 56% year-over-year. For the month ending October 2022, the company generated NT$210.3 billion in revenue, up from NT$134.5 billion in the same period a year ago. Goldman Sachs analyst Bruce Lu downgraded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) on October 13 to Buy from Conviction Buy with a price target of $89, down from $126. The analyst noted that the company's management has turned ""more conservative"", given an impact from demand weakness, especially for its N7 nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) management has also guided down 2022 capex to $36 billion from nearly $40 billion, partially due to uncertain demand, the analyst told investors.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 72 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 81 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 14.6 million shares worth $1.19 billion. Baron Funds made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,830,503,000Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a California-based customer relationship management technology company, is one of the top picks from the Ken Fisher stock portfolio. Fisher owns 12.7 million shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) worth $1.8 billion as of Q3 2022, representing 1.37% of the total 13F securities. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz on November 15 maintained a Buy recommendation on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $225 from $235. Macro and geopolitical factors have continued to hammer the software sector, and many investors ""understandably remain cautious about increasing their software exposure at this time,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 116 hedge funds were long Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 114 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates held a prominent stake in the company, comprising more than 5 million shares worth $829 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Software has been a solid long-term performer for the Strategy and a key point of differentiation versus the benchmark. But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles.We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy. We also see significant room for margin expansion. While we have trimmed our Salesforce (CRM) exposure, we maintain confidence that the stock will re-rate to a level that reflects its growth potential.”7. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,949,619,000ASML Holding N.V.

Ken Fisher boosted his stake in the company by 3% in the third quarter. On November 10, ASML Holding N.V.

(NASDAQ:ASML) to EUR 745 from EUR 732 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 47 hedge funds were long ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), compared to 46 funds in the preceding quarter. Arrowstreet Capital held a significant position in the company, with 726,787 shares worth about $346 million. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $2,028,883,000American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that provides credit card products and travel-related services worldwide. As per the 13F filings for the third quarter of 2022, Ken Fisher owns over 15 million shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) worth $2 billion, representing 1.52% of the total portfolio. On October 21, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported a Q3 GAAP EPS of $2.47, beating market estimates by $0.06. The revenue of $13.56 billion climbed 24.1% year-over-year, falling short of Wall Street consensus by $20 million. Based on the company’s performance to date, it still expects full-year 2022 revenue growth of 23% to 25%, compared to a 25.24% consensus. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) now forecasts to clock in ahead of its original full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, versus a $9.84 consensus.Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti on October 24 reiterated an Overweight rating on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) but slashed the price target on the shares to $170 from $180 following the Q3 results. Increased funding costs have had a fairly neutral effect so far, though over time it will become a moderate headwind, the analyst contended.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 67 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 69 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest position holder in the company. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the top picks of Ken Fisher as of Q3 2022. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Construction Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Tech Companies in the WorldTop IoT Companies in the World Disclosure: None.

This number marks a dramatic increase when compared to 2021, when there were just over 11,000 reports for the entire year. Unfortunately, these numbers do not capture the full extent of overall scam attempts, as many go unreported.""Avoiding a scam is as simple as hanging up the phone. If you ever receive a call threatening disconnection if you do not make immediate payment, simply hang up and either call PG&amp;E to confirm your account details or log onto your account on PGE.com. Remember, PG&amp;E will never ask for you for your financial information over the phone or via email, nor will we request payment via pre-paid debit cards or other payment services like Zelle,"" said Aaron Johnson, PG&amp;E Bay Area regional vice president.Scammers are opportunistic and look for times when customers may be distracted or stressed, and the holiday season provides a prime opportunity for them. PG&amp;E will never send a single notification to a customer within one hour of a service interruption, and we will never ask customers to make payments with a pre-paid debit card, gift card, any form of cryptocurrency, or third-party digital payment mobile applications.""Utilities will continue to unite to combat scammers by spreading awareness and by working with telecom partners to remove access to phone lines for reported scammers. We encourage policymakers to adopt stronger public protections and encourage private citizens and small businesses to stay vigilant against scams,"" said UUAS Chair Bud Ajdukovic. ""Scams are on the rise, and these opportunistic criminals have used past crises such as the pandemic and natural disasters to target customers and small businesses when they are most vulnerable.""Story continuesScammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams.Signs of a potential scamThreat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively demand immediate payment for an alleged past due bill.Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to purchase a pre-paid card then call them back supposedly to make a bill payment.Request for pre-paid card: When the customer calls back, the caller asks the customer for the pre-paid card’s number, which grants the scammer instant access to the card’s funds.Refund or rebate offers: Scammers may say that your utility company overbilled you and owes you a refund, or that you are entitled to a rebate.How customers can protect themselvesCustomers should never purchase a pre-paid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&amp;E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person.If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill.Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts.Scammers Impersonating Trusted Phone Numbers: Scammers are now able to create authentic-looking 800 numbers which appear on your phone display. If called back, the numbers do not lead back to PG&amp;E. If a customer has doubts about the authenticity of the call, they should hang up and call PG&amp;E at 1-833-500-SCAM. If customers ever feel that they are in physical danger, they should call 911.Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with a scammer, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission’s website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information.For more information about scams, visit pge.com/scams or consumer.ftc.org.About UUASUUAS, a consortium of more than 150 U.S. and Canadian electric, water, and natural gas utilities and their respective trade associations, continues to raise customer awareness of common scams and new scam tactics being used by utility impostors. Through its work and with the help of customer reporting, UUAS has successfully helped to take nearly 13,000 toll-free numbers used by scammers against utility customers out of operation.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

As the frequency and intensity of weather events increases, it's not surprising that consumers are taking these issues into account when looking for a home. New research released today by Realtor.com® found that homebuyers generally show a preference for lower risk homes, which in turn appreciate at a slightly faster pace, and that the preference can be more pronounced in some areas of higher risk where awareness may be greater.Homes with less climate risk appreciate fasterHomes with a low risk of flood damage appreciate at 1.5 percentage points faster than homes with a high risk of flood damage. During the last flood-related disaster season (July - Sept. 2021), the growth rate gap increased to 1.7 percentage points, suggesting that flood risk was top-of-mind for buyers. Homes at low risk of wildfire appreciate at 3.7 percentage points faster than homes at high risk of wildfire. During the last wildfire season (July - Sept. 2021), the growth rate gap held steady at 3.7 percentage points, suggesting that awareness may be lower for wildfire than it is for flood.A recent Realtor.com® survey found that 71% of recent homebuyers considered the risk of natural disasters when deciding where to move and 47% are more concerned about natural disasters today than they were five years ago. Additionally, a 2021 Realtor.com® survey found that 34% of homeowners would consider moving or selling their home due to concerns about natural disasters.""Our data shows that users have a small but consistent preference toward lower risk homes. Buying a home is an extremely personal decision and many people are willing to take on more risk in order to have a water view or find a more affordable property,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""Consumers are increasingly aware of the risk that wildfires and flooding can have on their home. However, it's important to keep in mind that while climate-related risk is a factor that consumers might take into account, it is one of many considerations when deciding where to live and what home to purchase.""Story continuesHomebuyers weighing climate risks when shoppingHome shoppers on Realtor.com® who interact with the flood feature tend to shift toward viewing homes with lower risk than where they began. This is especially true in Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina where consumers shift to viewing details for homes with 5-7% lower risk scores. On the other hand, users in Mississippi shift from viewing homes with lower risk to homes with a higher risk of flooding, indicating that the users are willing to take some risk to find a property that meets their needs and may be more price sensitive.Wildfires seem to be less top-of-mind for home shoppers. In California, Oregon and Utah consumers who interact with the tool continue to look at homes with the same or similar risk scores. However, in Arizona, Florida and Mississippi, users of the tool tend to shift toward properties with higher risk, suggesting that awareness of wildfire risk might be lower than for flood or that consumers might be more price sensitive.""We felt that it was important to add natural disaster information to Realtor.com® to help home shoppers and homeowners better understand their risks and take preventative steps to help mitigate that risk,"" said Sara Brinton, lead product manager at Realtor.com®. ""In the two years since we added flood risk data to the site, it has become one of our most popular features and we're proud to be able to provide this important information to consumers so that they can make informed decisions during the home shopping process.""About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the broadcasting industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Broadcasting Companies in the World.The broadcasting industry has seen a paradigm shift in its dynamics after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of radio, newspapers, and televisions are now fading away in the past as digital streaming and digital broadcasting networks have experienced a sharp rise in consumption of late, with the likes of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime on the rise. According to research by Zenith, people spend more time than ever before viewing media, consuming about eight hours of media each day.Commercial broadcasting in the United States stretches back to the 1920s, when news bulletins, music programs, and live sporting events were first broadcasted into people's homes. Since then, the industry has continued to grow, and the U.S television industry alone stood at a market value of $210.4 billion in 2021, rising by $12.3 billion from 2020. Comcast Corporation and Fox Corporation remain two of the biggest broadcasting networks in the United States.However, it is interesting to note that although the sector keeps growing explosively in terms of its market size, the number of people employed in the US broadcasting sector has continued to fall in the past two decades. This is largely due to the rise of digital streaming platforms that require a substantially smaller number of people to operate as compared to radio or television.Digital platforms provide curated content to users as per their tastes and profiles. The overall experience is interactive and personalized for the user, which is what traditional media often lacks. Some examples of digital broadcasting companies include YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. The rise in traffic to digital streaming platforms has encouraged digital media companies to invest heavily in producing digital content. In 2020, Netflix invested $17 billion in content creation, up from $15.3 billion in 2019. The revenue for the digital streaming app industry is forecasted to reach $115 billion by 2026, from $72.2 billion in 2021.Story continuesPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization. In addition to TV, radio and telecommunications companies, we have also included major streaming companies in this list as they are taking the form of mainstream broadcasters as streaming replaces TV in households worldwide.15. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE)Market Cap: $1.51 billionParamount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) is a global media and entertainment corporation that develops content for viewers worldwide. The corporation has the industry's most important and vast libraries of TV and film titles. Its portfolio includes some of the top media networks, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Colors, VH1, and many more. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) also owns Simon &amp; Schuster, VidCon, and Bellator. The company was previously named ViacomCBS Inc. and renamed itself Paramount Global in February 2022.Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) revenue for 2021 was reported at $702.7 million, a 1% increase from the previous year's $695.9 million.In addition to Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are included in our list of 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world.14. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS)Market Cap: $2.87 billionAltice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) is a French multinational mass media and telecommunication company. Altice USA, Inc. has spread its operation in four regions – Western Europe, Israel, the United States, and Overseas Territories. The company has become the second-largest telecommunication company in France. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) has over 50 million TV, phone, and internet corporate and residential customers. In 2017, the company expanded its online advertising business by acquiring Teads.The company's revenue for 2021 stood at $10.09 billion, recording an increase of 1.98% from $9.89 billion in 2020.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, MPE Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Two (very) costly mistakes I've made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) and Poshmark. Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality, I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up the case that we pay over intrinsic value, at worst case we should never lose money on an investment. I will dive into one of these mistakes below and maybe dive into the other in a future letter. My thinking when buying Altice USA was that they operate as a duopoly in their main footprint, the New York Tri-State area. They provide a needs-based service: internet, video, and voice services. I figured this is a very stable business with high barriers to entry. Management seemed competent as well based on historical capital allocation decisions. I didn't fully appreciate at the time how poorly positioned they were relative to Verizon Fios, as well as how fiercely competitive the business can get on promotions and customer acquisition.Altice offers hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) while Fios offers fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). FTTH is a far superior product, which has led to some share loss to Fios in the parts of their footprint that overlap. There have also been some subscriber losses in their other footprint due to new cable entrants and fixed wireless offerings (…read more)13. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS)Market Cap: $3.09 billionZee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS) is an Indian company active in the content and broadcasting segments.

It boasts a collection with over 250,000 hours of television programs and rights to over 4,800 movie titles. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS) has a viewership of over 1.3 billion people in 173 countries.Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS) reported an annual revenue of $1.05 billion in 2021, up 1.94% from $1.03 billion in the previous year.12. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH)Market Cap: $7.50 billionDISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) was established in 1996 in the United States. The company has two main business subdivisions: Pay-Tv and Wireless. Pay-Tv subdivision offers its services under the DISH and the SLING brand. Pay-Tv has licenses to use Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) and Fixed Satellite Service (FSS), which offer video services to broadcasting networks and offers over-the-top (OTT) content. Wireless offers its customers postpaid and prepaid wireless services. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) invested approximately $20 billion into its Wireless 5G sector to acquire wireless spectrum licenses, including the 3.45-3.55 GHz band licenses.DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) revenue for 2021 stood at $17.88 billion, a 15.4% YoY increase from $15.49 billion in 2020.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Portfolio holdings in the communication services and financial sectors also made strong contributions. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS's cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish's long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration's infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.11. Vivendi SE (EPA:VIV)Market Cap: €9.24 billionVivendi SE (EPA:VIV) is mass media holding company founded in December 1987 and is headquartered in Paris, France.

The decline was primarily driven by a softening in investor sentiment towards News Corp's Digital Real Estate assets against a backdrop of rising interest rates in both Australia and the U.S., with REA Group shares down 17% during the quarter. While concerns over property market drivers are likely to continue in the near term, we see both REA Group and Move as being well positioned to structurally improve their businesses through this period. We continue to believe the News Corp assets are materially under-valued and remain supportive of ongoing initiatives to unlock value across the Group.9.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Microsoft could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Microsoft peKeen to find out how analysts think Microsoft's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Microsoft's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 3.5% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 75% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 14% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Microsoft's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Microsoft's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Microsoft maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Microsoft that you need to be mindful of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Microsoft, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fisher Asset Management founder Ken Fisher believes the Federal Reserve's actions will not help control inflation but also stressed that the U.S. economy is unlikely to plunge into recession, given that loan growth is ""robust."" He told Fox Business on November 3: “I don’t believe what the Fed is doing right now actually kills inflation. I don’t believe, as I have said before, that the Fed can kneecap the economy by raising rates the way it is because right now the banks' loan base cost them almost nothing. When the Fed raises short rates it increases the incentive for banks to make short-term loans because the spread gets bigger.”Ken Fisher recently pointed out some positive fundamentals that investors might be missing due to the uncertainty and short-term headwinds blanketing the stock market currently. In addition to strong bank loan growth, unemployment remains low in the United States, and travel is exceptionally robust and increasing. Historically, these factors are inconsistent with the beginnings of recessions, as per Fisher. Some of the top holdings in the Ken Fisher portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 stocks from the Ken Fisher portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksKen Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,604,616,000Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Fisher Asset Management held 11.8 million shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), worth $1.60 billion and representing 1.2% of the total 13F portfolio. Ken Fisher strengthened his hold on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by 3% in the September quarter. The stock has been part of the Fisher portfolio since the first quarter of 2014. Story continuesOn November 15, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) filed to exchange up to $2.75 billion of 3.500% senior notes due 2027. The filing also suggests an offering to exchange $3 billion of 3.850% senior notes due 2032, $2.75 billion of 4.450% senior notes due 2052, and $1.5 billion of 4.650% senior notes due 2062. Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps on November 10 reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) but lowered the price target on the shares to $170 from $200. The analyst said she trimmed her price target to factor in the latest multiple compression and views the layoffs and hiring freeze announcements as incrementally optimistic, particularly due to the ongoing macro uncertainty and the industry-wide weakness in digital advertising.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 184 hedge funds were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 200 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 7.3 million shares worth $1.17 billion. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also backed by Ken Fisher. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industry wide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,722,650,000Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, the United States, and internationally. Ken Fisher, as of Q3 2022, owns over 25 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) worth $1.7 billion, representing 1.29% of his total 13F portfolio. On November 10, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares climbed approximately 5% as the company said its October sales rose 56% year-over-year. For the month ending October 2022, the company generated NT$210.3 billion in revenue, up from NT$134.5 billion in the same period a year ago. Goldman Sachs analyst Bruce Lu downgraded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) on October 13 to Buy from Conviction Buy with a price target of $89, down from $126. The analyst noted that the company's management has turned ""more conservative"", given an impact from demand weakness, especially for its N7 nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) management has also guided down 2022 capex to $36 billion from nearly $40 billion, partially due to uncertain demand, the analyst told investors.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 72 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 81 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 14.6 million shares worth $1.19 billion. Baron Funds made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,830,503,000Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a California-based customer relationship management technology company, is one of the top picks from the Ken Fisher stock portfolio. Fisher owns 12.7 million shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) worth $1.8 billion as of Q3 2022, representing 1.37% of the total 13F securities. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz on November 15 maintained a Buy recommendation on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $225 from $235. Macro and geopolitical factors have continued to hammer the software sector, and many investors ""understandably remain cautious about increasing their software exposure at this time,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 116 hedge funds were long Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 114 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates held a prominent stake in the company, comprising more than 5 million shares worth $829 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Software has been a solid long-term performer for the Strategy and a key point of differentiation versus the benchmark. But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles.We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy. We also see significant room for margin expansion. While we have trimmed our Salesforce (CRM) exposure, we maintain confidence that the stock will re-rate to a level that reflects its growth potential.”7. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,949,619,000ASML Holding N.V.

Ken Fisher boosted his stake in the company by 3% in the third quarter. On November 10, ASML Holding N.V.

(NASDAQ:ASML) to EUR 745 from EUR 732 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 47 hedge funds were long ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), compared to 46 funds in the preceding quarter. Arrowstreet Capital held a significant position in the company, with 726,787 shares worth about $346 million. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $2,028,883,000American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that provides credit card products and travel-related services worldwide.

The revenue of $13.56 billion climbed 24.1% year-over-year, falling short of Wall Street consensus by $20 million. Based on the company’s performance to date, it still expects full-year 2022 revenue growth of 23% to 25%, compared to a 25.24% consensus. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) now forecasts to clock in ahead of its original full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, versus a $9.84 consensus.Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti on October 24 reiterated an Overweight rating on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) but slashed the price target on the shares to $170 from $180 following the Q3 results. Increased funding costs have had a fairly neutral effect so far, though over time it will become a moderate headwind, the analyst contended.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 67 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 69 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest position holder in the company. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the top picks of Ken Fisher as of Q3 2022. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Construction Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Tech Companies in the WorldTop IoT Companies in the World Disclosure: None.

With Q3 earnings season coming to a close and several mega-cap stocks down meaningfully year-to-date, there is a chance for insiders to extend a vote of confidence by buying up their own company shares.Investors giving up on stocks because of recession fears amid an uncertain market backdrop may want to reconsider their actions, as insiders at prominent companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) are going on buying sprees. It is also a good idea to observe billionaire money managers like Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which controls a $20 billion stock portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. In an interview with Barron’s on November 11, Dalio explained his outlook on the economy in the following words: “When the next big downturn occurs, and the economic pain is greater than the inflation pain, you will see the Fed and other central banks continue money-printing to monetize debt. Then, real rates will go down again, money will become cheaper and more plentiful, and inflation-hedge assets and new innovation/technology-company equities will be most attractive.”Our Methodology We used Ray Dalio’s hedge fund Q3 2022 portfolio for this analysis, selecting his largest stock positions which have also had an insider purchase in the last 6 months. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling IntoStocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into10.

Shares rose 4.6%, contributing to results as elevated market volatility and rising interest rates led to higher trading activity on CME’s exchanges. Average daily trading volume increased 19% year-over-year with notable strength in Interest Rates and Equities products. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, underpinned by its product breadth and liquidity depth, as well as its sustainable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures while also benefiting from the rising rate environment.”7. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 11.4 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $642.3 million and representing 3.25% of the total portfolio.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 400 million shares worth over $25 billion. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the re-franchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social media for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”6.

We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Investment Companies in the WorldBiggest ESG Companies in the WorldBiggest LPG Shipping Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social media for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines.

81,48f65a12-7349-348d-a967-47c99e182e92,ADM,2022-11-16,5 Solid Stocks to Play a Topsy-Turvy Wall Street,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-solid-stocks-play-topsy-144302870.html,1668523382,STORY,['ADM'],"[Major stock indexes in the United States posted their biggest gains in months last week on signs of inflation moderating. Soft inflation data, undeniably, bolstered expectations among investors that there could be a shift in the Federal Reserve’s present hawkish stance, which is unfavorably impacting consumers’ spending habits and deterring economic growth.For the week, the broader S&amp;P 500 jumped almost 6%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq climbed around 8%. Similarly, the Dow notched a gain of more than 5% for the week and is apparently on track to register its best October on record. After all, the consumer price index, a primary inflation barometer, logged its smallest 12-month jump last month since January.However, stocks at large snapped last week’s winning streak, with all the major bourses closing in the negative territory on Nov 14. This is because Fed governor Christopher J. Waller cautioned that the Fed’s fight to curb inflation has “ways to go.”Waller believes that investors have overreacted to the inflation data. And rightly so, since prices of household staple items like food, shelter and energy continue to rise at a record pace, as mentioned by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics last week.A New York Fed’s monthly survey also added that inflation is projected to rise to 5.9% on worries that there can be an unforeseen jump in gasoline prices in the near term. Respondents expect gas prices to jump 4.8% next year. In fact, the survey’s three-year as well as five-year inflation outlook also accelerated.Thus, the Fed could easily tighten its monetary policy further, leading to higher borrowing costs and further gyration in the stock market. Lest we forget, the stock market did rally in the months of July and August on hopes that the Fed may slow down its rate hikes.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had clarified that the Fed isn’t going to back down on its commitment to fight inflation, which is anyhow way ahead of its target of 2%. This eventually led to higher bouts of market volatility.Story continuesHence, with the broader stock market struggling for direction as investors continue to gauge the Fed’s policy path, it’s prudent to invest in stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns at this point in time. Stocks that are less volatile than the markets they trade in, or in other words, low beta stocks (ranges from 0 to 1) have been considered.But low-beta stocks provide fewer returns. Therefore, stocks that offer positive earnings estimate revisions, predominantly in the past two-month period, have also been well thought-out. Rising earnings estimates indicate that the company is fundamentally sound, and is well-poised to outperform the market in the near future. To top it, these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Archer Daniels Midland ADM is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.ADM currently has a beta of 0.85.

Recently, ADM crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.The 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Moving Average Chart for ADMADM could be on the verge of another rally after moving 9.9% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account ADM's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 7 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Given this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on ADM for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.87%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.17%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.23%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of software used to test and develop chips had gained 14.32% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 9.87% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 10.5% in that time.Synopsys will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 30, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Synopsys to post earnings of $1.84 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 1.1%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.28 billion, up 11.01% from the prior-year quarter.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Synopsys should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.09% lower within the past month. Synopsys is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Synopsys has a Forward P/E ratio of 32.38 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.18.Story continuesWe can also see that SNPS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.

The report examines the results of 4,300 security tests conducted on 2,700 software targets, including web applications, mobile applications, source code files, and networks systems (i.e., software or systems). The majority of the security tests were intrusive ""black box"" or ""gray box"" tests, including penetration testing, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and mobile application security testing (MAST), designed to probe running applications as a real-world attacker would.Eighty-two percent of the test targets were web applications or systems, 13% were mobile applications, and the remainder were either source code or network systems/applications. Industries represented in the tests included software and internet, financial services, business services, manufacturing, consumer services, and healthcare.In the 4,300 tests conducted, 95% of the targets were found to have some form of vulnerability (a 2% decrease from last year's findings). Twenty percent of the targets had high-risk vulnerabilities (a 10% decrease from last year), and 4.5% had critical vulnerabilities (a 1.5% decrease from last year).The results demonstrate that the best approach to security testing is to utilize the wide spectrum of tools available including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and software composition analysis to help ensure an application or system is free from vulnerabilities. For example, 22% of the total test targets had some exposure to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, one of the most prevalent and destructive high-/critical-risk vulnerabilities impacting web applications. Many XSS vulnerabilities occur when the application is running. The good news is that the exposure identified in this year's findings were 6% lower than last year's findings—meaning that organizations are taking proactive measures to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities in their production applications.Story continues""This research underscores that intrusive black box testing techniques like DAST and pen testing are particularly effective for surfacing exploitable vulnerabilities in the software development lifecycle and should be part of any well-rounded application security testing regimen,"" said Girish Janardhanudu, vice president, security consulting at Synopsys Software Integrity Group.Additional report highlightsOWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities were discovered in 77% of the targets. Application and server misconfigurations were 18% of the overall vulnerabilities found in the tests (a 3% decrease from last year's findings), represented by the OWASP A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration category. And 18% of the total vulnerabilities found were related to the OWASP A01:2021 – Broken Access Control category (a 1% decrease from last year).The urgent need for a software Bill of Materials. Vulnerable third-party libraries were found in 21% of the penetration tests conducted (an increase of 3% over last year's findings). This corresponds with the 2021 OWASP Top 10 category A06:2021—Use of Vulnerable and Outdated Components. Most organizations use a mix of custom-built code, commercial off-the-shelf code, and open source components to create the software they sell or use internally. Often those organizations have informal—or no—inventories detailing exactly what components their software is using, as well as those components' licenses, versions, and patch status. With many companies having hundreds of applications or software systems in use, each themselves likely having hundreds to thousands of different third-party and open source components, an accurate, up-to-date software Bill of Materials is urgently needed to effectively track those components.Lower-risk vulnerabilities can also be exploited to facilitate attacks. Seventy-two percent of the vulnerabilities discovered in the tests are considered low- or medium-risk. That is, the issues found are not directly exploitable by attackers to gain access to systems or sensitive data. Nonetheless, resurfacing these vulnerabilities isn't an empty exercise, as even lower-risk vulnerabilities can be exploited to facilitate attacks. For example, verbose server banners—found in 49% of the DAST tests and 42% of the pen tests—provide information such as server name, type, and version number that could allow attackers to perform targeted attacks on specific technology stacks.To learn more, download the ""Software Vulnerability Snapshot: The 10 Most Common Web Application Vulnerabilities"" or read the blog post.About the Synopsys Software Integrity GroupSynopsys Software Integrity Group provides integrated solutions that transform the way development teams build and deliver software, accelerating innovation while addressing business risk.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Roper Technologies basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Roper Technologies, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Roper Technologies to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, the figure increased 1.7% year over year.Its results were aided by a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. This retail REIT behemoth also raised its 2022 comparable FFO per share outlook from $11.70-$11.77 to $11.83-$11.88.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased marginally upward over the past week.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us now decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price.Improving Leasing Environment: The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. As a result, Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad has been experiencing solid leasing activity.For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, it signed 983 new leases and 1,116 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.Healthy Operating Performance: The occupancy for Simon Property’s U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio improved 170 basis points year over year to 94.5% as of Sep 30, 2022. Also, the base-minimum rent per square foot for this portfolio was $54.80 as of Sep 30, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Sep 30, 2021.   During the third quarter, the retailer sales touched another record high of $749 per square foot for the malls and the outlets combined. This reflected an increase of 14% year-over-year.Focus on Omni-Chanel Strategy: Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omni-channel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, has enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: The company maintains a solid balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited third-quarter 2022 with $8.6 billion of liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 5.0, which is well ahead of the required level. SPG also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.SPG’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 54.59% compared with the industry’s average of 6.27%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.In addition, its current cash flow growth is projected at 44.90% compared with the 26.69% growth estimated for the industry.With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Dividends: Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and SPG has consistently raised its dividend rates. Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings release on Nov 1, 2022, SPG announced a 2.9% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.80 per share. Prior to this, the company increased its third-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.75 per share from $1.70 paid earlier. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers, affecting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores. Also, interest rate hikes add to its concerns.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regency Centers’ current-year FFO per share is currently pegged at $3.97.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has presently stands at $6.24.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Assets Trust’s 2022 FFO per share is pegged at $2.26, presently.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into. Amid a volatile stock market environment, investors are turning towards insiders, billionaires, and famous money managers, in order to replicate their trades or get an idea about the near-term outlook based on their market moves. With Q3 earnings season coming to a close and several mega-cap stocks down meaningfully year-to-date, there is a chance for insiders to extend a vote of confidence by buying up their own company shares.Investors giving up on stocks because of recession fears amid an uncertain market backdrop may want to reconsider their actions, as insiders at prominent companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) are going on buying sprees. It is also a good idea to observe billionaire money managers like Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which controls a $20 billion stock portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. In an interview with Barron’s on November 11, Dalio explained his outlook on the economy in the following words: “When the next big downturn occurs, and the economic pain is greater than the inflation pain, you will see the Fed and other central banks continue money-printing to monetize debt. Then, real rates will go down again, money will become cheaper and more plentiful, and inflation-hedge assets and new innovation/technology-company equities will be most attractive.”Our Methodology We used Ray Dalio’s hedge fund Q3 2022 portfolio for this analysis, selecting his largest stock positions which have also had an insider purchase in the last 6 months. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling IntoStocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into10.

On June 21, 2022, an insider also purchased 1,000 units of Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)’s common stock. Story continuesOn November 1, Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) reported its financial results for the quarter ending September 2022. The company posted a non-GAAP EPS of $0.97, falling short of market estimates by $0.02.

Despite the FQ1 earnings miss, the analyst is optimistic about Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)’s efforts to offset weak food sales to restaurants and hotels by controlling costs and focusing on sales to grocery stores. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 32 hedge funds were bullish on Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 31 funds in the prior quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners held the biggest stake in the company, comprising 8.8 million shares worth about $745 million. Like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Booking Holdings Inc.

He lifted his FY23 EPS estimate to $3.39 from $3.25, which now reflects U.S. same-store sales growth of 8.5%, up from 7.5%.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 55 hedge funds were long Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 58 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw held a prominent stake in the company, comprising 2.68 million shares worth $204.7 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance.

Average daily trading volume increased 19% year-over-year with notable strength in Interest Rates and Equities products. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, underpinned by its product breadth and liquidity depth, as well as its sustainable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures while also benefiting from the rising rate environment.”7.

Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the re-franchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social media for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”6.

(NYSE:GPN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.25 per share on the 30th of December. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.0%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. See our latest analysis for Global Payments Global Payments' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 376% of what it was earning, however the dividend was quite comfortably covered by free cash flows at a cash payout ratio of only 16%. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 19% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.04 total annually to $1.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 38% a year over that time. Global Payments has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Earnings per share has been sinking by 31% over the last five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Schlumberger and Core Laboratories are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.SLB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 25.41, while CLB has a forward P/E of 40.43. We also note that SLB has a PEG ratio of 0.64. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.83.Another notable valuation metric for SLB is its P/B ratio of 4.38. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CLB has a P/B of 5.69.These metrics, and several others, help SLB earn a Value grade of B, while CLB has been given a Value grade of C.Both SLB and CLB are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that SLB is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,d887ea5b-042f-36f3-9421-5407c1c4d81b,HOLX,2022-11-16,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-attracting-investor-140002372.html,1668520802,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned +17.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +10.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has gained 12.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, indicating a change of -59.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +12.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 points to a change of -42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $962.24 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -34.6%. The $3.81 billion and $4.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.6% and +5.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Are you still watching? Ticker symbol N-F-L-X in focus after a Bank of America analyst double upgraded the streaming giant to buy from underperform, citing the company's monetization efforts for making it an attractive stock despite slowing subscriber growth here. And they're potentially just looking through-- and they actually did cite the ad tier.But that ad tier is going to have increasing competition. Disney is rolling out its ad tier. And you're gonna see more of the customers having to try and figure out how many subscriptions they want to have to have in the household that they're continuing to pay for, while prices have increased as well on a relative year-over-year basis.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'm liking-- I think I have this right, but this is the second note this week from B of A where they did the double downgrade. The other one was Hasbro, I believe, yesterday.JULIE HYMAN: No, this is double upgrade.BRIAN SOZZI: Double upgrade. This is double grade. Hasbro was double downgrade. I like the doubles. Make a buy or sell decision. I've been a big proponent of that. Don't go neutral. Don't go hold.But here with Netflix, I would say nothing new, per se. Just another analyst, I think, that is very bullish on the streaming-- obviously, the streaming opportunity longer term but also the ad business for this company.JULIE HYMAN: And one more thing to mention, I don't think we've mentioned it yet. The analyst behind this is Jessica Reif Cohen, who is broadly followed and respected as a media analyst within the industry. So that's just something to know, too, is, you know, we talk about analyst notes all day long. They're not all equal weight, so to speak, to use their language, right? There are some who are more watched than others. And I-- she is likely in that category.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Very good note.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Very good note.]"

The Company’s above-plan third quarter Fiscal 2023 pretax profit margin was largely due to a benefit from the timing of expenses, most of which the Company expects will reverse out in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023. Merchandise margin was flat despite 1.2 percentage points of incremental freight costs. Merchandise margin benefitted from strong markon mostly due to better buying. Incremental wage costs negatively impacted pretax profit margin by 0.8 percentage points.Gross profit margin for the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 was 29.1%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease versus the third quarter of Fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs as a percent of sales for the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 were 18.0%, a 0.3 percentage point decrease versus the third quarter of Fiscal 2022.Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a three percentage point negative impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.01 negative impact on third quarter Fiscal 2023 earnings per share.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a two percentage point negative impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the first nine months of Fiscal 2023 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.02 negative impact on the first nine months of Fiscal 2023 earnings per share.A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX’s pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of TJX.com.The foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which the Company refers to as ""transactional foreign exchange.""InventoryTotal inventories as of October 29, 2022 were $8.3 billion, compared with $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2022. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of October 29, 2022, including distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit, the Company’s e-commerce sites, and Sierra stores, were up 27% on a reported basis (up 31% on a constant currency basis). The Company is very comfortable with its inventory position and is set up extremely well to deliver an ever-changing assortment of exciting brands and gifts to its stores and online this holiday season.Cash and Shareholder DistributionsFor the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash.During the third quarter, the Company returned $843 million to shareholders. The Company repurchased a total of $500 million of TJX stock, retiring 7.7 million shares, and paid $343 million in shareholder dividends during the quarter. For the first nine months of Fiscal 2023, the Company returned a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders, which includes repurchasing a total of $1.8 billion of TJX stock, retiring 29.1 million shares, and paying $1.0 billion in shareholder dividends. The Company continues to expect to repurchase approximately $2.25 to $2.50 billion of TJX stock in Fiscal 2023. The Company may adjust this amount up or down depending on various factors.Divesture of FamiliaDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company completed the divestiture of its minority investment in Familia. As a result, the Company realized a $54 million tax benefit, which increased third quarter Fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share by $.05.Full Year and Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 OutlookFor the full year Fiscal 2023, the Company is maintaining the high end of its outlook for adjusted pretax profit margin. The Company expects pretax profit margin to be 9.3% to 9.4% and adjusted pretax profit margin to be 9.8% to 9.9%. The Company’s adjusted pretax profit margin plan excludes a 0.4 percentage point negative impact from the first quarter Fiscal 2023 charge related to a write-down of the Company’s minority investment in Familia.For the full year Fiscal 2023, the Company now expects diluted earnings per share to be $2.93 to $2.97 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $3.07 to $3.11. The change in the high end of the Company’s full year Fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share outlook is a result of an expected $.02 negative impact due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The Company’s adjusted diluted earnings per share plan excludes the negative impact from the first quarter Fiscal 2023 charge related to a write-down of the Company’s minority investment in Familia, as well a third quarter Fiscal 2023 tax benefit related to the divestiture of its minority investment in Familia.For the full year Fiscal 2023, the Company is increasing its outlook for U.S. comparable store sales and is now planning a decrease of 1% to 2% versus a 17% U.S. open-only comp store sales increase in Fiscal 2022.For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company now expects pretax profit margin to be 9.5% to 9.8% and diluted earnings per share to be $.85 to $.89. This guidance now assumes that most of the third quarter Fiscal 2023 timing of expenses benefit will reverse out in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company is increasing its outlook for U.S. comparable store sales and is now planning them to be flat to up 1% versus a 13% U.S. open-only comp store sales increase in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022.Stores by ConceptDuring the third quarter ended October 29, 2022, the Company increased its store count by 57 stores to a total of 4,793 stores and increased square footage by 1.0% over the previous quarter.Store Locations1Gross Square Feet2Third Quarter FY2023Third Quarter FY2023(in millions)BeginningEndBeginningEndIn the U.S.:T.J.

While stores in the U.S. were open for all of Fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in TJX Canada and TJX International (Europe and Australia) experienced COVID-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during Fiscal 2022. Therefore, the Company cannot measure year-over-year comparable store sales with Fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. As a result, the comparable stores included in the Fiscal 2023 measure consist of U.S. stores only, which, for clarity, the Company refers to as U.S. comparable store sales and are calculated against sales for the comparable periods in Fiscal 2022.Fiscal 2022 Open-Only Comp Store SalesDue to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company’s historical definition of comp store sales was not applicable in Fiscal 2022. In order to provide a performance indicator for its stores, the Company temporarily reported open-only comp store sales. The Company’s open-only comp store sales calculation includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of Fiscal 2021. This measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in Fiscal 2022 against sales for the same days in Fiscal 2020, prior to the emergence of the global pandemic.Global Corporate Responsibility ReportIn the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, TJX published its 2022 Global Corporate Responsibility Report, summarizing the Company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts and progress from Fiscal 2022. The latest report includes information on the Company’s environmental sustainability goals, details progress within its inclusion and diversity efforts, and highlights a variety of programs and data from across the Company’s four reporting areas of Workplace, Communities, Environmental Sustainability, and Responsible Business.Through this report, the Company continues to provide an appendix of ESG data and information, including indices that map the Company’s public disclosures to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework.TJX has been reporting on its corporate responsibility efforts for more than 10 years and through this work, strives to make a meaningful impact on the world, reflecting its core values of honesty, integrity, and treating each other with dignity and respect.

Non-GAAP financial measures refer to financial information adjusted to exclude or include, as applicable from financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), items identified in this press release. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release include adjusted diluted earnings per share, total U.S. net sales, constant currency sales growth, and adjusted pretax profit margin. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted financial results is useful to investors as it provides additional information on comparisons between periods by excluding certain items that affect overall comparability. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes, to consider underlying trends of its business, and in measuring its performance relative to others in the market, and believes presenting these measures also provides information to investors and others for understanding and evaluating trends in the Company’s operating results or measuring performance in the same manner as the Company’s management. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

StatementsDuring the third quarter ended October 29, 2022, the Company returned over $0.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing and retiring 7.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.5 billion on a ""trade date"" basis and paying $0.3 billion in shareholder dividends. During the nine months ended October 29, 2022, the Company returned a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing and retiring 29.1 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.8 billion on a ""trade date"" basis and paying $1.0 billion in shareholder dividends. In February 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, with $2.0 billion still remaining on all previously authorized programs at October 29, 2022. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.During the third quarter ended October 29, 2022, the Company completed its divestiture of its minority investment in Familia, an off-price retailer that operates in Russia, which resulted in a $54 million tax benefit, or $.05 positive impact, to diluted earnings per share.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Dollar General and TJX are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that DG has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.35, while TJX has a forward P/E of 23.48. We also note that DG has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.24.Another notable valuation metric for DG is its P/B ratio of 9. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TJX has a P/B of 15.72.Based on these metrics and many more, DG holds a Value grade of B, while TJX has a Value grade of C.DG has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TJX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DG is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PSE&amp;G urges customers to understand scammers' tactics and know what to do if confronted with a request for private account information or a demand for immediate payment. If customers are ever in doubt about the legitimacy of a contact from PSE&amp;G, they should call PSE&amp;G at 800-436-PSEG (7734).Utilities United Against Scams (UUAS) is supporting International Fraud Awareness Week, and will recognize the seventh annual Utility Scam Awareness Day on Wednesday, November 16. Utility Scam Awareness Day was designated to raise awareness, educate customers, and expose the tactics used by scammers.""Protecting our customers is a top priority. It is critically important we continue to raise awareness and educate customers about how to spot and stop potential scams,"" said David Johnson, PSE&amp;G chief customer officer and vice president of Customer Care. ""Scammers continue to adapt and develop increasingly sophisticated tactics to take advantage of our customers.""According to information provided to PSE&amp;G by its customers in 2022 - roughly 1,000 customers reported they were a victim of a utility scam or scam attempt.Scammer tactics are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but utility impostor scams are oftentimes as simple as a scammer posing as a customer's local utility representative in person or over the phone.""Customers shouldn't be afraid to end the interaction if they suspect it is a scam. You can always call PSE&amp;G to confirm,"" said Johnson. ""Customers will always receive prior notification of past-due balances on their PSE&amp;G bill, and by mail, email or phone, before the possibility of service disconnection. We also work hard to educate about the options available to help them pay their bill.""PSE&amp;G urges customers to learn how to spot and stop potential utility scam activity.Story continuesSigns of potential utility scam activity:Threat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively tell the customer their utility bill is past due and service will be disconnected if a payment is not made - usually within an hour.Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to purchase a prepaid card, a gift card or even Bitcoin, and then to call them back to make a phone payment. They may request that the customer use a payment app to make an online payment, or even give instructions for an in-person meeting. Many times, after the customer makes the first payment, the scammer will call back to ask for the payment to be resubmitted due to an error with the amount. The scammer refers to a new amount and claims that the original payment will be refunded.Request for card information: If a customer calls back with requested information, the scammer asks the customer for the prepaid card's number or gift-card PIN, which grants the scammer instant access to the card's funds, and the victim's money is gone.In person-demands: Scammers may arrive at a home or business, flash a fake ID and/or claim to be a utility collection representative. The impostors may wear ""uniforms"" or affix false company signs to their vehicles. The scammers generally ask for personal information or offer discounts, which a real PSE&amp;G representative would not do.Protect yourself against utility scams:Be alert to the telltale sign of a scam: someone asking by telephone or email for payment in pre-paid debit cards or fund transfer app, or to send money to an out-of-state address.Never arrange payment or provide account or personal information, including Social Security numbers or debit/credit card information, in person or over the telephone unless you are certain you are speaking to a PSE&amp;G representative.Customers should also know what PSE&amp;G will and won't discuss over the phone. A genuine PSE&amp;G representative will ask to speak to the ""Customer of Record."" If that person is available, the representative will explain why they are calling and provide the account name, address and current balance. If the person on the phone does not provide the correct information, it is likely the customer is not speaking with a PSE&amp;G representative.If the ""Customer of Record"" is not available, the PSE&amp;G representative will not discuss the account at all and ask that a message be left for the ""Customer of Record"" to call 1-800-357-2262.If customers have doubts about the legitimacy of a call or an email - especially one in which payment is requested - they should call PSE&amp;G directly at 1-800-436-PSEG (7734).For more information on scams, visit pseg.com/scamalert.How to identify a PSE&amp;G employee in your neighborhood:Typically, any employee working in your neighborhood will be in a vehicle that displays the PSE&amp;G logo. In some cases, meter readers and contractors working on behalf of PSE&amp;G may drive their personal cars.All employees are required to wear company-issued identification badges around their neck or on their belt. They should introduce themselves as a way to establish their identity.If you feel uneasy in a situation, ask them to wait outside and call PSE&amp;G directly at 1-800-436-PSEG (7734) to verify if someone from PSE&amp;G is in your area.Why a PSE&amp;G employee or contractor might show up ""unexpectedly"":There are several situations when a PSE&amp;G employee or contractor may show up unexpectedly, including to:Read or replace meters.Investigate a suspicious odor or gas leak.Complete field inspections of infrastructure.Attend to a customer's high bill complaint.Respond to emergencies to shut off power for first responders.For more information on how to identify a PSE&amp;G employee or contractor, visit Energize!.*Customers are not required to report utility scam attempts or losses to PSE&amp;G.

James Harvey II, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2011. During his career with PSE&amp;G, Harvey had served as a substation operator and division mechanic assistant in the Metropolitan Division.Following an opening presentation of the colors by an honor guard, Health &amp; Safety Coordinator Bridgette Reilley played Call to Colors on the trumpet. After the singing of the National Anthem by ESOC Training Instructor Simone Duncan, the program continued with a moment of silence in Harvey's memory, after which several guest speakers paid tribute to Harvey.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Monday, November 14, 2022, Press release picturePhoto: Speakers (l-r): Tom Kelly, USN, IBEW National Chairman, Mike Butler, Jack Bridges, Karl Wintermeyer, Alex Arroyo and Tim Gonzales""I have been amazed at how many co-workers have been touched by his life,"" said Mike Butler, PSE&amp;G lineman, U.S. Army, and chairman of IBEW Local 94's Veterans Committee. ""The outpouring of support today is a testament to James's character.""In their remarks, both Jack Bridges, PSE&amp;G vice president Electric Operations and John Latka, PSE&amp;G senior vice president Electric Transmission &amp; Distribution, spoke of the memories of Harvey that his co-workers had shared.""It's worth noting that memories of Jimmy remain fresh and clear in the minds of those who had the privilege of working with him during his time with the Metro Division,"" Bridges said. ""Jimmy was respected for the quality of the work he did and, more importantly, for his qualities as a friend who always looked to help others.""Latka recalled the words of one of his colleagues as representative of the high regard he was held in. ""This teammate wrote ‘Jim was just a really great guy that we were lucky to have in the department. He loved his country and was so proud to be doing his part to fight for it. I'm honored to have known him for the few short years we had with him.'""Story continuesMetro Division Operations Manager Karl Wintermeyer, U.S. Navy, shared comments from Major Lou Crist, Harvey's platoon commander. ""I'm convinced his actions saved my life and at least several others in the platoon. James was a warrior. We were all indeed very blessed to have him, and he ensured we all returned home.""The program's final speaker, Projects &amp; Construction Chief Lineman and combat veteran Alex Arroyo, U.S. Army, shared excerpts of Harvey's ‘last letter,' which deployed soldiers write in the event that anything happens to them during their tour.

This means the annual payment is 2.9% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Macy's Macy's' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Macy's was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.EPS is set to fall by 18.7% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 11%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.80 total annually to $0.63. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 2.4% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Macy's has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 21% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like Macy's' DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

M is likely to register both top- and bottom-line declines from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported numbers in its third-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 17, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5,175 million, suggesting a 4.9% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable at 19 cents per share in the past 30 days. The consensus mark indicates a decline from $1.23 a share earned in the year-earlier quarter. Macy's bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.7% in the last reported quarter. M has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 80.8%, on average.We expect revenues to be down 4.6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading to $5,192.4 million and adjusted earnings to plunge 84.1% to 20 cents per share in the quarter under review.Factors to NoteSoft consumer demand due to the inflationary environment and incremental promotional pressures is likely to have weighed on Macy’s third-quarter performance. Markdowns to optimize inventory levels within overstock categories and the possibility of an elevated promotional environment, given the high inventory levels, might have hurt margins and the bottom line. Also, deleveraged SG&amp;A expenses are concerns.On its last earnings call, management had expected third-quarter net sales of $5,160-$5,230 million, indicating a decline from the net sales of $5,440 million reported in the year-ago period. M had envisioned third-quarter adjusted earnings of 15-21 cents a share, suggesting a decrease from $1.23 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.Despite the aforementioned headwinds, we expect Macy’s solid execution of the Polaris strategy, robust omni-channel capabilities, curated merchandise assortment and initiatives to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience to have provided some cushion to its quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Macy’s this time around.

129,972dddd8-ac29-3cee-a0fd-336d197057d3,M,2022-11-16,Wall Street Analysts Think Macy's (M) Could Surge 26%: Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-macys-145502865.html,1668524102,STORY,['M'],"[Shares of Macy's (M) have gained 12.5% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $20.52, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $25.80 indicates a potential upside of 25.7%.The mean estimate comprises 10 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $4.73. While the lowest estimate of $18 indicates a 12.3% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 60.8% to reach $33. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in M. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for MHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why M Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, M currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much M could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

140,71745659-8e99-3dff-abd7-569cbf63b438,TSN,2022-11-16,Tyson Foods CFO has an interesting addition to the company’s earnings call—an apology for his arrest last week,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tyson-foods-cfo-interesting-addition-114418779.html,1668512658,STORY,['TSN'],"[Good morning,Well, I'll say this for Tyson's Monday earnings call—you don't hear that everyday.CFO John R. Tyson, who was arrested last week, participated in the company’s earnings call, his first as finance chief, on Monday. “I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions,” Tyson said. “I just want to apologize to our investors as I have to our employees. This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal values. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and that I'm committed to making sure this never happens again.""“Our independent board of directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter,” Tyson Foods, Inc. CEO and President Donnie King said. Tyson is the son of the company's chairman John H. Tyson.After addressing the elephant in the room, the call moved on to more typical topics in the Q&amp;A portion. One analyst pressed the executives about the result of automation and headcount. The company has made progress in deboning chicken, and pack-out automation across all businesses, King said. “The automation piece specifically is progressing faster than what we had planned.” He added, “We are eliminating difficult jobs and reassigning people to open positions throughout the company.” King didn't say how much of the workforce would be reduced.Automation is a component of the Tyson Foods productivity program (along with digital and operational and functional excellence) which aims to deliver more than $1 billion in recurring annual savings by the end of 2024. It's now ahead of schedule, King said. The company is expected to reach its goal by the end of fiscal 2023, he said.“We invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal year, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives,” Tyson said on the call.Automation in the food and consumer goods industry is making gains, according to research by the Association for Advancing Automation released in August. Fifty-nine percent of the 12,305 robots sold in Q2 2022 came from automotive industry orders. The remaining orders from non-automotive companies were largely in the food and consumer goods industry, which saw a 13% increase in unit orders over the same period, April through June, in 2021, according to the association.Story continuesWith automation comes a need to upskill and re-skill workers who require reassignment. A July McKinsey report recommends offering experiences and apprenticeships, not courses.Tyson Foods is also aiming to relocate 1,100 corporate employees to its headquarters in Springdale, Ark. coming from offices in downtown Chicago, its Downers Grove suburb, and Dakota Dunes, S.D. beginning early next year. But it’s not clear how many employees will remain with the company and move to Springdale.King noted that Monday was the deadline employees were given to make a decision. “We want you to remain a part of Tyson Foods,” King said the employees were told. “And quite frankly, I've been out recruiting people as other leaders have to come to Northwest Arkansas and we've had a lot of success.” For the people who aren’t able to relocate, “We will try to create an opportunity where they can stay with the company long enough so that their replacement could be hired and trained so we don’t have an interruption to business continuity.”The company’s earnings report showed that consumers are willing to pay up for chicken. For the company's fourth quarter, the average price of Tyson Foods chicken increased 18.2%. Chicken sales increased from $3.87 billion to $4.62 billion as volume rose 1.1%. Meanwhile, the average beef prices dropped 8.2%, and sales fell from $5.01 billion to $4.86 billion as volume rose 5.1%. The company's top line beat estimates, but the bottom line fell short.Regarding executive changes in finance, last month, Stewart Glendinning, CFO since 2017, became group president of prepared foods. Tyson succeeded him as CFO. Before joining the company in 2019, Tyson held roles in investment banking, private equity, and venture capital, including at J.P. Morgan.Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit Suisse, questioned how the “organization is responding culturally” to the “reshuffling” of leadership, which breaks from Tyson Foods's norm of “putting people into the CFO role who have 20 plus years of experience in the finance track,” for example.At Tyson Foods “our succession planning process is very robust,” King said. He also added, “I'm perfectly comfortable with the people we put in place.”See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comSign up here to receive CFO Daily weekday mornings in your inbox.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The Pandemic Housing Bubble is bursting—KPMG says prices falling 15% look ‘conservative’The American middle class is at the end of an eraMeet the 30-year-old who just became Europe’s wealthiest millennial after inheriting half of the Red Bull empireSam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each other]"
141,f794f502-505e-3a75-8a35-42c4360a07f9,MA,2022-11-16,Positive week for Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) institutional investors who lost 6.5% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-mastercard-incorporated-nyse-130020110.html,1668603620,STORY,['MA'],"[A look at the shareholders of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$17b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 6.5% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Mastercard, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Mastercard. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mastercard, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. With 8.0% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Mastercard Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$338m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Mastercard. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Using distributed ledger technology, the proposed platform would create innovation opportunities to improve financial settlements and would include participation from central banks, commercial banks of various sizes and regulated non-banks.The 12-week PoC will test a version of the RLN design that operates exclusively in U.S. dollars where commercial banks issue simulated digital money or ""tokens"" – representing the deposits of their own customers – and settle through simulated central bank reserves on a shared multi-entity distributed ledger. The PoC will also test the feasibility of a programmable digital money design that is potentially extensible to other digital assets, as well as the viability of the proposed system within existing laws and regulations.Members of the U.S. banking and payments community involved in this PoC (as listed further below) are pleased to be working alongside the New York Innovation Center (NYIC) that is part of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The NYIC collaborates with the private and public sectors on innovations aimed at enhancing the functioning of the global financial system and the ability of central banks to carry out their missions. For information from the New York Innovation Center on this collaboration, see here.Other key aspects of the PoC include:Regulatory framework: The platform will align with the existing regulatory framework and preserve existing requirements for deposit-based payments processing, notably maintaining know your customer and anti-money laundering requirements.Scope: The PoC will simulate digital money issued by regulated institutions in U.S. dollars, although the concept could potentially be extended to multi-currency operations and regulated stablecoins.Tokens: The PoC will simulate tokens that are 100% fungible and redeemable with other forms of money.Industry collaboration: The PoC will include dialogue with the broader U.S. banking community, including community and regional banks.Results: Following the conclusion of the PoC, the banking group will publicize the results, which they hope will be an important contribution to the literature on digital money.Future plans: The banking group participants are not committed to any future phases of work once the PoC has been completed.Story continuesThis project will be conducted in a test environment and only use simulated data. It is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome, nor is it intended to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a retail or wholesale CBDC, nor how one would necessarily be designed. The findings of the pilot project will be released after it concludes.In addition to the NYIC, the other participants on this project include the following financial institutions and payments organizations: BNY Mellon, Citi, HSBC, Mastercard, PNC Bank, TD Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

And this will speed that whole process up immensely,"" Steve Walker, chief technology officer, Lockheed said an interview, declining to provide an estimate of the project's total cost.Microsoft has made a ""substantial investment"" and spent more than seven years building the classified cloud being used by the Department of Defense, Zach Kramer, general manager, Mission Engineering at Microsoft Corp said in the joint interview with Lockheed.""For us, it's a question of expanding the usage of the assets we've already put in (the) market. And really what that does is enable the collaboration with others,"" Kramer said, such as the Department of Defense or, once they join a classified cloud program, suppliers.Lockheed will use Microsoft's cloud-based gaming, exercising, modeling and simulation tools to test military systems and technologies virtually, saving time and money versus more expensive testing of prototypes or in-person exercises.The new cloud will also allow the company to identify cyber threats and potential hacks, executives said.(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Stephen Coates)]"

The average selling price of US$433 is still lower than the current share price, or in other words, insiders would have been better off holding on to their shares.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, for US$3.5m worth of shares, at about US$438 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$467. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Lockheed Martin insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. insider John Donovan spent US$251k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$82m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The more recent transactions are a positive, but Lockheed Martin insiders haven't shown the sustained enthusiasm that we look for, although they do own a decent number of shares, overall. So they seem pretty well aligned, overall. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

This put it on a trajectory to break away from the gravity of the Earth and make its way to the Moon.""We're witnessing history as Artemis I brings us one significant step closer to making NASA's vision for human deep space exploration a reality,"" said Robert Lightfoot, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Space. ""Through a nationwide industry team that has also leveraged an international industrial base, this launch and mission unite the skills of a dedicated workforce and innovative technologies to make a global impact.""With this successful launch, the planned 25.5-day mission has begun. It will initially take several days to reach the Moon and fly above its surface. Using the Moon's gravitational force, it will propel into a unique distant retrograde orbit that will take it about 40,000 miles beyond the backside of the Moon. Orion will orbit the Moon and collect data to allow mission controllers to assess the performance of the spacecraft and its payloads.Preparing for SplashdownOrion will fly close to the Moon and use a precisely timed engine firing in conjunction with the Moon's gravity to accelerate back toward Earth – traveling at 25,000 mph as it enters the planet's atmosphere. The spacecraft will splash down off the coast of San Diego, California.""Most people today have not lived in a time when a human-rated deep space spacecraft has gone to the Moon or beyond,"" said Lisa Callahan, vice president and general manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin Space. ""With today's launch, that statistic has changed and we're now all members of the Artemis Generation. Personally, I can't wait to see the first woman walk on the Moon and the spacecraft that will take her there is already in development.""Story continuesLaunching a Series of Industry-First Demos and Advancements With a focus on leaning into commercial partnerships and building innovations that will prepare the industry for a future crewed mission, Lockheed Martin has several notables on board for the historic ride:Callisto: Lockheed Martin partnered with Amazon and Cisco to develop Callisto, a technology demonstration payload installed inside and interfacing with Orion during the Artemis I mission. Since Artemis I is uncrewed, Callisto was designed to test and demonstrate how commercial technology could be used to support future crewed missions in space. During the mission, controllers will operate the payload from the Johnson Space Center.LunIR CubeSat: One of 10 small satellites riding along with Artemis I, the Lockheed Martin-funded LunIR is a technology demonstration which will take images of the Moon to test the company's ultra-compact, novel infrared sensor that maps the Moon in both day and night. The team will apply learnings from this LunIR endeavor to future lunar and planetary scouting missions to support lower cost, applicable small satellites and technology demonstrations.AstroRad Vest: The Artemis I mission will also test AstroRad, a radiation-shielding vest developed by StemRad, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and the Israel Space Agency. The vest is made for space travel and is modeled after anti-radiation vests used by first responders on Earth. The MARE experiment put two torsos aboard the spacecraft – one wearing an AstroRad vest and one without to help determine exactly how much protection it will offer astronauts.Join the Artemis and Orion journeys by downloading the Explore Orion app to your mobile device and following @LMSpace on Twitter.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation, @LMSpace to learn more about the latest technologies, missions and people driving the future of space. Lockheed Martin Logo.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 5 Small-Cap Stocks. According to Royce Investment Partners, although equity prices declined in the volatile market environment through the first half of 2022, the third quarter saw a solid yet temporary rally. However, unlike their large-cap counterparts, small-cap stocks did not reach a record low in Q3 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index was down 2.2%, ahead of the large-cap Russell 1000 Index, which was down 4.6% over the same period. Similarly, while the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index dropped 8.4% in Q3 2022, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Large Cap Index plummeted 9.9%. While markets have plunged in response to skyrocketing inflation and interest rates, a steeper decline is yet to emerge, as per Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. The Federal Reserve has lifted rates by 3.75% over the last year. To avoid a “significant stagflation environment,” Dalio observed that the central bank would need to find a balance between inflation and interest rates. Ray Dalio believes that the United States is already facing a trade war, a technology war, a geopolitical war, and an economic war. He also sees a military war as a possibility in the near future. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). However, in this turbulent market backdrop, paired with the outperformance of small-cap stocks, it is a good idea to check out billionaire Ray Dalio’s top small-cap picks.

WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $6,638,000WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) was founded in 1953 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. The company develops and sells maintenance products, as well as homecare and cleaning products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the Asia Pacific. Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ray Dalio owns 37,771 shares of WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), worth $6.6 million and representing 0.03% of the total holdings. On October 19, WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $1.08, and a revenue of $130.42 million, up 13.2% on a year-over-year basis. For FY2023, WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) projects net sales growth of 5% to 10%, with net sales expected to fall between $545 million and $570 million.DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser on July 18 upgraded WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $205, up from $169. Given that she thinks the company should see double-digit pricing in FY23, the Street's sales growth estimate of 5%-7% ""looks conservative,"" noted the analyst, who also thinks the company should return to a 55% gross margin ""sometime in FY23.""According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 14 hedge funds were bullish on WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), compared to 15 funds in the prior quarter. Here is what Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Fund has to say about WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“WD-40 Company was a top contributor during the quarter. WD40’s primary product is the near-ubiquitous blue and yellow can of lubricant found in households around the world. WD-40 was one of the fortunate businesses that saw a substantial increase in demand for its product during the pandemic. The company is dubbing the phenomenon as ‘isolation renovation’ which reflects the increase in DIY and home improvement projects done while people were stuck at home. Not surprisingly, the company saw growth in the most recent quarter with outsized growth in its ecommerce channel. However, because the average DIY user only needs to replace the product every few years, we were concerned about a pull-forward in demand that might lead to slower growth going forward. We have exited our position to reinvest client capital in potential higher-return opportunities, as detailed below.”8. TreeHouse Foods, Inc.

(NYSE:EVH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $8,398,000Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) is a Virginia-based healthcare company that provides clinical and administrative solutions to patients and healthcare providers in the United States. Ray Dalio, as of Q3 2022, owns 158,369 shares of Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) worth $8.4 million, representing 0.03% of the total securities. On November 2, Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, beating market estimates by $0.49. The revenue of $352.6 million climbed 58.5% year-over-year, missing Wall Street consensus by $4.18 million. For Q4 2022, revenue is expected to be in the range of approximately $361 million to $381 million versus a consensus of $376.16 million.Piper Sandler analyst Jessica Tassan on November 4 maintained an Overweight rating on Evolent Health, Inc.

The company’s clinical and administrative solutions seek to help customers manage and administer patient care in a more cost-effective manner. Evolent Health targets mid-teen sales growth over the long-term, with a goal to reach mid-teens earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin by 2024.We believe Evolent’s strong second quarter stock performance is attributable to its positive first quarter 2022 earnings report, where Evolent exceeded many analysts’ expectations and raised its fiscal year 2022 outlook. Total lives, or individuals enrolled across all the platforms that Evolent offers, grew 74% year-over-year, driven by both the addition of new lives to the company’s platform and upselling to higher-priced offerings. Evolent also announced two new health plan or provider partnerships in the first quarter, bringing its year-to-date new partnerships to six. Evolent has historically targeted four to six new partnerships per year.We also believe Evolent shares outperformed relative to health care services peers in the current market environment because, unlike many names in its peer set, it is already profitable and generates positive free cash flow.”6.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +10.5% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has gained 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.27 indicates a change of +2.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $95.04 billion and $98.03 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Medtronic, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.085 = US$6.5b ÷ (US$90b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Therefore, Medtronic has an ROCE of 8.5%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for Medtronic roceIn the above chart we have measured Medtronic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Medtronic here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOver the past five years, Medtronic's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Medtronic to be a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Medtronic has been paying out a decent 45% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Medtronic isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 13% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.If you're still interested in Medtronic it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

162,e7dce0ad-e61a-3d0b-97af-3e49603e973a,MRK,2022-11-16,"Merck & Co., Inc.'s (NYSE:MRK) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-nyse-mrk-120116369.html,1668600076,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck's (NYSE:MRK) stock is up by 9.4% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Merck's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Merck How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:34% = US$15b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.34 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Merck's Earnings Growth And 34% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Merck has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 28% net income growth seen by Merck over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Merck's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 13% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Merck is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Merck Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Merck's significant three-year median payout ratio of 64% (where it is retaining only 36% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.Moreover, Merck is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Merck's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

With COVID-related deaths and cases down significantly, many countries are navigating how to transition from the public health emergency phase.The recommendations are a draft, NICE said, and until final guidance is published, access to COVID-19 medicines will continue as is. It did not say when final guidance would be published.NICE acknowledged that there is evidence that Merck's molnupiravir and Gilead Sciences Inc's hospital-administered antiviral remdesivir are effective at treating COVID-19.But it said it does not recommend their use at current prices because the cost-effectiveness estimates are higher than what it considers an acceptable use of the national health system's resources.It also recommended against three other COVID treatments, including GSK and partner Vir Biotechnology's sotrovimab, an antibody therapy that the World Health Organization recommended against in September.The other two are combination antibody treatments, Evusheld from AstraZeneca and Roche's Ronapreve.NICE did recommend three treatments for COVID in adults, Pfizer Inc's oral antiviral Paxlovid and two repurposed arthritis drugs, RoActemra from Roche and Olumiant, made by Eli Lilly and Co, subject to approval in the UK for treating COVID-19.One expert said that some of the COVID treatments NICE recommended against are an important part of the British government's current strategy.Story continues“Therapeutics are a major factor in the government’s “living” with COVID strategy as they provide a safety net for those unable to make beneficial responses to vaccines,"" said Stephen Griffin, associate professor at Leeds Institute of Medical Research.Ending use of these treatments would leave even more people vulnerable, he added.The cost-effectiveness review comes as countries and global agencies mull other changes to COVID healthcare.Last week, however, the Biden administration said the United States will keep in place the public health emergency status of the COVID pandemic there, allowing millions of Americans to still receive free tests, vaccines and treatments.

In the study, Lynparza plus J&amp;J’s Zytiga and prednisone or prednisolone reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 34% versus Zytiga alone. Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 24.8 months in the Lynparza plus Zytiga arm versus 16.6 months for Zytiga alone.AstraZeneca stock has risen 9.7% this year so far compared with an increase of 2.9% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA supplemental new drug application (sNDA) seeking approval of Lynparza with Zytiga and prednisone or prednisolone is under priority review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.At present, for prostate cancer, Lynparza is approved for BRCA-mutated mCRPC indication in several countries, including the United States and European Union, based on data from the PROfound phase III study.AstraZeneca markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck. The profit-sharing deal between AstraZeneca and Merck was inked in 2017. In addition to Lynparza, the deal included Koselugo.AstraZeneca &amp; Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indications as well as some other cancer types.Story continuesThe CHMP also recommended approving AstraZeneca and partner Daiichi Sankyo’s Enhertu for patients with previously treated HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer for patients who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen. The approval for this expanded use of Enhertu was based on data from the DESTINY-Gastric02 and the DESTINY-Gastric01 phase III studiesIn the United States, Enhertu was approved for advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric cancer in January 2021. In the United States, Enhertu is also approved for previously treated HER2-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers.In Europe, Enhertu is presently approved for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in patients who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens.The CHMP also recommended the approval of Imfinzi plus chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) based on the TOPAZ-1 phase III study. Updated survival data from the study showed that Imfinzi plus chemotherapy led to a 24% reduction in the risk of death versus chemotherapy alone. BTC is a group of rare and aggressive cancers that occur in the bile ducts and gallbladder.In the United States, Imfinzi plus chemotherapy was approved for treating locally advanced or metastatic BTC in September.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderAstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(MRK) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-mrk-attracting-140002673.html,1668520802,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +10.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has gained 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.38 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.6%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.16 billion and $58.3 billion estimates indicate +17.9% and -1.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG is permitted and expected to include two liquefaction trains and LNG storage tanks, as well as associated facilities capable of producing, under optimal conditions, up to approximately 13.5 Mtpa of LNG. Sempra Infrastructure recently announced it is expecting to take a final investment decision for Phase 1 of the liquefaction project in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the company announced last month that it had amended and restated its engineering, procurement and construction contract with Bechtel Energy for Phase 1. Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 is being developed as a similarly sized project located adjacent to the Phase 1 project.The Cameron LNG Phase 2 project is expected to include a single LNG train with a maximum production capacity of 6.75 Mtpa of LNG, as well as debottlenecking of the existing three LNG trains. The project is expected to include certain design enhancements resulting in a more cost-effective and efficient facility, while also reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions.The referenced HOA is a preliminary, non-binding arrangement, and the development of Sempra Infrastructure's LNG and associated pipeline projects remains subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including reaching definitive agreements, securing all necessary permits, signing engineering and construction contracts where applicable, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision for each project.About Sempra Infrastructure Sempra Infrastructure delivers energy for a better world.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Boeing’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Boeing Is Boeing Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Boeing is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $271.10, but it is currently trading at US$175 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Boeing’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Boeing generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In Boeing's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 60%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since BA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy BA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about Boeing as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into. Amid a volatile stock market environment, investors are turning towards insiders, billionaires, and famous money managers, in order to replicate their trades or get an idea about the near-term outlook based on their market moves. With Q3 earnings season coming to a close and several mega-cap stocks down meaningfully year-to-date, there is a chance for insiders to extend a vote of confidence by buying up their own company shares.Investors giving up on stocks because of recession fears amid an uncertain market backdrop may want to reconsider their actions, as insiders at prominent companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) are going on buying sprees. It is also a good idea to observe billionaire money managers like Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which controls a $20 billion stock portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. In an interview with Barron’s on November 11, Dalio explained his outlook on the economy in the following words: “When the next big downturn occurs, and the economic pain is greater than the inflation pain, you will see the Fed and other central banks continue money-printing to monetize debt. Then, real rates will go down again, money will become cheaper and more plentiful, and inflation-hedge assets and new innovation/technology-company equities will be most attractive.”Our Methodology We used Ray Dalio’s hedge fund Q3 2022 portfolio for this analysis, selecting his largest stock positions which have also had an insider purchase in the last 6 months. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling IntoStocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into10. Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is an American multinational corporation engaged in distributing food products, kitchen equipment, and tabletop items to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, and hospitality businesses.

On June 21, 2022, an insider also purchased 1,000 units of Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)’s common stock. Story continuesOn November 1, Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) reported its financial results for the quarter ending September 2022. The company posted a non-GAAP EPS of $0.97, falling short of market estimates by $0.02. The revenue of $19.13 billion climbed 15.9% on a year-over-year basis, beating Wall Street consensus by $430 million. Argus analyst John Staszak on November 2 raised the price target on Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) to $96 from $92 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

On September 15, two directors at the coffee giant purchased a total of 64,750 common shares priced at about $92.5 each. In Q3 2022, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) reported that comparable store sales increased 7% globally – gaining 11% in the United States and double digits internationally, excluding China. On November 4, Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer raised the price target on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) to $97 from $95 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares, telling investors that he is ""less worried"" about FY23 sales and earnings following the company's Q3 report.

D E Shaw held a prominent stake in the company, comprising 2.68 million shares worth $204.7 million. Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Same Store sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”8. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56CME Group Inc.

(NASDAQ:CME) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“CME Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares rose 4.6%, contributing to results as elevated market volatility and rising interest rates led to higher trading activity on CME’s exchanges. Average daily trading volume increased 19% year-over-year with notable strength in Interest Rates and Equities products. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, underpinned by its product breadth and liquidity depth, as well as its sustainable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures while also benefiting from the rising rate environment.”7. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 11.4 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $642.3 million and representing 3.25% of the total portfolio.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 400 million shares worth over $25 billion. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the re-franchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social media for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”6. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) provides healthcare services in the United States. The company operates general and acute care hospitals that offer medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, emergency services, and outpatient services.

It has a strong market presence in highly attractive geographies with growing populations and low unemployment, such as Texas and Florida, which leads to a favorable payor mix. We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Investment Companies in the WorldBiggest ESG Companies in the WorldBiggest LPG Shipping Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$66.72, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SouthernOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, for US$506k worth of shares, at about US$67.47 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$65.89. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year.

In total, Chief Information Officer &amp; Executive VP Martin Davis dumped US$201k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$166m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Southern Tell Us?An insider sold Southern shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Southern makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Southern (1 shouldn't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.Of course Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Skyworks Solutions' shares on or after the 21st of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.62 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.48 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Skyworks Solutions has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current stock price of $96.54. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Skyworks Solutions's payout ratio is modest, at just 29% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 41% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Skyworks Solutions's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Skyworks Solutions earnings per share are up 7.7% per annum over the last five years. Management have been reinvested more than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company has been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Skyworks Solutions has delivered 21% dividend growth per year on average over the past nine years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Skyworks Solutions? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Skyworks Solutions is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Skyworks Solutions is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. Skyworks Solutions looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Skyworks Solutions you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

(NYSE:NKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-nike-inc-120125285.html,1668600085,STORY,['NKE'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for NIKE Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.74bUS$5.63bUS$6.76bUS$7.45bUS$8.50bUS$9.27bUS$9.91bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.07%Est @ 6.94%Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$4.4kUS$4.9kUS$5.4kUS$5.6kUS$5.9kUS$6.0kUS$5.9kUS$5.8kUS$5.6kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$55bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$204bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$204b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$98bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$153b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$107, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.103. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For NIKE, there are three fundamental items you should explore:Financial Health: Does NKE have a healthy balance sheet?

Corporation's (NYSE:VFC) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.51 on 20th of December. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 6.1%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for V.F V.F's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, earnings were actually smaller than the dividend, and the company was actually spending more cash than it was making. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating free cash flows is a major warning sign for the sustainability of the dividend as these levels are certainly a bit high.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 60%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.historic-dividendV.F Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.72 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.04. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. V.F's earnings per share has shrunk at 16% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think V.F's payments are rock solid. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, V.F has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit concerning) we think you should know about.

192,503a4577-2352-3f8f-9538-16f5aadce90d,VFC,2022-11-16,"VF’s Latest Diversity Report Shows Progress in Organizational Integration, Not Just Numbers",WWD,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/503a4577-2352-3f8f-9538-16f5aadce90d/vf%E2%80%99s-latest-diversity-report.html,1668550797,STORY,['VFC'],"[Things appear to be steadily improving at VF Corp. when it comes to what the company calls inclusion, diversity, equity and action, or IDEA.In its latest annual IDEA report out this week, the company showed representation wins by both gender and ethnicity, as well as programs helping to improve the pipeline of people from more diverse backgrounds.More from WWDHubert de Givenchy's 1970s Black Cabine Models Made a Statement About DiversityInside the De Beers Dinner Celebrating Global Brand Ambassador Lupita Nyong'oA Look at the Costumes in Black Panther: Wakanda ForeverBut for Lauren Guthrie, VF’s vice president of global inclusion, diversity, equity and action, the wins went well beyond the numbers — and beyond her purview, too.“In my opinion, our work is best served when it’s not being executed by the inclusion, diversity, equity and action team at the ask, but where we can really spotlight the activation that is happening across the business,” she told WWD.Still, because the numbers are often what people want to understand first, the report showed that representation of women-identifying people across the organization for fiscal-year 2022 is more than half at 53.2 percent (albeit down from 54.5 percent in the previous year). At the director level and above, representation of women ticked up from 40.7 percent to 41.8 percent.When it comes to progress toward those increases over the last year, VF said 56.1 percent of its new hires at the corporate headquarters level were women and that 60.4 percent of promotions were earned by women. On the attrition side, which not all companies are transparent about, 63.6 percent of those who left VF at the corporate level were women.Racially, 39.5 percent of those working across all levels of VF identify as white, 33.5 percent as Latine, 8.7 percent as Black, 7 percent as two or more races, 5.7 percent as Asian and just slightly more than 1 percent identifying as Native.In terms of those identifying as Black, Indigenous or people of color, the number went from 16.4 percent at the director level and above last fiscal year, to 18.1 percent in the 2022 fiscal year. New hires at the corporate level among people from diverse backgrounds were 31.5 percent of the total hires, promotions earned were 20.2 percent and attrition stood at 37.4 percent.Story continuesAsked what the company is doing to improve representation where it lacks it the most — particularly among Black, Asian and Native employees — Guthrie said the company is working to “get underneath the covers and understand the dimensions around each one of our populations because in some cases there are unique needs, necessary to support their growth and development.”As such, VF is working with specific organizations, including nonprofit Black Equity at Work, to build out specific plans to improve representation among specific groups as well as to “create ascension paths into our corporate brand environments,” according to Guthrie.And to hold itself to task — and keep its employees up to speed on where things are, another key aspect of transparency — the company shares representation data quarterly on new hire, promotion, attrition and job change rates at an individual race and ethnicity level.One thing Guthrie is proudest of in this year’s report is evidence, as she noted, of a greater integration of efforts around DE&amp;I across the organization.VF’s collaboration with the Pensole Design Academy and founder D’Wayne Edwards, which established a “DiverCity x Design” apprenticeship program, bringing in a cohort of five rising designers who had three-month rotations across VF brands, including The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Altra, has been particularly fruitful.It’s, as Guthrie said, “an incredible example of how we’re thinking about connecting our internal opportunities with external needs at a societal level. And D’Wayne has been a tremendous partner in really helping us understand the magnitude of deficit when it comes to cultural, racial and ethnic diversity.”What’s not in this latest report, according to Guthrie, is that the company hired four out of five of those individuals for full-time roles across the organization, and the fifth, she said, “we’re hoping to snag at some point in time but it was important for him to finish his undergraduate degree and we were hugely supportive of that.”In other areas, VF said it’s also seeing progress. While it had committed to allocating 10 percent of its U.S. grant funding through the VF Foundation to DE&amp;I efforts, that number has actually reached 56 percent.“Part of the reason for that is the recognition that equity can be a key filter and all of our giving priorities,” Guthrie said, “so not just kind of segregated to that 10 percent goal.”One area where Guthrie said VF could still use some work, and is among the company’s key efforts between now and next year’s IDEA report, is internal belonging.“As we continue to build in our maturity journey, we have to continuously come back to the basics and the most foundational elements of our strategy which, ultimately, is this commitment to belonging for our associates…there is no authenticity in those external engagements without rigorous focus on our internal associate experience,” Guthrie said. “So we’ve continued to really invest in listening, both through surveys and focus groups, to ensure that we’re in lockstep with our associate communities, and where there’s dissonance in the system, that were really diligent about exploring it and navigating it.”]"

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Pfizer's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Pfizer How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:32% = US$30b ÷ US$93b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Pfizer's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Pfizer has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 19% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Pfizer was able to see a decent net income growth of 8.6% over the last five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Pfizer's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Pfizer's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Pfizer Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Pfizer has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 73%, meaning that it is left with only 27% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Besides, Pfizer has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 42% over the next three years. However, Pfizer's future ROE is expected to decline to 16% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Pfizer certainly does have some positive factors to consider. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

The study achieved its primary endpoint of generating a superior antibody response in study participants compared with the booster dose of Spikevax. The bivalent vaccines also met non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria to the original strain.The bivalent vaccine contains an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron variants. While mRNA-1273.222 contains the spike protein in the BA.4/5 Omicron subvariants, mRNA-1273.214 contains the spike protein in the BA.1 Omicron subvariant.An exploratory data analysis also revealed that both the bivalent vaccines demonstrated robust neutralizing activity against BQ.1.1, an emerging COVID-19 variant. The result from this analysis confirmed that the bivalent vaccines are effective against new and evolving variants. However, the neutralizing activity of these vaccines against the BQ.1.1 variant dropped 5-fold in titers compared with the BA.4/5 variants.Shares of Moderna have declined 29.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s 19.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement also stated that the frequency of adverse events observed in patients administered the bivalent vaccines was less than compared with participants who had received the second or third dose of Spikevax.This August, the FDA granted EUA to Moderna and Pfizer PFE/BioNTech’s BNTX Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines for a single booster dose. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna booster vaccines can be given at least two months following primary or booster vaccination.While Moderna’s Omicron booster is authorized for adults aged 18 years and older, Pfizer/BioNTech’s version is approved for people 12 and older.Story continuesThe EUA was expanded last month to include children as young as five years. Following the EUA expansion, a 10-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for individuals aged between five and 11 years. A 25-µg and 50-µg dose of Moderna’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, respectively.The above FDA authorizations granted to Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are based on clinical studies on their bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccines and pre-clinical data from studies on their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike all previously-approved COVID-19 vaccines, the authorization granted to these booster shots is not supported by data from any human clinical studies demonstrating the vaccine’s effectiveness. Encouraging data reported by these companies will help them support their regulatory filings for these vaccines across different countries.Moderna, Inc. PriceModerna, Inc.

Its COVID-19 vaccine together with the oral antiviral pill for COVID-19, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022. Pfizer boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth.Nevertheless, according to the Zacks analyst estimate Pfizer’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 30% over the next three years.

Also, legal hassles and higher dependence on overseas revenues are woes.However, Goldman Sachs has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other one. The company continues to expand organically and bolster its digital consumer banking platform.Other than business diversification, robust client engagement, a solid position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), and a decent investment banking (IB) backlog are likely to aid in navigating weaker markets.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the broadcasting industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Broadcasting Companies in the World.The broadcasting industry has seen a paradigm shift in its dynamics after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of radio, newspapers, and televisions are now fading away in the past as digital streaming and digital broadcasting networks have experienced a sharp rise in consumption of late, with the likes of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime on the rise. According to research by Zenith, people spend more time than ever before viewing media, consuming about eight hours of media each day.Commercial broadcasting in the United States stretches back to the 1920s, when news bulletins, music programs, and live sporting events were first broadcasted into people's homes. Since then, the industry has continued to grow, and the U.S television industry alone stood at a market value of $210.4 billion in 2021, rising by $12.3 billion from 2020. Comcast Corporation and Fox Corporation remain two of the biggest broadcasting networks in the United States.However, it is interesting to note that although the sector keeps growing explosively in terms of its market size, the number of people employed in the US broadcasting sector has continued to fall in the past two decades. This is largely due to the rise of digital streaming platforms that require a substantially smaller number of people to operate as compared to radio or television.Digital platforms provide curated content to users as per their tastes and profiles. The overall experience is interactive and personalized for the user, which is what traditional media often lacks. Some examples of digital broadcasting companies include YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. The rise in traffic to digital streaming platforms has encouraged digital media companies to invest heavily in producing digital content. In 2020, Netflix invested $17 billion in content creation, up from $15.3 billion in 2019. The revenue for the digital streaming app industry is forecasted to reach $115 billion by 2026, from $72.2 billion in 2021.Story continuesPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization. In addition to TV, radio and telecommunications companies, we have also included major streaming companies in this list as they are taking the form of mainstream broadcasters as streaming replaces TV in households worldwide.15. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE)Market Cap: $1.51 billionParamount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) is a global media and entertainment corporation that develops content for viewers worldwide. The corporation has the industry's most important and vast libraries of TV and film titles. Its portfolio includes some of the top media networks, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Colors, VH1, and many more. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) also owns Simon &amp; Schuster, VidCon, and Bellator. The company was previously named ViacomCBS Inc. and renamed itself Paramount Global in February 2022.Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) revenue for 2021 was reported at $702.7 million, a 1% increase from the previous year's $695.9 million.In addition to Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are included in our list of 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world.14. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS)Market Cap: $2.87 billionAltice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) is a French multinational mass media and telecommunication company. Altice USA, Inc. has spread its operation in four regions – Western Europe, Israel, the United States, and Overseas Territories. The company has become the second-largest telecommunication company in France. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) has over 50 million TV, phone, and internet corporate and residential customers. In 2017, the company expanded its online advertising business by acquiring Teads.The company's revenue for 2021 stood at $10.09 billion, recording an increase of 1.98% from $9.89 billion in 2020.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, MPE Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Two (very) costly mistakes I've made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) and Poshmark. Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality, I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up the case that we pay over intrinsic value, at worst case we should never lose money on an investment. I will dive into one of these mistakes below and maybe dive into the other in a future letter. My thinking when buying Altice USA was that they operate as a duopoly in their main footprint, the New York Tri-State area. They provide a needs-based service: internet, video, and voice services. I figured this is a very stable business with high barriers to entry. Management seemed competent as well based on historical capital allocation decisions. I didn't fully appreciate at the time how poorly positioned they were relative to Verizon Fios, as well as how fiercely competitive the business can get on promotions and customer acquisition.Altice offers hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) while Fios offers fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). FTTH is a far superior product, which has led to some share loss to Fios in the parts of their footprint that overlap. There have also been some subscriber losses in their other footprint due to new cable entrants and fixed wireless offerings (…read more)13. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS)Market Cap: $3.09 billionZee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS) is an Indian company active in the content and broadcasting segments.

DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH)Market Cap: $7.50 billionDISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) was established in 1996 in the United States. The company has two main business subdivisions: Pay-Tv and Wireless. Pay-Tv subdivision offers its services under the DISH and the SLING brand. Pay-Tv has licenses to use Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) and Fixed Satellite Service (FSS), which offer video services to broadcasting networks and offers over-the-top (OTT) content. Wireless offers its customers postpaid and prepaid wireless services. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) invested approximately $20 billion into its Wireless 5G sector to acquire wireless spectrum licenses, including the 3.45-3.55 GHz band licenses.DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) revenue for 2021 stood at $17.88 billion, a 15.4% YoY increase from $15.49 billion in 2020.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Portfolio holdings in the communication services and financial sectors also made strong contributions. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS's cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish's long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration's infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.11. Vivendi SE (EPA:VIV)Market Cap: €9.24 billionVivendi SE (EPA:VIV) is mass media holding company founded in December 1987 and is headquartered in Paris, France.

The decline was primarily driven by a softening in investor sentiment towards News Corp's Digital Real Estate assets against a backdrop of rising interest rates in both Australia and the U.S., with REA Group shares down 17% during the quarter. While concerns over property market drivers are likely to continue in the near term, we see both REA Group and Move as being well positioned to structurally improve their businesses through this period.

While using a credit card when traveling has several advantages, chief among them the protections the card affords, not everyone has one or wants to travel with one.Have Any $200 Quarters Lying Around? It’s Worth Checking Your Spare ChangeAdvice: If Your Credit Score is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowIt’s true that the payment method remains very popular, as a new GOBankingRates survey finds that 38% of Americans have charged travel expenses to their credit cards — the second most popular use following monthly bills. But, on the other hand, 16% say they don’t own credit cards.Other reasons for not using a credit card while traveling include wanting to manage expenses in a more sensible way, wanting to avoid fees or simply waiting to be approved for one.So no credit card? No problem. There are still plenty of options if you fall into this category and are traveling. Let’s take a look at some of them.Debit CardYou can use a debit card when traveling, the same way you use a credit card for airline or hotel bookings, for example. It has multiple advantages, namely that you can use only the funds that are linked to your bank account, and hence you can’t overspend.However, be aware that hotels or airlines may place a hold on the debit card until your travel date.“Debit cards have the benefit of not putting you in debt when used,” said Jason Porter, senior investment manager at Scottish Heritage SG. “They restrict your spending to the funds in your bank account.”Porter adds that there also won’t be any monthly interest fees; however, if you reserve a hotel room or hire a car using a debit card, the hotel or car rental firm can put a higher hold on your card than the reservation amount as insurance against mishaps.“The card will be refused if you run out of money, though, unless you enroll in an overdraft protection program, in which case the bank would cover the expense,” Porter said. “If you don’t, and you face an unforeseen expense, you might not have sufficient funds in your account to make a transaction at that point.”Story continuesTake Our Poll: What’s the First Thing You Would Do If You Won a Big Lottery Jackpot?PayPalAnother option to pay for your travel expenses is to open a PayPal account; linking your bank accounts, debit cards or credit cards will let you book flights, car rental and hotel reservations. PayPal also has several business partners — Hotwire, Hotels.com, Expedia and Orbitz, as well as numerous airlines.Rhett Stubbendeck, CEO of LeverageRx, said he mostly uses PayPal for traveling as it is a secure way to pay and you don’t have to enter credit and debit card information with the airline or hotel.He notes, however, that using this payment method can cause some inconvenience.“PayPal sometimes freezes the user’s account without any warning,” he said. “Any unusual behavior is identified by the company’s algorithms, which makes it impossible to receive or send money. Furthermore, PayPal can sometimes put a hold on your money.”Gift CardsGift cards are a great option too as they run the travel world gamut. In addition to airlines, gift cards are used by Airbnb, Hotels.com, Uber, Amtrak and several cruise lines. Delta’s gift cards range from $50 to $2,000, while Airbnb’s gift cards range from $25 to $2,000.“Gift cards can be obtained in various ways, and often at a discount, so you’re actually spending less on travel expenses, which makes it a great way to save a little money,” said Pamela Howard at Our Adventure is Everywhere. “Some of the disadvantages are that you have to purchase the gift cards ahead of time and carry them around — and it’s frustrating when there is just a little bit of money left on them. However, the ability to not worry about carrying credit cards and the savings from purchasing the gift cards at a discount can outweigh those inconveniences.”CashCash is the easiest way to go, but it also can be less safe, as you won’t have any resort if you lose it or if it’s stolen. However, if you want to budget better, that might be the way to go. Another important point is that you can’t pay for airline tickets online in cash obviously, but some airlines let you do so at the airport.“There’s a psychological effect to using cash,” said Trevor Ford, head of growth at mobile app Yotta. “You instinctively want to stretch those dollars as much as you can. You don’t have the same mindset whenever you use plastic.”Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)BNPL is a type of deferred payment option that generally allows the consumer to split a purchase into smaller installments, typically four or less, often with a down payment of 25% due at checkout, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). If you’re in a pinch or want to spread out the expenses, this form of payment might be a good option.“Paying over time with an option like Affirm provides consumers with the flexibility to spread out costs and transparency to better control their budgets,” said Ashmi Pancholi, VP of consumer insights at Affirm. “As many navigate record-high travel prices, we’ve seen the demand for alternative payment options firsthand at Affirm. This past summer, we saw 5X greater spend on flights while hotel spend more than doubled.”Pancholi added that Affirm has several partners in the travel space, including American Airlines, Delta Vacations, Vrbo, Vacasa and Priceline.However, BNPL payments are loans and, as such, must be used with caution.“One of the biggest challenges of these plans is paying on the due date,” said Freddie Huynh, vice president of data optimization with Freedom Debt Relief. “It sounds simple, but it’s one more payment to manage, along with rent or mortgage, utilities and any other debt payments. Not all payments have the same due date, and compounding that is the every-two-weeks due date for most BNPL plans. And, if you do not make a payment on time and in full, the interest and fees can be substantial.”More From GOBankingRatesStimulus Checks: See If Your State Is Mailing Out Payments in NovemberGOBankingRates' Best Credit Cards for 2023If Your Credit Score is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowBest Business Credit CardsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Experts: How To Pay for Travel Expenses Without a Credit Card]"

It intends to enable enterprises to address complex business process challenges at scale across domains and industries. This, in turn, will help optimize enterprise cost structure and improve productivity and user experiences.The center will allow both Infosys and IBM clients to analyze workflows, design AI-infused apps with low-code tooling, assign tasks to bots, and track performance on the go. Further, they will get hands-on access to various digital solutions across the data, AI, and hyper-automation spaces. Some of those solutions are Infosys Intelligent Document Processing, Infosys Interaction Analytics, Infosys Multilingual Conversational AI, Infosys Accounts Payable on Cloud, Infosys Cortex, Infosys Material Master Harmonization, and Infosys Data Workbench from Infosys BPM.Infosys Limited Price and ConsensusInfosys Limited Price and ConsensusInfosys Limited price-consensus-chart | Infosys Limited QuoteThe portfolio will also include IBM CloudPak for Data, IBM Watson Assistant &amp; IBM Watson Discovery, IBM SaferPayments, IBM Blockchain, IBM Sterling Supply Chain, IBM Risk and Fraud Detection software, and Envizi for Sustainability. Infosys BPM’s Center of AI and Automation, which emphasizes a two-year agreement with IBM, is launched to commemorate the subsidiary firm’s 15th anniversary.Infosys has been reinforcing its digital-transformation capabilities to expand and solidify its position in the highly competitive environment. It enables its clients across more than 45 countries to create and execute strategies for their digital transformation. Such efforts in the digital-transformation business will aid the company in competing with peers like Accenture and Cognizant.Story continuesIn September, Infosys collaborated with Bpost (Belgium Post), a postal operator and e-commerce logistics provider headquartered in Brussels, to provide cloud security solutions that will identify and ensure rapid response to suspicious security events.In the same month, Infosys collaborated with Spirit AeroSystems, Inc., one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aerostructures for commercial airplanes, defense platforms, and business/regional jets. Per the five-year contract, the IT company intends to offer end-to-end aerostructure and systems engineering services for product development of commercial, business jet and emerging aircraft programs.Back-to-back contract wins are driving Infosys’ top-line performance. In the last reported financial results for second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s revenues jumped 13.9% year over year to $4.56 billion.Nonetheless, Infosys’ near-term growth prospects are likely to be hurt as organizations are postponing their plans of investing in big and expensive technology products on growing global slowdown concerns amid the current macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Moreover, elevated operating expenses related to hiring new employees and sales and marketing strategies to capture more market share are likely to strain margins in the near term.These, along with the rapid proliferation of customizable Internet-based software, have been hampering Infosys’ traditional outsourcing business. These challenges might weigh on the company’s profitability going ahead.Shares of INFY have dropped 18.6% while IBM jumped 21.8% in the past year.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderInfosys and IBM currently hold Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Computer and Technology sector are Celestica CLS and Fabrinet FN.

By combining GM's extensive fuel cell expertise and Nel's deep knowledge of electrolyzers, the two companies are looking to enable more cost competitive sources of renewable hydrogen.""General Motors is one of the global leaders in hydrogen fuel cell propulsion with more than 50 years of experience. We believe this collaboration will give us a competitive advantage in industrializing the production of our PEM electrolyzers and further improving the efficiency of our technology,"" said Nel's CEO, Håkon Volldal.""Adding Nel as a strategic collaborator is an important step to help us commercialize fuel cell technology. Electrolysis is key to creating consistent, clean sources of hydrogen to power fuel cells,"" said Charles Freese, GM executive director, Global HYDROTEC. ""Nel has some of the most promising electrolyzer technology to help develop clean hydrogen infrastructure, and we believe our HYDROTEC fuel cell IP can help them get closer to scale.""Nel was the first company in the world with a fully automated alkaline electrolyzer production line. The next step will be to industrialize the production of its PEM electrolyzer equipment in a similar way which will enable considerable technology advancement.GM is developing and commercializing both HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell and Ultium battery technologies that deliver where it matters most: performance and cost. This is opening new revenue potential for GM as industries – including freight trucking, aerospace, power generation and locomotive – turn to GM to improve performance and reduce emissions.""An automated production concept is key when scaling up and driving down cost on electrolyzer technology. By utilizing the combined expertise of both companies, it will help to more quickly develop a green hydrogen technology that is competitive with fossil fuels,"" said Volldal.Story continuesA PEM electrolyzer and a fuel cell are largely based on the same principles. A PEM electrolyzer uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen and oxygen, while a fuel cell reverses the process, using hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. As GM has made major steps and gained expertise with fuel cells, the two companies see substantial synergies by transferring this to Nel's PEM platform.Nel will be compensating GM for the development work and IP transfer on an ongoing basis and pay a license after successful commercialization dependent on how much of the end product is based on GM technology.About Nel ASA | www.nelhydrogen.comNel is a global, dedicated hydrogen company, delivering optimal solutions to produce, store and distribute hydrogen from renewable energy.

NEXT is a Houston-based company developing the biorefinery which, at full production, could produce up to 50,000 barrels per day of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), renewable diesel, and other renewable fuels. UAV could invest as much as $37.5 million into NEXT, as long as the company meets certain milestone targets.""Right now, one of the biggest barriers to increasing supply and lowering costs of sustainable fuel is that we don't have the infrastructure in place to transport it efficiently, but NEXT's strategic location and assets solve that problem and provide a blueprint for future facilities that need to be built,"" said Michael Leskinen, President of United Airline Ventures. ""We believe this investment will not only bolster NEXT's ambitions and create near-term solutions to expand our SAF supply, but further demonstrates our commitment toward producing SAF at the scale necessary to decarbonize the aviation industry.""NEXT's biorefinery offers several unique benefits including access to a deep-water port, an existing industrial-grade dock, and multi-modal logistics options, which facilitates access to feedstock options and fast-growth SAF offtake markets on the west coast. NEXT has secured an agreement with BP for sourcing 100 percent of its feedstock, further de-risking supply issues smaller facilities have historically experienced. NEXT has also received a crucial air permit from the State of Oregon. Once all the necessary approvals and permits are obtained and the biorefinery is operational, it has the potential to be used as a platform to scale SAF and deploy additional future technologies.Story continues""The clean fuels industry is taking off and our access to feedstocks, multi-modal distribution, and major industry players positions us to be a leading SAF supplier on the West Coast,"" said Christopher Efird, CEO and Chairperson of NEXT. ""United's investment in NEXT strengthens our resolve to be one of the clean fuels leaders in the transportation sector.""Today's announcement marks UAV's fifth SAF-related technology investment, and its first investment directly in a biorefinery. United has been an industry leader in advocating for alternative jet fuel for years – including investing in more SAF production than any other airline in the world and flying the world's first passenger flight using 100% SAF in one engine. United also launched the Eco-Skies Alliance program, which among its 30 corporate participants, has collectively purchased more than 7 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel.Launched in 2021, UAV is a first-of-its-kind sustainability-focused ventures fund that targets startups, upcoming technologies, and concepts that will complement United's goal of net zero emissions by 2050 – without relying on traditional carbon offsets such as voluntary offsets or planting trees. To date, UAV's portfolio includes SAF producers and other companies advancing technologies including carbon utilization, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

We are a consumption-based economy, so you never want to see that,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.Bucking the trend, home improvement retailer Lowe's Companies Inc jumped 2.4% after increasing its annual profit forecast on steady demand.""It's a mixed picture, but at the same time, you get the idea that things are in the process of slowing. It will lower expectations for other retailers,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief economist of Hugh Johnson Economics in Albany, New York.The earnings reports come on the heels of upbeat quarterly results from Walmart Inc on Tuesday that had added to market optimism driven by a softer-than-expected producer prices report.All the three main indexes ended higher on Tuesday on hopes that the improved inflation outlook would allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to take a less aggressive approach on interest rate hikes, though geopolitical worries kept investors on edge.A missile that hit Poland was probably a stray fired by Ukraine's air defenses and not a Russian strike, Poland and NATO said on Wednesday, easing global concern that the conflict in Ukraine could spill across the border.Story continuesKey retail sales figures due at 8:30 a.m. ET will be parsed for further clues on the impact to consumers' purchasing power from soaring prices.

The company lowered its fourth-quarter expectations as a result, causing its shares to fall by nearly 14 percent at the start of Wednesday’s session.More from WWDPhotos of Target's 2021 Designer Dress CollectionWalmart and Target figure out how to fight back at AmazonTarget 20th Anniversary Collection: See All the Photos“In the latter weeks of the quarter, sales and profit trends softened meaningfully, with guests’ shopping behavior increasingly impacted by inflation, rising interest rates and economic uncertainty,” Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive officer of Target Corp., said in a statement. “This resulted in a third-quarter profit performance well below our expectations.“While we’re ready to deliver exceptional value for our guests this holiday season, supported by the decisive inventory actions we took earlier this year, the rapidly evolving consumer environment means we’re planning the balance of the year more conservatively,” Cornell continued. “We’re also taking new actions to drive efficiencies now and in the future, optimizing our operations to match the scale of our business and drive continued growth. The strides we have made in recent years to build a truly differentiated, guest-centered retail offering, punctuated by a balanced, multicategory portfolio, positions us well to navigate in any environment. Looking ahead, we remain laser-focused on delivering the best of Target to our guests and continuing to invest in our long-term, profitable growth.”The company logged $712 million in profits during the three-month period ending Oct. 29, compared with $1.48 billion last year. That’s on the heels of last quarter’s results, where Target’s profits fell by nearly 90 percent thanks to rapidly changing consumer preferences, which left the retailer with a glut of excess inventory.Story continuesIn the most recent quarter, top-line results were slightly more favorable with $26.5 billion in total revenues, compared with $25.6 billion a year ago. Still, analysts were expecting closer to $26.38 billion in revenues.A few bright spots during the quarter included comparable sales growth, which was up 2.7 percent, year-over-year, driven by a 1.4 percent increase in traffic and 1.3 percent increase in average ticket price, year-over-year. Comparable digital sales were up 0.3 percent during the quarter.Beauty, food and beverage and household essentials continued to be growth drivers, helping offset softness in discretionary items.Gross margin rate for the quarter was 24.7 percent, compared with 28 percent last year, driven by higher markdown rates, inventory shrinkage, merchandise and freight costs, increased employee compensation costs and the cost of managing early inventory receipts. The company said a more favorable category mix and higher prices helped offset some of the pressure.Target is now anticipating low-single-digit declines in comparable sales during the holiday shopping season, with an operating margin rate centered around 3 percent.The firm also said it plans to save between $2 billion and $3 billion in the next three years by being more efficient, although it did not say how.“The company announced today it was undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to simplify and gain efficiencies across its business with a focus on reducing complexities and lowering costs while continuing to support its team. These savings will support the company’s investments in driving deeper guest engagement and long-term growth while also delivering on its profit goals. This opportunity is enabled by the rapid growth since 2019, in which Target’s total revenue has grown approximately 40 percent. In light of this growth, this effort is focused on fully leveraging the scale that’s been gained to best-position the company to continue growing efficiently over time.”Target ended the quarter with $954 million in cash and cash equivalents and $14.2 billion in long-term debt. The retailer has nearly 2,000 stores around the U.S.Target’s quarterly earnings reveal comes just one day after Walmart revealed losses in the last three months, despite its top-line performance that caused the world’s largest retailer to raise guidance for the year. Also similar to Walmart, Target has been on a multi-year journey to establish itself as a fashion destination.In September, Target launched its 18th owned apparel brand called “Future Collective.” Ten of its owned brands are billion-dollar brands, including women’s activewear brand All in Motion. The retailer also revealed the latest design partners that same month and said it would hire roughly 100,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, the same number as last year.Shares of Target, which closed up 3.95 percent Tuesday to $178.98, are down nearly 33 percent, year-over-year.]"

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.3%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. Check out our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, prior to this announcement, CSX's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 16.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.6% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that CSX has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.CSX Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

ROST, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Ross Stores is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ROST in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 83 cents per share for ROST, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ROST, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3.13% heading into earnings season.Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRoss Stores, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ross Stores, Inc.

233,df9fa6ef-6cab-31b6-8020-156de91bcd69,ROST,2022-11-16,Dollar Tree (DLTR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-tree-dltr-earnings-expected-150003095.html,1668524403,STORY,"['DLTR', 'ROST']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Dollar Tree (DLTR) reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 22. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.8%.Revenues are expected to be $6.84 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dollar Tree?For Dollar Tree, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.57%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Dollar Tree will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dollar Tree would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of +1.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Dollar Tree appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerRoss Stores (ROST), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.80 for the quarter ended October 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -26.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.36 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Ross Stores has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

Indeed, the broader market and economic dynamics encourage retail investors to think about value and stability over growth.Earlier, I laid out the monetary backdrop that should guide investing principles in the new normal. “In the trailing five years since September 2022, the real M2 money stock expanded over 30%. Put another way, money was “cheap” (or inflationary), so it incentivized business growth. However, in the trailing year, M2 declined over 5%, making money “expensive” (deflationary).”Put another way, companies with deeply established track records should gain significant relevance. You couldn’t ask for a better framework for no-brainer blue-chip stocks to buy. Below are some compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAAPLApple$149.70MSFTMicrosoft$247.11ABTAbbott Laboratories$104.09VEEVVeeva Systems$191.02ROSTRoss Stores$96.17CTSHCognizant Technology$58.42BF-BBrown-Forman$69.64Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Cupertino, California, consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) really needs no introduction. Recently, the company generated buzz when its market performance for the Nov. 10 session added $190.9 billion in market value, a record for a U.S.-listed company. At the time of writing, Apple had a market capitalization of $2.38 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company.To be fair, broadly weak consumer sentiment data suggests that companies like Apple should be having a rough time. Not surprisingly, AAPL is down over 19% on a year-to-date basis. However, the fundamentals remain strong. For instance, the company benefited from strong results from its latest product rollout. Therefore, Apple facilitates a powerful case for no-brainer blue-chip stocks to buy.Story continuesFinancially, AAPL brings excellent value for what you get. The company enjoys blistering performance states for growth and profitability. In addition, Apple provides stability in the balance sheet, particularly its Altman Z-Score of 6.45 reflecting low bankruptcy risk.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a software and technology powerhouse. In addition, the company also carved a huge name for itself as a console video game manufacturer. Therefore, the company enjoys a wide canvas of relevancies. At the moment, MSFT features a market cap of $1.84 trillion, making it one of the elites among blue-chip stocks to buy.Fundamentally, what investors should focus on regarding MSFT is that the underlying company dominates the business ecosystem. For example, it owns 76% of the desktop operating system market share. In other words, if you want to get anything done in the professional realm, you have to be familiar with Microsoft Windows and its business applications.Financially, Gurufocus.com considers MSFT a modestly undervalued investment based on its proprietary calculations. It’s difficult to argue with this notion. Microsoft enjoys strong revenue growth metrics along with excellent profitability margins that dominate the underlying sector. Additionally, it features a stable balance sheet based on its 7.36 Altman Z-Score.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a multinational medical device and health care company. Currently, Abbott sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines, and nutritional products. At the time of writing, the enterprise commands a market cap of nearly $181.4 billion. Since the start of the year, ABT dropped 25% in equity value.To be sure, Abbott carries much baggage. From its baby formula recall to weak medical device sales, the company can’t say it doesn’t deserve any market loss. At the same time, near-term momentum has been picking up. In the trailing five days since the close of the Nov. 10 session, ABT gained 6.5% in value.Against the bigger picture financially, ABT certainly makes a strong case for blue-chip stocks to buy. Mainly, the company enjoys excellent profit margins. For example, its net margin stands at 17.5%, beating out 82% of the competition. Also, its return on equity (ROE) is 22% compared to the industry median of 0.2%.Veeva Systems (VEEV)an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stockSource: Blackboard / ShutterstockFounded in 2007, Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) operates out of Pleasanton, California. Veeva is a cloud-computing company focused on pharmaceutical and life sciences industry applications. At the moment, the enterprise features a market cap of $29.66 billion. Since the beginning of this year, VEEV gave up nearly 27% of its equity value. However, shares are making a comeback, gaining nearly 16% over the trailing month.Admittedly, the fallout in the market this year has not been kind, especially toward the tech segment. However, with recent data on inflation coming in lighter than expected, it’s possible that the Federal Reserve could relax its monetary tightening policy. If so, that might encourage badly beaten-up investors to consider tech plays like VEEV.Now, what makes Veeva one of the blue-chip stocks to buy centers on its financial resilience. Primarily, the company enjoys a stout balance sheet. For instance, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 46 times, ranked better than 87% of its rivals. Also, the enterprise carries outstanding profit margins that also rank among the sector’s elite.Ross Stores (ROST)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dublin, California, Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) is a chain of discount department stores. Per its public profile, the company is the largest off-price retailer in the U.S. Presently, Ross Stores carries a market cap of $33.38 billion. Since the start of the year, ROST slipped more than 14%. Still, the stock is outperforming the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Obviously, the big concern for ROST that works against its inclusion among the blue-chip stocks to buy centers on sentiment. With the consumer taking a beating from high inflation and now rising layoffs, not too many folks are interested in opening their wallets unnecessarily. However, with remote work facing a possible paradigm shift as employees lose leverage to employers, many folks might be forced to upgrade their professional wardrobes.Cynically, that’s a big plus for Ross Stores. While it’s a tricky narrative, it’s still worth considering for blue-chip stocks to buy. On a final note, the company impresses on the income statement, particularly its strong operating and net margins.Cognizant Technology (CTSH)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockBased in New Jersey, Cognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH) is an American multinational information technology services and consulting company. Cognizant provides myriad solutions, including business process services, cloud-computing applications, industrial automation, and artificial intelligence. At the time of writing, Cognizant carries a market cap of $30 billion.Since the January opener, CTSH stock gave up 36% of its equity value. As with other tech-related blue-chip stocks to buy, macroeconomic headwinds imposed a dark cloud over the broader industry. Nevertheless, enthusiasm is finally returning to the space, with CTSH gaining nearly 9% over the trailing five days. While it still has a ways to go, this might be the start of something interesting.Financially, CTSH will likely attract investors seeking blue-chip stocks to buy because it’s deeply undervalued. Shares trade at 12.2 times forward earnings, comparing favorably to the industry median of 22.2 times. Also, the company features a stable balance sheet with an Altman Z-Score of over 6, reflecting low bankruptcy risk.Brown-Forman (BF-B)Glasses of red, pink and white wine sitting on a wooden railing.Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-B) is one of the largest companies in the spirits and wine industry. It features some iconic brands including Jack Daniel’s, Old Forester, and Woodford Reserve. At the time of writing, Brown-Forman commands a market cap of $33.48 billion. Since the start of the year, BF.B declined by 2.4% in the charts.Interestingly, though, over the trailing month, BF.B gained 8%. At least some of this enthusiasm might be traced to the underlying fundamentals. According to TipRanks, “during a recession, consumers are likely to increase alcohol consumption at home, while companies in the space retain fantastic pricing power during such periods.” Further, with people likely to seek escapism from troubling headlines, Brown-Forman could jump higher on cynical catalysts.Financially, what may impress market observers the most is the company’s high business quality. It features an ROE of 32.7%, beating out more than 90% of its competitors. Also, it has a return on assets of 13.9%, above more than 86% of the industry.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

235,90e7139d-f78c-3272-99be-63b9e0644492,ADI,2022-11-16,Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) five-year earnings growth trails the strong shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-nasdaq-adi-five-130048802.html,1668603648,STORY,['ADI'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) shareholders have enjoyed a 83% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 46% (not including dividends).On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Analog Devices managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 13% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Analog Devices' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Analog Devices the TSR over the last 5 years was 102%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Analog Devices shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 10% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 20%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 15% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors.

New Visa Report Finds That Even Savvy Consumers Get Tripped Up by the Language of Fraud,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-know-spot-scam-visa-130000310.html,1668603600,STORY,['V'],"['Winning,' 'free gift,' 'exclusive deal,' 'act now' are among top language traps cited in Visa’s 'Fraudulese: The Language of Fraud' reportSAN FRANCISCO, November 16, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--It's not your imagination. Digital scams are everywhere in our daily lives. And as the holiday season approaches, fraudsters are counting on you to let your guard down and take the bait. Whether in the workplace or on the go, we're peppered by phone, text and email with offers for ""free gifts"" and traps to ""act now"" to supply personal information before a vital service gets cut off. And this barrage of ""fraudulese"" is working.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221116005258/en/A new research report out today from Visa (NYSE: V), in partnership with Wakefield Research, ""Fraudulese: The Language of Fraud,"" brings to light that when it comes to spotting scams, cybercriminals are finding vulnerabilities among even the most tech-savvy consumers. While nearly half of the population are confident they can recognize a scam, 73% are likely to miss the requisite red flags in digital communications.From a spoofed service notification from your electric company, to an email alerting you that you’ve won products from your favorite store, or even job postings that make it seem like you’ve been hired by a top-tier company, scams hit almost every touchpoint in our digital lives. In the last year alone, Visa has proactively blocked $7.2 billion in attempted fraudulent payments across 122 million transactions before those transactions impacted clients.""Understanding the language of fraud is increasingly essential in our digital-first world. Scammers have reached new heights of sophistication in both language and variety – no one is immune,"" said Paul Fabara, Chief Risk Officer, Visa. ""Education around the language of scams is an integral part of our consumer protection, and highlighting the commonalities in the language of fraud helps prevent crime globally.""Story continuesEarlier this year as part of Visa’s efforts to empower consumers to learn about the language of fraud, the company commissioned a first-of-its-kind linguistic analysis by researchers in the U.K. revealing how language can be used by fraudsters in short messages. The study revealed that solutions inviting consumers to engage with a problem or offer are the most common fraudulent message, occurring in 87% of the scam text messages, while problem statements that provoke action from the recipient were the second most common.""By highlighting the communicative strategies, words and phrases used by fraudsters, we hope people can more easily spot the language of fraud as it stands today, which ultimately helps to protect them,"" said Dr. Marton Petyko, from the Aston Institute for Forensic Linguistics, which conducted the U.K. research.Exploring The Language of Fraud: A Disconnect Between Awareness and ActionFalling victim to cyber fraud is costly. In 2021, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center reported a record number of complaints, with potential losses exceeding $6.9 billion, up from $4.1 billion in 2020.According to Visa’s new report, which surveyed 6,000 adults in 18 markets worldwide, scammers appear to be thriving in the gap between consumers’ awareness of the language of fraud and their actual behavior. Among the top findings:We think others are more susceptible to fraud than we are. While consumers feel confident in their own vigilance, the vast majority (90%) are concerned that friends or family members may fall for potential scams that include emails or text messages asking people to verify their account information, asking about overdrawn banking accounts and notifying them about winning a gift card or product from an online shopping site.The most enticing clickbait messages capitalize on consumer excitement, and fraudulently tout ""winning,"" ""exclusive deals"" or ""free gift,"" the survey found.Is it legitimate? More than 4 in 5 (81%) respondents check the wrong details to determine the authenticity of a communication, focusing on features scammers can easily fake, including the company’s name or logo (46%). Individuals can better protect themselves from fraudsters by checking details that are harder to fake, such as account numbers or details about their interactions with the company.Overlooking telltale signs. Only 60% of people reported looking to ensure a communication is sent from a valid email address. Fewer than half (47%) look to ensure words are spelled properly.Crypto users proceed with caution. Crypto users are more likely to identify the right kind of verifying elements of a potential scam than non-crypto owners. For example, they are more likely to check their account information (49% vs 37%) to confirm the validity of digital communications.Take a Few Extra Moments to Decipher FrauduleseConsumers can better protect themselves by taking a few extra moments before clicking, including taking time to understand the way fraudsters use language. Among simple, but effective best practices: Keep personal information to yourself. Don’t click on links before verifying they’ll take you where they say they will. Turn on purchase alerts, which provide near real-time notification by text message or email of purchases made with your account. Call the number on corporate websites or the back of your credit and debit cards if you are unsure if a communication is valid – don't just call the number possibly provided by the scammer in their text or email.Protection Is Visa’s Top PriorityWhile cybercrime persists in an increasingly digital world, Visa is mission-driven to protect consumers and mitigate fraud. Over the past five years, the company has invested more than $10 billion in technology, including to reduce fraud and increase network security. More than a thousand dedicated specialists protect Visa’s network from malware, zero-day attacks and insider threats 24x7x365. In fact, over the last 12 months, Visa’s real-time monitoring has proactively blocked over $7.2 billion in fraudulent payments, preventing many from ever knowing they were at risk of a potential fraudulent transaction.

The quarterly results were aided by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.Western Union reported third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 42 cents, which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. WU’s quarterly results were hurt by lower revenues and transactions in the Consumer-to-Consumer segment, which usually contributes a massive chunk to WU’s overall revenues.

As the frequency and intensity of weather events increases, it's not surprising that consumers are taking these issues into account when looking for a home. New research released today by Realtor.com® found that homebuyers generally show a preference for lower risk homes, which in turn appreciate at a slightly faster pace, and that the preference can be more pronounced in some areas of higher risk where awareness may be greater.Homes with less climate risk appreciate fasterHomes with a low risk of flood damage appreciate at 1.5 percentage points faster than homes with a high risk of flood damage. During the last flood-related disaster season (July - Sept. 2021), the growth rate gap increased to 1.7 percentage points, suggesting that flood risk was top-of-mind for buyers. Homes at low risk of wildfire appreciate at 3.7 percentage points faster than homes at high risk of wildfire. During the last wildfire season (July - Sept. 2021), the growth rate gap held steady at 3.7 percentage points, suggesting that awareness may be lower for wildfire than it is for flood.A recent Realtor.com® survey found that 71% of recent homebuyers considered the risk of natural disasters when deciding where to move and 47% are more concerned about natural disasters today than they were five years ago. Additionally, a 2021 Realtor.com® survey found that 34% of homeowners would consider moving or selling their home due to concerns about natural disasters.""Our data shows that users have a small but consistent preference toward lower risk homes. Buying a home is an extremely personal decision and many people are willing to take on more risk in order to have a water view or find a more affordable property,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""Consumers are increasingly aware of the risk that wildfires and flooding can have on their home. However, it's important to keep in mind that while climate-related risk is a factor that consumers might take into account, it is one of many considerations when deciding where to live and what home to purchase.""Story continuesHomebuyers weighing climate risks when shoppingHome shoppers on Realtor.com® who interact with the flood feature tend to shift toward viewing homes with lower risk than where they began. This is especially true in Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina where consumers shift to viewing details for homes with 5-7% lower risk scores. On the other hand, users in Mississippi shift from viewing homes with lower risk to homes with a higher risk of flooding, indicating that the users are willing to take some risk to find a property that meets their needs and may be more price sensitive.Wildfires seem to be less top-of-mind for home shoppers. In California, Oregon and Utah consumers who interact with the tool continue to look at homes with the same or similar risk scores. However, in Arizona, Florida and Mississippi, users of the tool tend to shift toward properties with higher risk, suggesting that awareness of wildfire risk might be lower than for flood or that consumers might be more price sensitive.""We felt that it was important to add natural disaster information to Realtor.com® to help home shoppers and homeowners better understand their risks and take preventative steps to help mitigate that risk,"" said Sara Brinton, lead product manager at Realtor.com®. ""In the two years since we added flood risk data to the site, it has become one of our most popular features and we're proud to be able to provide this important information to consumers so that they can make informed decisions during the home shopping process.""About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the broadcasting industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Broadcasting Companies in the World.The broadcasting industry has seen a paradigm shift in its dynamics after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of radio, newspapers, and televisions are now fading away in the past as digital streaming and digital broadcasting networks have experienced a sharp rise in consumption of late, with the likes of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime on the rise. According to research by Zenith, people spend more time than ever before viewing media, consuming about eight hours of media each day.Commercial broadcasting in the United States stretches back to the 1920s, when news bulletins, music programs, and live sporting events were first broadcasted into people's homes. Since then, the industry has continued to grow, and the U.S television industry alone stood at a market value of $210.4 billion in 2021, rising by $12.3 billion from 2020. Comcast Corporation and Fox Corporation remain two of the biggest broadcasting networks in the United States.However, it is interesting to note that although the sector keeps growing explosively in terms of its market size, the number of people employed in the US broadcasting sector has continued to fall in the past two decades. This is largely due to the rise of digital streaming platforms that require a substantially smaller number of people to operate as compared to radio or television.Digital platforms provide curated content to users as per their tastes and profiles. The overall experience is interactive and personalized for the user, which is what traditional media often lacks. Some examples of digital broadcasting companies include YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. The rise in traffic to digital streaming platforms has encouraged digital media companies to invest heavily in producing digital content. In 2020, Netflix invested $17 billion in content creation, up from $15.3 billion in 2019. The revenue for the digital streaming app industry is forecasted to reach $115 billion by 2026, from $72.2 billion in 2021.Story continuesPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization. In addition to TV, radio and telecommunications companies, we have also included major streaming companies in this list as they are taking the form of mainstream broadcasters as streaming replaces TV in households worldwide.15. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE)Market Cap: $1.51 billionParamount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) is a global media and entertainment corporation that develops content for viewers worldwide.

(NYSE:ATUS)Market Cap: $2.87 billionAltice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) is a French multinational mass media and telecommunication company. Altice USA, Inc. has spread its operation in four regions – Western Europe, Israel, the United States, and Overseas Territories. The company has become the second-largest telecommunication company in France. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) has over 50 million TV, phone, and internet corporate and residential customers.

(NYSE:ATUS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Two (very) costly mistakes I've made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) and Poshmark. Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality, I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up the case that we pay over intrinsic value, at worst case we should never lose money on an investment. I will dive into one of these mistakes below and maybe dive into the other in a future letter. My thinking when buying Altice USA was that they operate as a duopoly in their main footprint, the New York Tri-State area. They provide a needs-based service: internet, video, and voice services. I figured this is a very stable business with high barriers to entry. Management seemed competent as well based on historical capital allocation decisions. I didn't fully appreciate at the time how poorly positioned they were relative to Verizon Fios, as well as how fiercely competitive the business can get on promotions and customer acquisition.Altice offers hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) while Fios offers fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). FTTH is a far superior product, which has led to some share loss to Fios in the parts of their footprint that overlap. There have also been some subscriber losses in their other footprint due to new cable entrants and fixed wireless offerings (…read more)13.

DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS's cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish's long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration's infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.11.

The decline was primarily driven by a softening in investor sentiment towards News Corp's Digital Real Estate assets against a backdrop of rising interest rates in both Australia and the U.S., with REA Group shares down 17% during the quarter. While concerns over property market drivers are likely to continue in the near term, we see both REA Group and Move as being well positioned to structurally improve their businesses through this period.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the , Tamara Erwin, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$37.70. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.

Because of global supply chain issues ""air carriers will likely be unable to fully meet either the December 2022 deadlines for smaller regional aircraft and many large transports nor the July 2023 retrofit deadline,"" it added.""Our aviation coalition strongly believes that instead of once again waiting until the eleventh hour, now is the time for the leadership at federal agencies and the White House to implement a solution that allows 5G to move forward and avoid further flight delays and cancellations,"" the letter said.FAA acting Administrator Billy Nolen urged a delay in some 5G C-Band transmissions from smaller operators over aviation safety concerns.The aviation industry letter said that since January ""the FAA has documented over 100 FAA incidents of potential 5G interference ... Unfortunately, the US government agencies do not appear to be on the same page with respect to these safety issues.""The FAA and White House did not immediately comment.Nolen said in his Oct. 21 letter, which was first reported by Reuters, that the FAA wants the Federal Communications Commission to mandate voluntary mitigations AT&amp;T and Verizon agreed to earlier this year for 19 smaller telecoms and other spectrum holders.Story continuesThe aviation letter Tuesday said ""inter-agency government progress appears to be at a stalemate, while stakeholders are doing their part to address these issue.""Verizon and AT&amp;T in June voluntarily agreed to delay some C-Band 5G usage until July 2023.Airline CEOs on Jan. 17 had warned of an impending ""catastrophic"" aviation crisis that could ground almost all traffic because of the 5G deployment.A deal struck shortly before a January deadline did not prevent dozens of foreign carriers from canceling international flights to the United States.

257,2f14c469-38ca-3d46-8a3e-1bd195fdff68,NVDA,2022-11-16,Selling US$176m worth of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-176m-worth-nvidia-110033464.html,1668596433,STORY,['NVDA'],"[Despite the fact that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 14% last week, insiders who sold US$176m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$194, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA NVIDIA Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Mark Stevens, for US$51m worth of shares, at about US$186 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$167). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year NVIDIA insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At NVIDIA Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of NVIDIA shares. Specifically, Independent Director Mark Stevens ditched US$20m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. NVIDIA insiders own 4.0% of the company, currently worth about US$17b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About NVIDIA Insiders?An insider sold NVIDIA shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that NVIDIA is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Its COVID-19 vaccine together with the oral antiviral pill for COVID-19, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022.

The company continues to expand organically and bolster its digital consumer banking platform.Other than business diversification, robust client engagement, a solid position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), and a decent investment banking (IB) backlog are likely to aid in navigating weaker markets.

The company supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs are weighing on the company’s performance. Weakness in the Power and Renewable energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.Foreign currency headwinds are hurting the company’s top line. The company’s strong performance of the Aerospace and Healthcare segments is driving General Electric’s growth. Its investments in productivity and innovation should fuel growth going forward.Cost-control measures and pricing actions are aiding its bottom line. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders are encouraging. In the first nine months of 2022, General Electric paid dividends of $455 million to shareholders and repurchased shares worth $0.6 billion.(You can read the full research report on General Electric here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Truist Financial Corp.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the broadcasting industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Broadcasting Companies in the World.The broadcasting industry has seen a paradigm shift in its dynamics after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The days of radio, newspapers, and televisions are now fading away in the past as digital streaming and digital broadcasting networks have experienced a sharp rise in consumption of late, with the likes of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime on the rise. According to research by Zenith, people spend more time than ever before viewing media, consuming about eight hours of media each day.Commercial broadcasting in the United States stretches back to the 1920s, when news bulletins, music programs, and live sporting events were first broadcasted into people's homes. Since then, the industry has continued to grow, and the U.S television industry alone stood at a market value of $210.4 billion in 2021, rising by $12.3 billion from 2020. Comcast Corporation and Fox Corporation remain two of the biggest broadcasting networks in the United States.However, it is interesting to note that although the sector keeps growing explosively in terms of its market size, the number of people employed in the US broadcasting sector has continued to fall in the past two decades. This is largely due to the rise of digital streaming platforms that require a substantially smaller number of people to operate as compared to radio or television.Digital platforms provide curated content to users as per their tastes and profiles. The overall experience is interactive and personalized for the user, which is what traditional media often lacks. Some examples of digital broadcasting companies include YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. The rise in traffic to digital streaming platforms has encouraged digital media companies to invest heavily in producing digital content. In 2020, Netflix invested $17 billion in content creation, up from $15.3 billion in 2019. The revenue for the digital streaming app industry is forecasted to reach $115 billion by 2026, from $72.2 billion in 2021.Story continuesPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization. In addition to TV, radio and telecommunications companies, we have also included major streaming companies in this list as they are taking the form of mainstream broadcasters as streaming replaces TV in households worldwide.15. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE)Market Cap: $1.51 billionParamount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) is a global media and entertainment corporation that develops content for viewers worldwide. The corporation has the industry's most important and vast libraries of TV and film titles. Its portfolio includes some of the top media networks, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Colors, VH1, and many more. Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) also owns Simon &amp; Schuster, VidCon, and Bellator. The company was previously named ViacomCBS Inc. and renamed itself Paramount Global in February 2022.Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE) revenue for 2021 was reported at $702.7 million, a 1% increase from the previous year's $695.9 million.In addition to Paramount Group, Inc. (NYSE:PGRE), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are included in our list of 15 biggest broadcasting companies in the world.14. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS)Market Cap: $2.87 billionAltice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) is a French multinational mass media and telecommunication company. Altice USA, Inc. has spread its operation in four regions – Western Europe, Israel, the United States, and Overseas Territories. The company has become the second-largest telecommunication company in France. Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) has over 50 million TV, phone, and internet corporate and residential customers. In 2017, the company expanded its online advertising business by acquiring Teads.The company's revenue for 2021 stood at $10.09 billion, recording an increase of 1.98% from $9.89 billion in 2020.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, MPE Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Two (very) costly mistakes I've made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA, Inc. (NYSE:ATUS) and Poshmark. Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality, I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up the case that we pay over intrinsic value, at worst case we should never lose money on an investment. I will dive into one of these mistakes below and maybe dive into the other in a future letter. My thinking when buying Altice USA was that they operate as a duopoly in their main footprint, the New York Tri-State area. They provide a needs-based service: internet, video, and voice services. I figured this is a very stable business with high barriers to entry. Management seemed competent as well based on historical capital allocation decisions. I didn't fully appreciate at the time how poorly positioned they were relative to Verizon Fios, as well as how fiercely competitive the business can get on promotions and customer acquisition.Altice offers hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) while Fios offers fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). FTTH is a far superior product, which has led to some share loss to Fios in the parts of their footprint that overlap. There have also been some subscriber losses in their other footprint due to new cable entrants and fixed wireless offerings (…read more)13. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS)Market Cap: $3.09 billionZee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (NSE:ZEEL.NS) is an Indian company active in the content and broadcasting segments.

DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH)Market Cap: $7.50 billionDISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) was established in 1996 in the United States. The company has two main business subdivisions: Pay-Tv and Wireless. Pay-Tv subdivision offers its services under the DISH and the SLING brand.

DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS's cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish's long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration's infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.11.

The decline was primarily driven by a softening in investor sentiment towards News Corp's Digital Real Estate assets against a backdrop of rising interest rates in both Australia and the U.S., with REA Group shares down 17% during the quarter. While concerns over property market drivers are likely to continue in the near term, we see both REA Group and Move as being well positioned to structurally improve their businesses through this period.

If you want to skip our introduction to the industry and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Biggest Midstream Companies Heading Into 2023. The oil and gas industry has been the star performer in the stock markets this year, as the energy crisis ushered in by the Russian war in Ukraine drove investors to a sector that only recently was placed right at the heart of climate change. Populations in developing and developed nations alike suffered from high gasoline prices since the global oil market faced a demand imbalance in the wake of increased demand for non-Russian oil.Now, the consensus is that there is an underinvestment in oil exploration, and this give and take between high costs and investment in energy exploration was summarized perfectly by hedge fund boss and billionaire Mr. Ken Fisher in an interview he gave in June 2022. Taking stock of the current situation, Mr. Fisher outlined:. . .Rising prices do have a negative impact on the desire to consume and GDP are real, but I want to point out that there's counterbalances to all these features and these are ones that people don't think about at a time like this. Rising energy prices inherently create a greater desire on a global basis to invest in energy, in the ground, or other ways. And there's a fairly long history that shows that that's a tight correlation. And what that does is that it buoys the economy. The fundamental feature is that partly, when the price of energy is up, people choose to do maybe something that they wouldn't do otherwise, maybe drive a little less, maybe do something else. But in doing that they're also still spending money. To the extent they suffer the consequences of the price of energy, the counterbalance is that somebody, somewhere is investing in creating more energy, and that's helping somebody.Today's list focuses on the midstream oil and gas sector, and these firms primarily serve as the link between the oil producers and the end consumer.

Price and EPS SurpriseWoodward, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Woodward, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe company’s performance in the fourth quarter is likely to have benefited from continued momentum in the company’s aerospace segment. The segment is expected to have benefited from higher commercial OEM and aftermarket sales resulting from improving passenger traffic and aircraft utilization, along with higher OEM production rates.Also, a rise in U.S. defense spending as a result of rising geopolitical tensions and a minor increase in U.S. defense procurement is likely to have boosted the segment’s revenues.For fiscal 2022, the company expects Aerospace segment revenues increase between 8% and 10%. Also, earnings as a percent of segment net sales are expected to be approximately 15%.In October, Woodward announced that it is consolidating the company’s different business groups under its existing business segments - Aerospace and Industrial. Under the new organizational restructuring, Aircraft Turbine Systems and Aero Systems will now be merged within the Aerospace segment.The company expects the power generation market to pick up pace, owing to rising demand for industrial turbo machinery and backup power at data centers.The company continues to invest in research and development to minimize fuel consumption and emissions and to aid clients to tackle increasing fuel and motion control challenges and help them develop clean fuel for running engines.Story continuesHowever, the company has lowered its guidance for fiscal 2022 owing to supply-chain and labor disruptions; and inflation.

The company recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 billion net of tax. The charge reflected the impact of macroeconomic factors as a result of weakened global demand, higher cost of capital, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased raw material, supply chain and service costs.RevenuesRevenues in the quarter under review amounted to $947 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. The top line decreased 8.9% year over year. Sales were down 0.7% on an organic basis.Management stated that it is encouraged by the double-digit growth in clear aligners, solid performance in Europe, and continued strong demand for Imaging equipment amid continued macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness in the United States and China.

The company saw continued strong demand for Imaging equipment during the quarter as well as in European businesses.

It has amassed assets over $9.62 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap BlendCompared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.60%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 17.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Devon Energy Corp (DVN) accounts for about 1.03% of total assets, followed by Vici Pptys Inc (VICI) and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc Series (WBD).The top 10 holdings account for about 6.86% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHM seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index. The Index includes the mid-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace and includes the components ranked 501-1000 by full market capitalization.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -13.52% so far this year and is down about -15.80% in the last one year (as of 11/16/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $60.50 and $82.64.The ETF has a beta of 1.12 and standard deviation of 28.46% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 499 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. MidCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHM is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $51.36 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF has $65.70 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To date in 2022, we have acquired approximately $78 million of annual revenue. Acquisitions remain a key component of our growth strategy and we continue to have a robust pipeline of opportunities across multiple geographies, products, and end markets.”IBP’s Acquisition DriveAcquisitions have been a preferred mode of expansion for IBP for years. The company’s persistent focus on prioritizing profitable growth through acquiring well-run installers of insulation and complementary building products bodes well.In September, IBP acquired a Longwood, FL-based installer of spray foam and fiberglass insulation — All Florida Insulation, LLC — with annual revenue of approximately $2.4 million.In May, it acquired Statewide Insulation, Inc. (known as Tri-County Insulation and Acoustical Contractors), an installer of fiberglass insulation, spray foam insulation, and acoustical ceiling insulation into new residential, multifamily, and commercial projects in California.In 2021, the company wrapped up 12 acquisitions, representing approximately $211 million of annual revenues, more than doubling IBP’s $100 million acquired revenue target for 2021.

294,fe420d3d-ee31-3b12-b104-0e97607aecbc,URI,2022-11-16,Sustainability at United Rentals,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sustainability-united-rentals-151000738.html,1668525000,STORY,['URI'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 15, 2022 / United Rentals, Inc.OverviewAt United Rentals, we are committed to building a better future together. We Work UnitedTM with our customers, communities and employees to find solutions with a shared commitment to service and safety. That includes doing our part to protect the planet, including shrinking the carbon footprint of equipment used on construction and industrial worksites.Renting equipment is often a more sustainable choice compared with purchasing equipment, and our business model is one that supports the sharing economy. But we aim to go further.Our pursuit of sustainability excellence targets three areas.First, we're looking inward, focusing on how our company can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our non-rental fleets, buildings and operations.Second, we're helping our customers reduce their emissions through advances in our rental fleet.Third, we're supporting our customers' efforts to meet their own environmental stewardship goals as a strategic partner with innovative solutions.Why take these steps? Because it's the right thing to do. By living our core values and putting our customers, people and planet at the heart of our operations and decision- making, United Rentals continues to build long-term value for all stakeholders.Reducing emissions across our businessUnited Rentals' commitment to environmental stewardship starts with our own facilities and day-to-day business operations. A focal point of our climate action efforts is reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby doing our part to limit global temperature rise.To understand our total carbon footprint, we first looked at our emissions according to the three scopes of GHG emissions defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (right).After evaluating numerous options for reduction targets, we committed to reduce GHG emissions intensity 35% by 2030, from a 2018 baseline. Our GHG emissions intensity metric measures scope 1 and 2 emissions and scope 3 emissions from third party haulers per million dollars of revenue.Story continuesHere are some steps we're taking to work toward reaching our goal.Decreasing emissions from our vehicle fleetReducing emissions from our non-rental fleet is one of our top priorities. Regular turnover of our sales, service and delivery vehicles provides the opportunity to purchase the best available vehicles in terms of design and performance. That increasingly means electric, hybrid and alternatively fueled vehicles.An agreement we entered into with Ford Motor Company in 2022 marks our first electric pickup purchase, which adds F-150 Lightning trucks and E-Transit vans to our fleet beginning in 2022. The F-150 Lightning has a maximum target range of 300 miles and a maximum towing capacity of 10,000 pounds. The E-Transit, an all-electric commercial cargo van, has a target range of 130 miles. Both models are equipped with intelligent back-up power and an array of connectivity features. Non- rental electric pickups will help us meet our emission reduction goals, while rental electrical vehicles (EVs) will help our customers meet theirs.As we expand our non-rental fleet to include more EVs, we are working to address the challenge of providing sufficient power availability for charging those vehicles at branches and, for employees who take vehicles home, at homes. Factors to consider as we examine which markets and geographic locations to focus on include the range of the EVs and the availability of electricity.Electric isn't yet a viable option for all vehicles. Where it isn't a possibility, we're continuing to pursue cleaner choices. For example, we're looking to pilot a propane vehicle in the medium duty sector. Replacing some diesel vehicles in our fleet with propane vehicles could significantly reduce GHG emissions for those vehicles. Additionally, as the industry leader, we are working with equipment manufacturers to explore other sustainable equipment and encourage them to expand their sustainable offerings.Of course, optimizing fleet logistics remains a key strategy for reducing our carbon footprint. Part of our field automation systems technology (FAST) program includes information to provide optimal delivery and pickup routes and loads while increasing trailer deck space. This reduces the number of miles driven, lowering fuel consumption and the associated costs and emissions.In addition, we're empowering our drivers to reduce emissions. We track and report indicators such as engine idling time and hard braking so drivers can make adjustments that reduce the environmental impact of driving. We're also developing custom anti-idling stickers for our rental and non-rental fleets to remind drivers to shut off their engines.Achieving greater efficiency in our buildings and propertiesWith rental locations in 49 states and around the globe, United Rentals has a powerful opportunity to further reduce GHG emissions by adopting more efficient technologies in our buildings and properties.For many years we have been retrofitting lighting in our buildings, updating to more efficient technologies as they become available. Our goal: Complete lighting retrofits for 95% of our North American operations by 2025.We're also continuing our heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) preventive maintenance program, which helps increase the efficiency of our corporate office spaces and warehouses.When it comes to new construction, we conduct a close review of specs with an eye toward greater efficiency, enterprise control systems and onsite energy production.Given that about 10% of our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions come from electricity use, shifting to renewable energy sources is another focus. With support from a third party expert, we're developing a renewable energy strategy. Based on our business model and geography, a successful renewable energy strategy will likely require multiple pathways and investments in several programs. Areas of exploration include onsite solar power and virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs).Additionally, we have purchased renewable energy credits (RECs). These let us pay for renewable energy production without directly obtaining the energy from renewable sources. We've acquired 25 MWh of RECs so far, which accounts for approximately 25% of company energy use in 2021.Work United to create changeThe passion within our company for doing well by doing good is evidenced by the overwhelming response to the formation of Planet United, an employee resource group (ERG) aimed at making our planet a better place to live. Members of this new ERG will lead and engage other employees in pro- environment activities and drive increased internal dialogue around sustainability.At the launch meeting in early 2022, hundreds of employees proved eager to brainstorm ways to work toward our company's sustainability goals and to create positive impacts that extend to our customers and to our respective communities.Planet United is focusing on projects such as providing environmental feedback to relevant departments, holding battery recycling contests, establishing water cooler programs to eliminate single-use plastic water bottles, and engaging with local and national environmental groups.In addition to creating Planet United, we established a Sustainability Steering Committee. This cross-functional team of senior leaders and subject matter experts from across the company is helping to develop strategies for addressing the current and future sustainability needs of our company and our customers, and to ensure strong coordination in the implementation of those strategies.Responsible companies lead with purpose. And we believe that when we Work United, our more than 20,000 team members can have a huge impact. As such, and in honor of our company's 25th anniversary, we've designated November 2022 as our Month of Impact. In 2022 the goal is to dedicate 25,000 hours to making a positive difference in our locations and communities.Helping customers shrink their environmental footprintAs the world's largest rental equipment company, United Rentals has a strong influence across industrial and construction worksites. We're committed to providing solutions that help our customers create lower-emission worksites without compromising safety or productivity.Our current rental fleet has many low- and zero-emission options. Electric or hybrid units represent about 27% of our rental fleet, and our agreement with Ford Motor Company will add hundreds of new pickup trucks and cargo vans to the EV count.The sheer number of vehicles and equipment units we purchase affords us opportunities to collaborate with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In communicating with these manufacturers, we articulate our sustainability goals and customers' requests for environmentally friendly equipment and look for ways to work together to fulfill their needs.We announced two exciting advancements in our rental equipment in 2022, both developed out of relationships with OEMs.First, we worked with Powr2 Energy Solutions to develop POWRBANK, a zero-emission portable energy storage solution that integrates with diesel generators. POWRBANK will enable our customers to significantly reduce generator run time and reduce emissions, noise and fuel waste. Composed of high- density lithium batteries, inverters and load-sensing technology, it absorbs fluctuations in load while providing power, then engages the generator when the batteries are near depletion.Second, the first 100 units of a new electric compact excavator, the TB20e from Takeuchi, will soon be available at select rental locations in North America. This excavator, the first of what will be a full line of electric products from Takeuchi, is 100% battery powered with zero emissions and reduced noise and vibration levels.We're working with other OEMs to add even more eco- friendly rental equipment to our mix, including more electric, dual fuel or hybrid forklifts, aerial lifts and skid steers, as well as solar-powered and LED light towers.To stay forward-focused, we'll continue to regularly communicate with OEMs and customers about trends, changing needs and upcoming equipment offerings.Partnering with customers around their own sustainability strategiesUnited Rentals knows equipment and worksites. As our customers build plans to achieve their own sustainability goals, we can help them reduce their equipment footprint by assisting with strategies, visibility and tracking.Expansion of low- and zero-emissions rental equipment options will play a key role. In addition, we are actively pursuing tools to help customers monitor and manage their environmental impact.In Total Control®, our proprietary cloud-based fleet management system, customers can track engine hours and use that information to help reduce engine idling and improve compliance with company idling policies. Total Control can also track utilization, which helps users right-size their fleet and, in turn, conserve natural resources.Additionally, customers can now track their rental equipment's GHG emissions through Total Control. The emissions reporting feature calculates estimated emissions based on estimated fuel burn and emissions factor by fuel type.

As of November 2022, the billionaire has a real-time net worth of $1.5 billion, according to Forbes.In one of his interviews with Business Insider this October, Klarman mentioned that value investing mainly involves realizing a company’s worth and not its overall returns. He further mentioned that investors today are drawn to new investing ideas and assets, but the main focus should be on the long-term opportunities provided by these assets. In his interview with Harvard Business School in June, Klarman asserted that gold is one of the safest assets in the current market environment and investors should have gold assets in their portfolios.As of the close of Q3 2022, Baupost Group held a 13F portfolio valued at roughly $5.8 billion, compared with $6.7 billion in the previous quarter.

This takes the dividend yield to 2.3%, which shareholders will be pleased with. View our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, McDonald's was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. The company is clearly earning enough to pay this type of dividend, but it is definitely focused on returning cash to shareholders, rather than growing the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 52.9% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 49% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMcDonald's Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $2.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $6.08. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.McDonald's May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 3.0% per year. Growth of 3.0% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future.In SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, but generally we are not too happy with the payments McDonald's has been making. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines.

(NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, today unveiled two significant electric truck charging installations as part of its Prologis Mobility platform. The two charging sites will enable Performance Team, a leading national logistics company, to simultaneously charge up to 38 of its Volvo VNR Electric Class 8 battery-electric trucks.Prologis is helping its customers transition their commercial fleets to zero emissions transportation, spanning heavy duty trucks (18 wheels) to last-mile vans. With more than 1.2 billion square feet of logistics properties around the globe, deep development expertise and relationships with some of the world's largest brands, the company is uniquely positioned to help accelerate the adoption of electric fleets. Prologis Mobility integrates energy supply with charging infrastructure, installation, operations and fleet management software without any upfront costs.""Fleet electrification is a major priority for our customers and, as part of our Essentials platform, Prologis Mobility offers a turnkey solution that simplifies the transition to zero emissions vehicles,"" said Prologis Co-founder and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam. ""This unique offering allows our customers to focus on their core business while making progress on their sustainability goals.""Debuts Nation's Largest Commercial Truck Charging Installations Prologis and Performance Team are working together to install EV charging infrastructure in several large U.S. industrial markets. The companies started in Southern California, home to two of the nation's busiest ports.Today, two large installations are up and running, energizing a total of 38 new electric trucks that are reducing noise and emissions on Southern California roadways. The projects – one in Sante Fe Springs and the other in the City of Commerce – provide more than 4 megawatts of total installed charging capacity.Story continuesSanta Fe Springs – Located at a non-Prologis-owned logistics facility, this project went live in late summer 2022 with the capacity to charge 16 trucks at once. Drivers have already clocked nearly 100,000 miles running short haul trips in the Los Angeles market. Because charging happens right at the warehouse, trucks do not have to be diverted for fueling outside of their most optimal routes, saving time and energy.Commerce Transport Center – The newest project to come online, the Commerce Transport Center, started operations in late October, well within a year of initial project design. The project is estimated to provide Performance Team with more than 4 million kWh of energy annually to fuel 22 trucks. Prologis Mobility managed the design and installation of the project, as well as the engagement with the local utility, Southern California Edison, greatly simplifying the process for Performance Team.""We'd like to thank our logistics real estate partner Prologis for their efforts to support our decarbonization strategy goals. These new charging stations will enable faster turn times of our electric fleet while in our distribution centers and optimize our route deployment in sustainable ways,"" said Jason Walker, chief operating officer of Performance Team.Simple, Fast and EverywherePrologis Mobility leverages deep internal expertise in EV, utility engagement and industrial real estate development to deliver innovative solutions with simple usage-based pricing:Comprehensive Solution in a Simple Model: The turn-key solution includes design and construction, hardware, energy procurement, 24/7 operations monitoring and maintenance.Compelling Economic Model with No Upfront Costs: The Infrastructure-as-a-Service model means no upfront expenditures for customers.Rapid Deployment: From utility engagement to entitlement and permitting - and everything in-between, projects are commissioned fast and seamlessly.Serving Customers Where They Operate: Prologis Mobility works within the company's portfolio as well as with third-party landlords. Additionally, Prologis is developing stand-alone hubs to provide broader coverage across multiple short-haul, last mile and internodal truck routes.""Logistics real estate can and will play a critical role in the move toward a carbon-free transportation future,"" said Henrik Holland, global head of Prologis Mobility. ""Prologis is enabling the transition with a simple, fast solution for our customers' electrification needs as they look to zero-emission fleets.""In addition to helping the logistics industry with its transition to electric vehicles, the Prologis Mobility team is working on other options of sustainable energy, such as hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and Compressed and Renewable natural gas (CNG/RNG).California and New York to Businesses: ""All new trucks to be zero emissions by 2045""The move to EV within commercial trucking is driven by forces in both the public and private sectors. On the public side, the State of California has a target of 100 percent of passenger and light-duty truck sales to be zero-emissions by 2035, medium and heavy-duty trucks by 2045 and drayage trucks by 2035. California is the first in the world to require heavy-duty manufacturers to transition to zero-emissions by 2045. The State of New York has set similar goals.At the same time, more and more logistics companies are setting ambitious sustainability objectives, including net zero goals. Prologis teams work hard to understand their customers' businesses, including their sustainability goals. With that knowledge, the company brings a wide variety of climate-friendly solutions to the table, including EV, renewable energy, smart buildings, sustainable construction technologies and more.For businesses looking for more information on Prologis Mobility, please reach out to the team by contacting Dan Loflin, head of commercial, Prologis Mobility (DLoflin@prologis.com; 415-733-9466).For information on Prologis' business strategies and accomplishments, click here for the company's latest investor presentation for the 2022 NAREIT's REITWorld Conference.Reporters: Photo assets can be found here.

Anthony Quintano / FlickrTripadvisor is considering revamping its Tripadvisor Plus membership plan, turning it into a free service in its initial stages, and then figuring out a more meaningful path to monetize it at some point later.CEO Matt Goldberg, who replaced longtime boss Steve Kaufer on July 1, said his team didn’t want to come in and just end Tripadvisor Plus, and is mulling ways to potentially save the program, although no decisions have been made.The subscription plan, which has a $99 annual fee and offers cash back or discounts on hotel stays and other products, became a flashpoint and was downplayed in marketing under Kaufer starting in September 2021 after hotel chains balked at partnering in it over seeming violations of rate parity norms. Some big hotel brands took exception to Tripadvisor showing travelers hotel rates that were lower than they were displaying on their own websites.Speaking at the Phocuswright conference in Phoenix, Arizona Tuesday, Goldberg said it was a lot to ask travelers to lay out $99 up-front, and that there may be a way to elicit more meaningful membership economics at a later juncture. On the other hand, Spanish online flight and hotel seller eDreams Odigeo has a booming subscription program with 3.8 million members as of this month, although the annual fee is about half of what Tripadvisor charges.Goldberg also said the Tripadvisor app hasn’t been as successful as it could be. He said he recently used the app to find a restaurant, and to view nearby eateries and experiences, but it was “difficult.” He said the company will explore how to improve the Tripadvisor app to make it more valuable for consumers, and this likely will take the app into the “destination space.”Markets Ruled Out a Viator IPO for NowIn other news, Goldberg lauded the performance of a Tripadvisor experiences’ brands, Viator, and said financial markets ruled out in the near term taking Viator public on its own. In February, well before Goldberg’s hiring, Tripadvisor filed a confidential registration statement for a Viator initial public offering.Story continuesHe said Tripadvisor will not wait around for market conditions to change, but will focus on the opportunity that Viator has before it. No decisions have been made on whether to take Viator public, Goldberg said, adding when the markets change “I’m sure we’ll talk about what we shall do.”Viator saw its third quarter revenue jump 138 percent year over year to $174 million.Goldberg said Tripadvisor will rely on its heritage of being a trusted brand, one that consumers trust more than Google. He said while “Google Maps is good for a moment in time,” Tripadvisor can add more insight about destinations or venues.Strategy decisions that Tripadvisor makes about its future will likely be financially impactful in the first half of 2023, he said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

315,4ae1d39f-02cc-376b-811e-ec4669ad818d,TROW,2022-11-16,Is T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value (TRMCX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-mid-cap-120012516.html,1668513612,STORY,['TROW'],"[There are plenty of choices in the Mutual Fund Equity Report category, but where should you start your research? Well, one fund that might be worth investigating is T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value (TRMCX). TRMCX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of TRMCX. Since T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value made its debut in June of 1996, TRMCX has garnered more than $4.01 billion in assets. David J. Wallack is the fund's current manager and has held that role since December of 2000.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 7.38%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 11.03%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of TRMCX over the past three years is 23.63% compared to the category average of 18.38%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 20.39% compared to the category average of 16.21%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. TRMCX has a 5-year beta of 1, which means it is likely to be as volatile as the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. TRMCX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -2.35, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, TRMCX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.81% compared to the category average of 1.10%. From a cost perspective, TRMCX is actually cheaper than its peers.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value ( TRMCX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value ( TRMCX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Want even more information about TRMCX?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Fisher Asset Management founder Ken Fisher believes the Federal Reserve's actions will not help control inflation but also stressed that the U.S. economy is unlikely to plunge into recession, given that loan growth is ""robust."" He told Fox Business on November 3: “I don’t believe what the Fed is doing right now actually kills inflation. I don’t believe, as I have said before, that the Fed can kneecap the economy by raising rates the way it is because right now the banks' loan base cost them almost nothing. When the Fed raises short rates it increases the incentive for banks to make short-term loans because the spread gets bigger.”Ken Fisher recently pointed out some positive fundamentals that investors might be missing due to the uncertainty and short-term headwinds blanketing the stock market currently. In addition to strong bank loan growth, unemployment remains low in the United States, and travel is exceptionally robust and increasing. Historically, these factors are inconsistent with the beginnings of recessions, as per Fisher. Some of the top holdings in the Ken Fisher portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 stocks from the Ken Fisher portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksKen Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,604,616,000Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Fisher Asset Management held 11.8 million shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), worth $1.60 billion and representing 1.2% of the total 13F portfolio. Ken Fisher strengthened his hold on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by 3% in the September quarter. The stock has been part of the Fisher portfolio since the first quarter of 2014. Story continuesOn November 15, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) filed to exchange up to $2.75 billion of 3.500% senior notes due 2027. The filing also suggests an offering to exchange $3 billion of 3.850% senior notes due 2032, $2.75 billion of 4.450% senior notes due 2052, and $1.5 billion of 4.650% senior notes due 2062. Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps on November 10 reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) but lowered the price target on the shares to $170 from $200. The analyst said she trimmed her price target to factor in the latest multiple compression and views the layoffs and hiring freeze announcements as incrementally optimistic, particularly due to the ongoing macro uncertainty and the industry-wide weakness in digital advertising.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 184 hedge funds were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 200 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 7.3 million shares worth $1.17 billion. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also backed by Ken Fisher. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks, underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet, which we don’t own, as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021, negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses.While we have trimmed our position close to 20%, we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds, we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industry wide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years, helping to re-accelerate revenue growth.We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures, which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly, we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,722,650,000Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, the United States, and internationally. Ken Fisher, as of Q3 2022, owns over 25 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) worth $1.7 billion, representing 1.29% of his total 13F portfolio. On November 10, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares climbed approximately 5% as the company said its October sales rose 56% year-over-year. For the month ending October 2022, the company generated NT$210.3 billion in revenue, up from NT$134.5 billion in the same period a year ago. Goldman Sachs analyst Bruce Lu downgraded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) on October 13 to Buy from Conviction Buy with a price target of $89, down from $126. The analyst noted that the company's management has turned ""more conservative"", given an impact from demand weakness, especially for its N7 nodes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) management has also guided down 2022 capex to $36 billion from nearly $40 billion, partially due to uncertain demand, the analyst told investors.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 72 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 81 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 14.6 million shares worth $1.19 billion. Baron Funds made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,830,503,000Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a California-based customer relationship management technology company, is one of the top picks from the Ken Fisher stock portfolio. Fisher owns 12.7 million shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) worth $1.8 billion as of Q3 2022, representing 1.37% of the total 13F securities. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz on November 15 maintained a Buy recommendation on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $225 from $235. Macro and geopolitical factors have continued to hammer the software sector, and many investors ""understandably remain cautious about increasing their software exposure at this time,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 116 hedge funds were long Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 114 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates held a prominent stake in the company, comprising more than 5 million shares worth $829 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Software has been a solid long-term performer for the Strategy and a key point of differentiation versus the benchmark. But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles.We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy. We also see significant room for margin expansion. While we have trimmed our Salesforce (CRM) exposure, we maintain confidence that the stock will re-rate to a level that reflects its growth potential.”7. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $1,949,619,000ASML Holding N.V.

(NASDAQ:ASML), compared to 46 funds in the preceding quarter. Arrowstreet Capital held a significant position in the company, with 726,787 shares worth about $346 million. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“ASML Holding N.V. designs and manufactures semiconductor production equipment. It specializes in photolithography equipment, where light sources are used to photo-reactively create patterns on wafers that become printed circuits. ASML is the dominant leader across all types of lithography but, most importantly, is the only company selling equipment for extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography, the latest generation technology.Indeed, because of the stalling out of Moore’s Law, advanced lithography of larger and multi-patterned silicon chips has been critical for leading-edge chip manufacturing and continued improvement in semiconductor chip performance over time. The company is well positioned to continue growing above industry rates as it rapidly adds capacity across its entire business to meet rising industry demand, especially from leading-edge customers continuing to invest to stay ahead of their competitors and drive chip performance forward.Additionally, the introduction of high-NA EUV technology in the middle of the decade will add another leg to the growth opportunity.”6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $2,028,883,000American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American multinational firm that provides credit card products and travel-related services worldwide.

The revenue of $13.56 billion climbed 24.1% year-over-year, falling short of Wall Street consensus by $20 million. Based on the company’s performance to date, it still expects full-year 2022 revenue growth of 23% to 25%, compared to a 25.24% consensus. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) now forecasts to clock in ahead of its original full-year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65, versus a $9.84 consensus.Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti on October 24 reiterated an Overweight rating on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) but slashed the price target on the shares to $170 from $180 following the Q3 results. Increased funding costs have had a fairly neutral effect so far, though over time it will become a moderate headwind, the analyst contended.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 67 hedge funds were bullish on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 69 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest position holder in the company. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the top picks of Ken Fisher as of Q3 2022. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.” Click to continue reading and see Ken Fisher Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:12 Best Construction Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Tech Companies in the WorldTop IoT Companies in the World Disclosure: None.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”22.

The study achieved its primary endpoint of generating a superior antibody response in study participants compared with the booster dose of Spikevax. The bivalent vaccines also met non-inferiority immunogenicity criteria to the original strain.The bivalent vaccine contains an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron variants. While mRNA-1273.222 contains the spike protein in the BA.4/5 Omicron subvariants, mRNA-1273.214 contains the spike protein in the BA.1 Omicron subvariant.An exploratory data analysis also revealed that both the bivalent vaccines demonstrated robust neutralizing activity against BQ.1.1, an emerging COVID-19 variant. The result from this analysis confirmed that the bivalent vaccines are effective against new and evolving variants. However, the neutralizing activity of these vaccines against the BQ.1.1 variant dropped 5-fold in titers compared with the BA.4/5 variants.Shares of Moderna have declined 29.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s 19.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement also stated that the frequency of adverse events observed in patients administered the bivalent vaccines was less than compared with participants who had received the second or third dose of Spikevax.This August, the FDA granted EUA to Moderna and Pfizer PFE/BioNTech’s BNTX Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines for a single booster dose. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna booster vaccines can be given at least two months following primary or booster vaccination.While Moderna’s Omicron booster is authorized for adults aged 18 years and older, Pfizer/BioNTech’s version is approved for people 12 and older.Story continuesThe EUA was expanded last month to include children as young as five years. Following the EUA expansion, a 10-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for individuals aged between five and 11 years. A 25-µg and 50-µg dose of Moderna’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, respectively.The above FDA authorizations granted to Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are based on clinical studies on their bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccines and pre-clinical data from studies on their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike all previously-approved COVID-19 vaccines, the authorization granted to these booster shots is not supported by data from any human clinical studies demonstrating the vaccine’s effectiveness. Encouraging data reported by these companies will help them support their regulatory filings for these vaccines across different countries.Moderna, Inc. PriceModerna, Inc.

In the study, Lynparza plus J&amp;J’s Zytiga and prednisone or prednisolone reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 34% versus Zytiga alone. Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 24.8 months in the Lynparza plus Zytiga arm versus 16.6 months for Zytiga alone.AstraZeneca stock has risen 9.7% this year so far compared with an increase of 2.9% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA supplemental new drug application (sNDA) seeking approval of Lynparza with Zytiga and prednisone or prednisolone is under priority review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.At present, for prostate cancer, Lynparza is approved for BRCA-mutated mCRPC indication in several countries, including the United States and European Union, based on data from the PROfound phase III study.AstraZeneca markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck. The profit-sharing deal between AstraZeneca and Merck was inked in 2017. In addition to Lynparza, the deal included Koselugo.AstraZeneca &amp; Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, namely ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indications as well as some other cancer types.Story continuesThe CHMP also recommended approving AstraZeneca and partner Daiichi Sankyo’s Enhertu for patients with previously treated HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer for patients who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen. The approval for this expanded use of Enhertu was based on data from the DESTINY-Gastric02 and the DESTINY-Gastric01 phase III studiesIn the United States, Enhertu was approved for advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric cancer in January 2021. In the United States, Enhertu is also approved for previously treated HER2-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers.In Europe, Enhertu is presently approved for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in patients who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens.The CHMP also recommended the approval of Imfinzi plus chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) based on the TOPAZ-1 phase III study. Updated survival data from the study showed that Imfinzi plus chemotherapy led to a 24% reduction in the risk of death versus chemotherapy alone. BTC is a group of rare and aggressive cancers that occur in the bile ducts and gallbladder.In the United States, Imfinzi plus chemotherapy was approved for treating locally advanced or metastatic BTC in September.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderAstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

330,b7f64471-666d-346f-a4bd-17bfb1c1e983,KO,2022-11-16,Are Investors Undervaluing The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) By 25%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-coca-cola-company-120145446.html,1668600105,STORY,['KO'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.3bUS$11.0bUS$11.2bUS$13.7bUS$14.7bUS$15.5bUS$16.2bUS$16.8bUS$17.3bUS$17.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.95%Est @ 5.46%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$9.7kUS$9.8kUS$9.4kUS$10.8kUS$10.9kUS$10.9kUS$10.7kUS$10.5kUS$10.2kUS$9.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$103bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$442bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$442b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$245bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$348b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$60.6, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Coca-Cola, we've compiled three relevant items you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Coca-Cola , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for KO's future outlook?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into. Amid a volatile stock market environment, investors are turning towards insiders, billionaires, and famous money managers, in order to replicate their trades or get an idea about the near-term outlook based on their market moves. With Q3 earnings season coming to a close and several mega-cap stocks down meaningfully year-to-date, there is a chance for insiders to extend a vote of confidence by buying up their own company shares.Investors giving up on stocks because of recession fears amid an uncertain market backdrop may want to reconsider their actions, as insiders at prominent companies like The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) are going on buying sprees. It is also a good idea to observe billionaire money managers like Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which controls a $20 billion stock portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. In an interview with Barron’s on November 11, Dalio explained his outlook on the economy in the following words: “When the next big downturn occurs, and the economic pain is greater than the inflation pain, you will see the Fed and other central banks continue money-printing to monetize debt. Then, real rates will go down again, money will become cheaper and more plentiful, and inflation-hedge assets and new innovation/technology-company equities will be most attractive.”Our Methodology We used Ray Dalio’s hedge fund Q3 2022 portfolio for this analysis, selecting his largest stock positions which have also had an insider purchase in the last 6 months. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling IntoStocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into10.

Same Store sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”8. CME Group Inc.

(NASDAQ:CME) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“CME Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) operates the world’s largest and most diversified derivatives marketplace. Shares rose 4.6%, contributing to results as elevated market volatility and rising interest rates led to higher trading activity on CME’s exchanges. Average daily trading volume increased 19% year-over-year with notable strength in Interest Rates and Equities products. We continue to own the stock due to CME’s strong competitive moats, underpinned by its product breadth and liquidity depth, as well as its sustainable growth characteristics driven by the secular shift from uncleared over-the-counter trading to exchange-traded futures while also benefiting from the rising rate environment.”7. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates owns 11.4 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $642.3 million and representing 3.25% of the total portfolio.

Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the re-franchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social media for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”6.

It has a strong market presence in highly attractive geographies with growing populations and low unemployment, such as Texas and Florida, which leads to a favorable payor mix. We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Investment Companies in the WorldBiggest ESG Companies in the WorldBiggest LPG Shipping Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 10 Stocks Ray Dalio and Insiders Are Piling Into is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

According to The Recycling Partnership, currently, only 1.9% of U.S. households1 have access to curbside plastic film recycling, which is the plastic material with the lowest overall recycling rate. Once operating at full capacity, this program is expected to help WM divert more than 120,000 metric tons (MT) of plastics film from landfills annually.(PRNewsfoto/Waste Management National Services, Inc)This effort combines WM's broad reach as a comprehensive environmental solutions provider with Dow's leadership in material science to build new infrastructure that is intended to help close existing recycling gaps, driving a more circular value chain in the U.S. for plastic materials. The initiative has kicked off with an initial pilot program in the Chicago-area community of Hickory Hills, Ill., reaching approximately 3,500 households, with more cities to follow across the country. Consumers in the program's pilot cities will be able to recycle film plastics like bread bags, cling wrap, and dry-cleaning bags directly in their curbside recycling.""By providing residential customers with a simple, curbside option for recycling plastic films, we will not only help our customers more easily manage their used plastic film products, but also meet the rising demand for recycled content products,"" said Jim Fish, president and CEO, WM. ""We recognize that to continue to meet and exceed our sustainability goals, we need to continue to expand our circularity solutions. We see tremendous untapped potential to recycle and reuse plastic film, which many of our residential customers struggle to properly dispose.""WM expects to invest over $800 million through 2025 to improve and enhance recycling infrastructure, including specialized technology that will allow WM to sort plastic films. WM will lead the collection and processing for the film recycling pilots and continue to identify film recycling opportunities across the U.S. By 2025, film recycling through WM is expected to reach 8% of U.S. households.Story continuesDow is supporting this initiative by incorporating recycled content into its product solutions, in line with the company's ambitious, updated Transform the Waste sustainability commitment to deliver 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions by 2030. Through material science expertise, offtakes, cart donations, technology and circular investments, Dow is working to increase recovery rates and drive towards a circular ecosystem for hard-to-recycle plastics.""Enabling a circular economy requires broad stakeholder collaboration, innovation and investment throughout the value chain to continue to more rapidly develop and advance solutions at scale,"" said Jim Fitterling, Dow chairman and CEO. ""Through our collaboration with WM, we're determined to launch new programs that grow recycling infrastructure and access nationwide, creating a more comprehensive system where films and flexible plastics form a key pillar of our circular product offerings.""""As an elected official and resident of Hickory Hills I am honored the City of Hickory Hills was chosen to participate in this new plastic film recycling program. The City of Hickory Hills is extremely excited to be a part of this latest recycling initiative,"" said D'Lorah Catizone, City Clerk for the City of Hickory Hills. ""I think the things everyone can do are small things, but if they are done, it will eventually help the environment. I think recycling is the biggest effort we are making.""This collaboration builds on WM and Dow's continued support for a more expansive recycling system across the country. Earlier this year, WM announced its agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Avangard Innovative's U.S. post-consumer resin (or ""PCR"") business, creating Natura PCR – an independent company expected to scale and grow recycling capacity to produce an estimated 400 million pounds per year of PCR pellets in five years. Natura PCR is expected to provide circular solutions for films and clear plastic wrap used commercially, such as plastic stretch wrap for pallets, furniture film, grocery bags and potentially shrink wrap around food and beverage containers. Dow will continue to grow its REVOLOOP™ PCR product line while also increasing circular ecosystem projects with WM. Together, these projects will increase the recycling rate of plastics and create sustainable solutions in packaging, infrastructure and consumer applications.ABOUT WMWM (WM.com) is North America's largest comprehensive waste management environmental solutions provider.

The survey reveals that shopping local could make or break the holiday season for small business retailers, with 72 per cent of Canadian small businesses saying the 2022 holiday season is more important to their overall financial health compared to last year. However, holiday spending with Canadian small businesses could hit up to $10 billion if Canadian consumers shop small.The results of the new Intuit QuickBooks Holiday Shopping Survey, which surveyed 1,700 Canadian consumers and 700 Canadian small businesses, also highlight how fragile consumer confidence and demand for competitive pricing could spoil the holiday season for retailers. If the economy worsens this year, 84 per cent of Canadian consumers plan to reduce their holiday spending. This comes at a time when inflation is making consumers more price-sensitive, with 67 per cent of consumers planning to buy fewer gifts for friends and family to mitigate financial impact.Small businesses have faced a tough year, with increased shipping costs, supply chain issues, and labour shortages. To help encourage consumers to support local retailers, and help small businesses meet their holiday sales, QuickBooks created a Canada-wide Small Business Holiday Gift Guide.""The holidays are vital to many Canadian small businesses, as the season can drive up to 65 per cent of their annual revenue,"" said David Marquis, vice president and Canada country manager at Intuit. ""Our findings show consumers love the quality and service they receive from small businesses, and more than 8 in 10 consumers plan to maintain or increase spending at small businesses when crossing items off their shopping list. This time of year presents an incredible opportunity for small businesses to meet consumers’ needs and take full advantage of the biggest shopping season of the year.""Story continuesWhat Canadian consumers are wishing for this seasonWhen it comes to what Canadians are looking for this year, QuickBooks made a list – and checked it twice – of a few key consumer habits for small businesses to watch:Online expectations are high: More than seven out of 10 consumers want small businesses to make it easy for them to buy online this holiday season. They will spend more money at small businesses with guaranteed deliveries and returns, quick and easy checkouts, and price-match guarantees.In-store purchases still matter: 52 per cent of consumers say they will spend even more money at small businesses in-person that offer holiday promotions and discounts.Social media shopping carts: One of the top sources consumers are purchasing small business products from is through social media marketplaces (36 per cent currently buy this way).The most wonderful (shopping) time of the year: While September, October, and November are when the majority of consumers are doing holiday shopping, Black Friday remains the most popular shopping day among Canadians. Start marketing and advertising now to make the most of the peak shopping period.How small businesses can unwrap success this seasonThis year, Canadians are seeking a simple and seamless experience when buying online for loved ones with quick and easy checkouts, guaranteed deliveries and returns, as well as up-to-date inventories all top of mind. As holiday shoppers finalize their lists, they’re turning to small businesses as the go-to destination to secure the perfect, unique holiday gift. Small business owners can unwrap success by equipping their business with the right tools and resources. The QuickBooks Holiday Hub offers expert advice and step-by-step guides on effective marketing strategies, managing employees, and more that small businesses need in order to prepare for the busy season and make holiday shopping merry and bright.About the studyIntuit QuickBooks commissioned online surveys, completed in September 2022, of 12,700 respondents in Canada, the US, and UK, comprising 9,700 consumers (adults aged 18+) and 3,000 small businesses (up to 100 employees). In Canada, there were 2,400 respondents: 1,700 adults and 700 small businesses. Census data weightings were used to ensure the responses are as representative as possible. The small business sample excludes businesses that do not consider the holiday season to be important to their overall annual performance. The majority of the small businesses are product-based (60%) with an average annual revenues of $912,000. The average number of employees per business is 27 in Canada. Percentages have been rounded to the nearest decimal place and responses were collected in online surveys using Pollfish audience pools and partner networks with double opt-ins, random device engagement sampling, and post-stratification to ensure accurate targeting and results.

Its COVID-19 vaccine together with the oral antiviral pill for COVID-19, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022. Pfizer boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth.Nevertheless, according to the Zacks analyst estimate Pfizer’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 30% over the next three years.

Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other one. The company continues to expand organically and bolster its digital consumer banking platform.Other than business diversification, robust client engagement, a solid position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), and a decent investment banking (IB) backlog are likely to aid in navigating weaker markets. Also, its robust liquidity position will help sustain capital deployments.(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here &gt;&gt;&gt;)General Electric’ shares have declined -17.0% over the past year against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry’s decline of -18.2%. The company supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs are weighing on the company’s performance. Weakness in the Power and Renewable energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.Foreign currency headwinds are hurting the company’s top line. The company’s strong performance of the Aerospace and Healthcare segments is driving General Electric’s growth. Its investments in productivity and innovation should fuel growth going forward.Cost-control measures and pricing actions are aiding its bottom line. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders are encouraging.

Insiders might have been better off holding onto their shares, given that the average selling price of US$116 is still below the current share price.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Progressive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ProgressiveIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, sold US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$126 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$123. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Progressive didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Progressive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Progressive. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan sold US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$226m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Progressive Insiders?An insider sold Progressive shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Progressive and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

342,48652253-3e94-311c-b1ae-dfc79ceb6e39,VLO,2022-11-16,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-valero-energy-140002012.html,1668520802,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +18.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +10.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has gained 12.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $7.75 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +213.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +22.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $28.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +919.9%. This estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.74 indicates a change of -27.6% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +14.6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $40.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $174.77 billion and $144.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +53.3% and -17.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A look at some of the other stories we're watching in business and beyond. A block on President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan. It's been extended by a US appeals court. This as a lawsuit filed by six states continues to progress.The states, led by conservative lawmakers and legal groups, argue that Biden's forgiveness action exceeds the president's authority, but have encountered difficulties proving they were harmed by the action to have grounds to sue. The plan would have forgiven about $430 billion worth of the $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt in the US. That's according to the Congressional Budget Office.A final touch-up. Beauty specialist Estee Lauder is close to finalizing a deal to buy Tom Ford. That according to the Wall Street Journal. The deal could see Estee Lauder expanding into clothing and accessories, putting it in competition with more diversified fashion houses like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH. A potential acquisition would build on an existing licensing deal in which Estee Lauder produces beauty products for Tom Ford. While there's still no price tag on the deal, the Journal estimates it could be worth about $3 billion.And finally, big shoes to fill. A pair of Birkenstock sandals that graced the feet of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, they've just been sold at auction. The buyer, who is undisclosed, paid over $218,000 for the footwear, which auction house Julien's says is the highest paid for a pair of sandals.Steve Jobs reportedly wore the sandals during key moments in Apple's history, including when helping found the company in a California garage.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 5 Small-Cap Stocks. According to Royce Investment Partners, although equity prices declined in the volatile market environment through the first half of 2022, the third quarter saw a solid yet temporary rally. However, unlike their large-cap counterparts, small-cap stocks did not reach a record low in Q3 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index was down 2.2%, ahead of the large-cap Russell 1000 Index, which was down 4.6% over the same period. Similarly, while the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index dropped 8.4% in Q3 2022, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Large Cap Index plummeted 9.9%. While markets have plunged in response to skyrocketing inflation and interest rates, a steeper decline is yet to emerge, as per Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. The Federal Reserve has lifted rates by 3.75% over the last year. To avoid a “significant stagflation environment,” Dalio observed that the central bank would need to find a balance between inflation and interest rates. Ray Dalio believes that the United States is already facing a trade war, a technology war, a geopolitical war, and an economic war. He also sees a military war as a possibility in the near future. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). However, in this turbulent market backdrop, paired with the outperformance of small-cap stocks, it is a good idea to check out billionaire Ray Dalio’s top small-cap picks. Our Methodology We selected the top 10 small-cap stocks from the Bridgewater portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesRay Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 10 Small-Cap StocksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesRay Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top Small-Cap Stocks10.

(NASDAQ:OMCL) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.00, beating market estimates by $0.05. The revenue of $348.06 million climbed 17.4% year-over-year, but fell short of Wall Street consensus by $15.12 million. For full-year 2022, the company expects total GAAP and non-GAAP revenues to be between $1.284 billion and $1.294 billion, versus the prior guidance of $1.385 billion and $1.410 billion. The consensus revenue estimate came in at $1.40 billion. Craig-Hallum analyst Matt Hewitt on November 3 maintained a Buy rating on Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $75 from $185. While Q3 results and guidance disappointed, the analyst said that he has seen this before and expects the business to rebound.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 19 hedge funds were long Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL), compared to 27 funds in the preceding quarter. The collective stakes in Q2 stood at $103.8 million, compared to $137.5 million in the prior quarter. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc.

The company develops and sells maintenance products, as well as homecare and cleaning products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the Asia Pacific. Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ray Dalio owns 37,771 shares of WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), worth $6.6 million and representing 0.03% of the total holdings. On October 19, WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $1.08, and a revenue of $130.42 million, up 13.2% on a year-over-year basis.

Given that she thinks the company should see double-digit pricing in FY23, the Street's sales growth estimate of 5%-7% ""looks conservative,"" noted the analyst, who also thinks the company should return to a 55% gross margin ""sometime in FY23.""According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 14 hedge funds were bullish on WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), compared to 15 funds in the prior quarter. Here is what Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Fund has to say about WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“WD-40 Company was a top contributor during the quarter. WD40’s primary product is the near-ubiquitous blue and yellow can of lubricant found in households around the world. WD-40 was one of the fortunate businesses that saw a substantial increase in demand for its product during the pandemic. The company is dubbing the phenomenon as ‘isolation renovation’ which reflects the increase in DIY and home improvement projects done while people were stuck at home. Not surprisingly, the company saw growth in the most recent quarter with outsized growth in its ecommerce channel. However, because the average DIY user only needs to replace the product every few years, we were concerned about a pull-forward in demand that might lead to slower growth going forward. We have exited our position to reinvest client capital in potential higher-return opportunities, as detailed below.”8. TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $6,718,000TreeHouse Foods, Inc.

Revenue for the period climbed 16.4% year-over-year to $875 million. The company expects Q4 net sales growth of 22% to 24% year-over-year, versus a 22.61% consensus. It is one of the top small-cap stocks in Ray Dalio's portfolio. Truist analyst Bill Chappell on August 9 raised the price target on TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) to $60 from $50 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, citing the company's better than expected Q2 results. The analyst expects the company to benefit from the consumer shift towards private labels in the second half of the year and into 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 20 hedge funds were long TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) at the end of Q2 2022, with combined stakes worth $293.2 million, compared to 21 funds in the prior quarter worth $207.3 million. Here is what FPA Queens Road has to say about TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS), a manufacturer and distributor of private label food, announced in November 2021 a plan to explore strategic alternatives. The company has been under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners. The company has resisted a sale of the entire business but continues to look for strategic divestitures. While the company appears reasonably valued, we are concerned about its long-term outlook and have reduced our holdings.”7. Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $8,398,000Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) is a Virginia-based healthcare company that provides clinical and administrative solutions to patients and healthcare providers in the United States. Ray Dalio, as of Q3 2022, owns 158,369 shares of Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) worth $8.4 million, representing 0.03% of the total securities. On November 2, Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.59, beating market estimates by $0.49. The revenue of $352.6 million climbed 58.5% year-over-year, missing Wall Street consensus by $4.18 million. For Q4 2022, revenue is expected to be in the range of approximately $361 million to $381 million versus a consensus of $376.16 million.Piper Sandler analyst Jessica Tassan on November 4 maintained an Overweight rating on Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) but lowered the price target on the shares to $33 from $40. The company announced three new partnerships and reported strong Q3 results, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 33 funds in the prior quarter. Glenn W. Welling’s Engaged Capital held the largest stake in the company, with 6.15 million shares worth $189 million. Here is what Alger Capital specifically said about Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) in its second quarter investor letter:“Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) is a health care delivery and payment services company that supports health systems and physician organizations (providers) and health plans (payers) as these clients move their business models from traditional fee-for-service (FFS) to value-based care. The company’s clinical and administrative solutions seek to help customers manage and administer patient care in a more cost-effective manner. Evolent Health targets mid-teen sales growth over the long-term, with a goal to reach mid-teens earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin by 2024.We believe Evolent’s strong second quarter stock performance is attributable to its positive first quarter 2022 earnings report, where Evolent exceeded many analysts’ expectations and raised its fiscal year 2022 outlook. Total lives, or individuals enrolled across all the platforms that Evolent offers, grew 74% year-over-year, driven by both the addition of new lives to the company’s platform and upselling to higher-priced offerings. Evolent also announced two new health plan or provider partnerships in the first quarter, bringing its year-to-date new partnerships to six. Evolent has historically targeted four to six new partnerships per year.We also believe Evolent shares outperformed relative to health care services peers in the current market environment because, unlike many names in its peer set, it is already profitable and generates positive free cash flow.”6. Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $9,897,000Mr. Cooper Group Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) is one of the top stocks from the Bridgewater portfolio. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital specifically said about Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were mortgage servicing company Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) and WESCO International, a leading distributor of electrical, industrial and communications materials and provider of supply chain management and logistics services. Rapidly rising interest rates in Q2 pushed mortgage rates higher, raising concerns about headwinds for the mortgage industry. Unlike peers, Mr. Cooper has a more balanced business model between mortgage origination and servicing, which should help its business from a fundamental perspective in this environment.” Click to continue reading and see Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 5 Small-Cap Stocks.  Suggested articles:12 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy12 Best Construction Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

Horton's (NYSE:DHI) Shareholders Will Receive A Bigger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-hortons-nyse-dhi-114930665.html,1668599370,STORY,['DHI'],"[The board of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.25 on the 12th of December, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.2%. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton D.R. Horton's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. But before making this announcement, D.R. Horton's earnings quite easily covered the dividend. The business is earning enough to make the dividend feasible, but the cash payout ratio of 83% shows that most of the cash is going back to the shareholders, which could constrain growth prospects going forward.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 38.3% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 10%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendD.R. Horton Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.15 total annually to $1.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that D.R. Horton has grown earnings per share at 44% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Our Thoughts On D.R. Horton's DividendIn summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. On the plus side, the dividend looks sustainable by most measures but it is let down by the lack of cash flows. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for D.R.

The equity already carries a 27.9% year-over-year deficit, and is now eyeing its third-straight daily drop. What's more, AAL could continue careening towards its Oct. 3, two-year low of $11.65, after running into a historically bearish trendline. Digging deeper, American Airlines stock currently sits within one standard deviation of its 160-day moving average. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's most recent study, AAL has seen six similar signals in the last three years, and was lower one month later 83% of the time, averaging an 11.3% dip. A move of similar magnitude would place the security back below the $13.20 level, which contained two of its latest pullbacks. AAL 160 DayAnalysts are still on the fence, indicating a round of downgrades and/or price-target cuts could push American Airlines stock lower. Of the 13 analysts in question, 10 still call AAL a tepid ""hold.""Now looks like an ideal time to jump in on the bearish bandwagon.

Given the nature of the climate challenge and of our industry, transitioning to low- and no-carbon aviation depends on innovations in airframe, engine and fuel technologies, combined with effective policies that drive those innovations and the necessary investments to bring them to scale. American is committed to collaborating across the public and private sectors to help advance the policy and technology solutions needed to get to net zero.One way we are doing that is as an anchor partner of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst (Catalyst), a groundbreaking program within the larger Breakthrough Energy network that is working to accelerate the development and commercialization of critical technologies for decarbonization. Catalyst's initial focus is on SAF, green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage and direct air capture. It is bringing together partners from across the public and private sectors, using a creative, blended financing approach that combines philanthropic, belowmarket and low-cost capital to make targeted investments to scale and reduce the ""green premium"" of new decarbonization technologies. American has committed to invest $100 million in the effort. Catalyst also brings together experts to develop policy recommendations for accelerating innovation and encouraging the widespread adoption of clean technologies.Climate technologies moving out of the lab and into the market often struggle to access capital due to higher risk, lower demand and lesser returns than exist for more mature solutions. Catalyst helps finance first-of-their-kind projects that deploy these innovative climate technologies, with the aim of reducing risks, driving down costs and creating a smoother pathway to widespread market adoption.Story continuesRead moreView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/726039/Collaborating-on-Climate-Related-Technology-and-Policy-Solutions]"
361,bbfd13f3-14b1-3983-b116-22eb851b1eec,PFG,2022-11-16,Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.64,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-group-nasdaq-pfg-112317492.html,1668597797,STORY,['PFG'],"[The board of Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.64 per share on the 19th of December. This makes the dividend yield 2.7%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, Principal Financial Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 62.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 34%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.72 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.56. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Principal Financial Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 28% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Principal Financial Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

However, a new U.S.-focused analysis of the Index, sponsored by Principal Financial Group® and conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr), reveals an opportunity for employers to provide greater financial inclusion and support for their employees.The Index ranks 42 global markets on three pillars of financial inclusion - government, financial system, and employer support - using data across public and survey-based sources. The analysis ranked the U.S. first out of the 42 markets in the financial system pillar and second within the employer support pillar, driven largely by its enablement of small and medium enterprise (SME) growth and success.""U.S. employers are critical in helping their employees access the resources necessary to make well-informed financial decisions,"" said Chris Littlefield, president of Retirement and Income Solutions at Principal®. ""We must recognize and appreciate the role employers play in fostering financial inclusion within our communities and, as an industry, continue to do everything we can to help more businesses support the financial needs of their employees, now and into the future.""Opportunity for more consistent employer support across industriesWhen analyzing U.S. employer data by industry, opportunities were identified to enable more access to financial resources such as guidance, insurance benefits, retirement contributions, and pay initiatives (i.e. method of payment, access to interest-free loans on salary, etc.).Across six broad industry classifications within the U.S., professional sectors with typically higher wages (i.e. finance, insurance, real estate, and information management) were found to provide employees with more consistent support and tools to enable financial inclusion. This can generally be compared to industries such as retail and hospitality that often employ more informal workers and tend to have lower wages.Story continues""The importance of this analysis is the insight it offers employers to know where they stand in comparison to their industry and to consider how they can best support their employees with access to savings, financial education, and financial well-being programs,"" Littlefield said.

Specifically, large businesses score considerably higher than small businesses on the level of support they offer to the workforce via financial guidance, insurance, pension contributions, and pay initiatives, for example.There are various reasons why large businesses can provide greater support than small businesses, who may lack dedicated resources and tend to overestimate the cost of benefits6. Small businesses could benefit from additional support in offering these solutions to their employees, whether from the government or through the financial services system at large.""There's a need to better equip small businesses with the right information and tools to enable greater financial security for their employees,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of U.S. Insurance Solutions at Principal.

363,82d98aa9-57f4-37e8-9654-ebbafbd14574,AFL,2022-11-16,Employee burnout is on par with levels at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; job performance impacted,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/employee-burnout-par-levels-height-130700415.html,1668604020,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac study reveals enduring stress and anxiety are affecting U.S. workforce mental health and productivityCOLUMBUS, Ga., Nov. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Due to continued COVID-19 concerns, a sluggish economy and the fear of a potential recession, there is a critical need for mental health care and resources to support employees, according to the nationally representative 12th annual Aflac WorkForces Report. The study — released by Aflac Incorporated, a leading provider of supplemental health insurance and products in the U.S. — captures trends and attitudes about the state of workplace benefits.According to the newly released report, more than half (59%) of American workers are experiencing at least moderate levels of burnout, a notable increase over 2021 (52%) and on par with the levels reported in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report.Mental health and well-being rise to the topThe study uncovers the enduring effect of stress and uncertainty on Americans, making mental health care a big priority for employers. Stress is not only impacting American workers' home lives, but also their work lives and, consequently, productivity. The survey found that employees are asking for mental health care in higher numbers than ever before, and employers are searching for new ways to provide it. Key statistics:Mental health negatively affected job performances of nearly half (46%) of the U.S. workforce in the past year — a significant increase over 2021 (34%).More than half (51%) of employers recognize that employee mental health issues have affected their businesses over the past year.Nearly 80% of employees state that mental health coverage is critical, yet only 61% have access to mental health care as part of their benefits package.Burnout has a detrimental impact on U.S. workforceSurvey responses show that burnout is associated with job satisfaction and loyalty. Employees who suffer from high levels of burnout report lower job satisfaction (55%), lower confidence that their employers care about them (47%), negative perceptions of work-life balance (55%) and a higher likelihood of seeking another job in the next year (56%). According to the report:Story continuesThe most financially concerned populations — Gen Z (71%), those working multiple jobs (66%), Hispanics (65%), those working multiple jobs (66%), millennials (65%) and women (62%) — are seriously affected by burnout.Yet 45% of employers are no more likely this year than last (43%) to view burnout as a problem for their organization.Over half (56%) of employees believe that their organizations care about their well-being at least a moderate amount. This sentiment is strongest among those with a hybrid working arrangement (70%).""A major concern of employee burnout is the impact on their well-being and how it affects engagement and retention,"" said Matthew Owenby, chief human resources officer, Aflac Incorporated. ""Employers are looking for new ways to offer benefits that help improve their employees' mental health balance. At Aflac, we help support our customers with access to mental health benefits, which is available through our individual short–term disability and group critical illness products.""2Employees and employers have differing views on financial stabilityAccording to the survey, many American workers are struggling financially, and even more are vulnerable to unexpected medical costs not covered by health insurance. While employers have always lagged in understanding the financial instability facing the workforce, this year, the gap is wider than ever.More than half (58%) of Americans say they could not pay $1,000 in out-of-pocket costs. This is most concerning for Gen Z (78%), African Americans (72%) and Hispanics (65%).About 3 out of 5 (57%) workers report suffering high levels of anxiety about health care costs exceeding what their insurance covers. This is most prevalent among Hispanics (69%), including both Gen Z and millennials (65%).Three-quarters (76%) of employers think their employees understand their health care costs well, while just 52% of employees agree.About 57% of employees are confident they will be very well covered in the event of a serious illness, and only 1 in 5 believe they will be covered extremely well.Hispanic (46%) — including both Gen Z and millennial (44%) — workers are the most impacted by inflation with nearly half indicating that rising costs have affected their ability to afford a medical treatment or prescription.""Soaring health care costs, lack of understanding of benefits on health insurance policies and the economic downturn have contributed to employees' anxiety about their insurance coverage,"" said Owenby. ""Hispanics and younger workers have been hard-hit by inflation with nearly half indicating that rising costs have driven them to choose between paying medical or other bills.""Supplemental insurance can help provide an additional layer of financial protectionAbout half (48%) of American employees view supplemental benefits as a core component of a comprehensive benefits program.Nine out of 10 employees believe the need for supplemental insurance like dental, life and vision is increasing.Nearly 77% of employers who offer supplemental insurance believe these benefits help with recruitment, and 80% say they help with retention.The COVID-19 pandemic brought about sweeping changes to the workplace, the workforce, and benefits enrollment and management, while also spurring a period of innovation in the benefits space. However, even with advancements in key areas such a telemedicine and other online resources, employees made it clear in 2022 that they value the human side of their benefits packages just as much. Offering robust mental health resources, flexible work schedules, and one-on-one support rise to the top this year as ways for employers to attract and retain top talent in today's competitive work environment.To learn more, read the 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report at AflacWorkForcesReport.com.About the 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces ReportThe 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report, conducted by Kantar on behalf of Aflac, is the 12th annual study examining benefits trends, attitudes and use of employee benefits in the U.S. workforce in various industries and business sizes.

Moreover, the figure increased 1.7% year over year.Its results were aided by a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. This retail REIT behemoth also raised its 2022 comparable FFO per share outlook from $11.70-$11.77 to $11.83-$11.88.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased marginally upward over the past week.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us now decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price.Improving Leasing Environment: The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. As a result, Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad has been experiencing solid leasing activity.For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, it signed 983 new leases and 1,116 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.Healthy Operating Performance: The occupancy for Simon Property’s U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio improved 170 basis points year over year to 94.5% as of Sep 30, 2022. Also, the base-minimum rent per square foot for this portfolio was $54.80 as of Sep 30, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Sep 30, 2021.   During the third quarter, the retailer sales touched another record high of $749 per square foot for the malls and the outlets combined. This reflected an increase of 14% year-over-year.Focus on Omni-Chanel Strategy: Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omni-channel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, has enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: The company maintains a solid balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited third-quarter 2022 with $8.6 billion of liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 5.0, which is well ahead of the required level. SPG also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.SPG’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 54.59% compared with the industry’s average of 6.27%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.In addition, its current cash flow growth is projected at 44.90% compared with the 26.69% growth estimated for the industry.With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Dividends: Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and SPG has consistently raised its dividend rates. Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings release on Nov 1, 2022, SPG announced a 2.9% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.80 per share. Prior to this, the company increased its third-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.75 per share from $1.70 paid earlier. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers, affecting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores. Also, interest rate hikes add to its concerns.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and American Assets Trust AAT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 5 Small-Cap Stocks. According to Royce Investment Partners, although equity prices declined in the volatile market environment through the first half of 2022, the third quarter saw a solid yet temporary rally. However, unlike their large-cap counterparts, small-cap stocks did not reach a record low in Q3 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index was down 2.2%, ahead of the large-cap Russell 1000 Index, which was down 4.6% over the same period. Similarly, while the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index dropped 8.4% in Q3 2022, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Large Cap Index plummeted 9.9%. While markets have plunged in response to skyrocketing inflation and interest rates, a steeper decline is yet to emerge, as per Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. The Federal Reserve has lifted rates by 3.75% over the last year. To avoid a “significant stagflation environment,” Dalio observed that the central bank would need to find a balance between inflation and interest rates. Ray Dalio believes that the United States is already facing a trade war, a technology war, a geopolitical war, and an economic war. He also sees a military war as a possibility in the near future. Some of the premier holdings of the Bridgewater portfolio include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). However, in this turbulent market backdrop, paired with the outperformance of small-cap stocks, it is a good idea to check out billionaire Ray Dalio’s top small-cap picks. Our Methodology We selected the top 10 small-cap stocks from the Bridgewater portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Story continuesRay Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 10 Small-Cap StocksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesRay Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top Small-Cap Stocks10.

(NASDAQ:OMCL) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.00, beating market estimates by $0.05. The revenue of $348.06 million climbed 17.4% year-over-year, but fell short of Wall Street consensus by $15.12 million. For full-year 2022, the company expects total GAAP and non-GAAP revenues to be between $1.284 billion and $1.294 billion, versus the prior guidance of $1.385 billion and $1.410 billion. The consensus revenue estimate came in at $1.40 billion. Craig-Hallum analyst Matt Hewitt on November 3 maintained a Buy rating on Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $75 from $185. While Q3 results and guidance disappointed, the analyst said that he has seen this before and expects the business to rebound.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 19 hedge funds were long Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL), compared to 27 funds in the preceding quarter. The collective stakes in Q2 stood at $103.8 million, compared to $137.5 million in the prior quarter. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Omnicell, Inc.

The company develops and sells maintenance products, as well as homecare and cleaning products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the Asia Pacific. Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ray Dalio owns 37,771 shares of WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), worth $6.6 million and representing 0.03% of the total holdings. On October 19, WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $1.08, and a revenue of $130.42 million, up 13.2% on a year-over-year basis.

Given that she thinks the company should see double-digit pricing in FY23, the Street's sales growth estimate of 5%-7% ""looks conservative,"" noted the analyst, who also thinks the company should return to a 55% gross margin ""sometime in FY23.""According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 14 hedge funds were bullish on WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), compared to 15 funds in the prior quarter. Here is what Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Fund has to say about WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“WD-40 Company was a top contributor during the quarter. WD40’s primary product is the near-ubiquitous blue and yellow can of lubricant found in households around the world. WD-40 was one of the fortunate businesses that saw a substantial increase in demand for its product during the pandemic. The company is dubbing the phenomenon as ‘isolation renovation’ which reflects the increase in DIY and home improvement projects done while people were stuck at home. Not surprisingly, the company saw growth in the most recent quarter with outsized growth in its ecommerce channel. However, because the average DIY user only needs to replace the product every few years, we were concerned about a pull-forward in demand that might lead to slower growth going forward. We have exited our position to reinvest client capital in potential higher-return opportunities, as detailed below.”8. TreeHouse Foods, Inc.

It is one of the top small-cap stocks in Ray Dalio's portfolio. Truist analyst Bill Chappell on August 9 raised the price target on TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) to $60 from $50 and kept a Buy rating on the shares, citing the company's better than expected Q2 results. The analyst expects the company to benefit from the consumer shift towards private labels in the second half of the year and into 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 20 hedge funds were long TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS) at the end of Q2 2022, with combined stakes worth $293.2 million, compared to 21 funds in the prior quarter worth $207.3 million. Here is what FPA Queens Road has to say about TreeHouse Foods, Inc.

The company has been under pressure from activist investor Jana Partners. The company has resisted a sale of the entire business but continues to look for strategic divestitures.

Ray Dalio, as of Q3 2022, owns 158,369 shares of Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) worth $8.4 million, representing 0.03% of the total securities. On November 2, Evolent Health, Inc.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 33 funds in the prior quarter. Glenn W. Welling’s Engaged Capital held the largest stake in the company, with 6.15 million shares worth $189 million. Here is what Alger Capital specifically said about Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) in its second quarter investor letter:“Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:EVH) is a health care delivery and payment services company that supports health systems and physician organizations (providers) and health plans (payers) as these clients move their business models from traditional fee-for-service (FFS) to value-based care. The company’s clinical and administrative solutions seek to help customers manage and administer patient care in a more cost-effective manner. Evolent Health targets mid-teen sales growth over the long-term, with a goal to reach mid-teens earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin by 2024.We believe Evolent’s strong second quarter stock performance is attributable to its positive first quarter 2022 earnings report, where Evolent exceeded many analysts’ expectations and raised its fiscal year 2022 outlook. Total lives, or individuals enrolled across all the platforms that Evolent offers, grew 74% year-over-year, driven by both the addition of new lives to the company’s platform and upselling to higher-priced offerings. Evolent also announced two new health plan or provider partnerships in the first quarter, bringing its year-to-date new partnerships to six. Evolent has historically targeted four to six new partnerships per year.We also believe Evolent shares outperformed relative to health care services peers in the current market environment because, unlike many names in its peer set, it is already profitable and generates positive free cash flow.”6.

(NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) is one of the top stocks from the Bridgewater portfolio. Here is what Diamond Hill Capital specifically said about Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were mortgage servicing company Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (NASDAQ:COOP) and WESCO International, a leading distributor of electrical, industrial and communications materials and provider of supply chain management and logistics services. Rapidly rising interest rates in Q2 pushed mortgage rates higher, raising concerns about headwinds for the mortgage industry. Unlike peers, Mr. Cooper has a more balanced business model between mortgage origination and servicing, which should help its business from a fundamental perspective in this environment.” Click to continue reading and see Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio Q3 2022: Top 5 Small-Cap Stocks.  Suggested articles:12 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy12 Best Construction Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

Cisco has achieved many bold goals over its 38-year history by relying on smart people, innovation and science.Now that I am Cisco's Chief Sustainability Officer, science has never been more important to me. Scientific evidence shows that climate change is an urgent crisis. If we don't limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5° Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, we will face dramatic consequences, as natural disasters such as floods, more severe and frequent weather events, longer and more severe droughts, and food shortages can be exacerbated by a changing climate. We are already seeing evidence of these events every day in the news.How do we limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C? The world must reach zero greenhouse (GHG) gas emissions by 2050. If that sounds hard, it's because it will be. But the science says it is possible, if we act now and with urgency.That is why one year ago, Cisco set a goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2040. When we set our net zero goal we aimed high. To support our goal, we know we need to innovate with passion and trust science.The science behind achieving net zero and the journey it will take to achieve it are both complex and evolving. But the reason for doing it is simple: our future depends on it.I am pleased to share with you some of the developments around our net zero goal in the last year.Third-party validation and consistent transparencyIn July 2022, Cisco's 2040 net zero goal was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) under its Net-Zero Standard. The SBTi Net-Zero Standard is the world's first framework for corporate net zero target setting in line with climate science.To earn SBTi validation, companies are required to reduce their emissions by at least 90%. This requirement means we can't simply rely on carbon offsets to achieve our goal. Having SBTi validation signals that we are committed to the deep emissions reduction that are needed to reduce global warming.Story continuesNet zero is defined as a state where no incremental greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere. Companies can achieve net zero through a combination of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and neutralizing any remaining GHG emissions by removing (sequestering) an equivalent amount from the atmosphere through offsets. For Cisco, our strategy to help reduce our GHG emissions includes the adoption of renewable energy at customer sites and the adoption of certain Cisco products and services by our customers.Companies with SBTi validation can use offsets for no more than 10% of their emissions reduction. This means that we must focus the bulk of our efforts on deep emissions reductions - which we believe is the best way to reduce global warming and lessen the impacts of climate change.Cisco has a long history of setting and achieving ESG (environmental, social and governance) goals. We published our first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2005, and we continue to report our emissions data annually in our Purpose Report and our ESG Reporting Hub.We do this so that our customers, employees, investors and others can see the great progress we are making on our various ESG initiatives, goals and commitments. We will continue to provide updates in our ESG Reporting Hub and are committed to providing our stakeholders a clear picture of our progress, challenges and learnings.Doing what is good for the worldCisco was responsible for approximately 23 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) across all scopes of emissions in Cisco's fiscal year 2021. That is only approximately 0.06% of total global greenhouse gas emissions (based on 2021 IEA data), but it is still critically important for us to reduce our own emissions as much as possible. In doing so, we can have an even bigger impact by enabling our customers and others to do the same.For example, reducing the energy consumption of our products helps lower Cisco's Scope 3 emissions, but also helps our customers reduce their Scope 2 emissions. If you're not familiar with the scopes of emissions, you can learn about them from this Greenhouse Gas Protocol image, or see our definitions at the bottom of this blog.Increasing the amount of energy generated from renewable sources like wind and solar (""greening the grid"") is another imperative. According to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, ""limiting warming to 2°C or 1.5°C will require substantial energy system changes over the next 30 years. This includes reduced fossil fuel consumption"" and ""increased production from low- and zero-carbon energy sources…""Our products and solutions can help utility companies shift to a more low-carbon model. For example, we have worked with Enel, Italy's largest energy provider, to create a smarter, more energy-efficient power grid. Using Cisco technology, Enel can monitor its energy grid and preemptively address any faults or failures that threaten the network, and more effectively connect to renewable energy sources.And our efforts to increase our own use of renewable energy over the last 15 years can also help to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy systems around the world. How? Because longer-term, multi-year renewable energy agreements provide valuable funding for energy providers, making it more competitive with conventionally produced power, and these agreements help to ensure that renewable energy will be purchased over a certain amount of time.For example, to increase the amount of renewable energy we use in India, we signed two long-term solar power purchase agreements (PPAs) in 2018 that deliver approximately 85,000 megawatt hours of electricity every year to the grid where our Bangalore campus is located.Through our continued investments and leadership, we hope to help accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and encourage other companies to invest in renewables as well.All told, we have a number of multi-year renewable energy PPAs around the world that collectively produce more than 300,000 megawatt hours per year. We are actively pursuing additional PPAs with the intent of increasing the amount of renewable energy we purchase through PPAs and long-term renewable energy agreements over the next few years.Making the journey togetherWe will also continue to co-innovate with our customers, suppliers, partners and others to develop new business models that can dramatically accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We know that technology advances rapidly, and we want to be ready to help capture opportunities. This is a time for thinking big, and we want to share and collaborate like never before. The only way we can help reduce climate change is by working together and more openly sharing practices that are working and not working, so we can learn from each other.While we will dream big, we will still remain grounded in the science. And we will continue to evolve our approach as more mechanisms become available. We will use real data to understand what is really working, what impact we are having, and if there are any unintended consequences. The more we know, the better we can do.Ultimately, it is not just about our net zero goal. We can help build ecofriendly businesses; promote circular business models; maintain and restore the health of our land, oceans, and ecosystems; and create opportunities for people to participate in the green and digital economy. It is about helping to scale climate solutions by investing in them now. You can see an example of this in the Cisco Foundation, and how it has committed to investing $100 million over ten years in promising climate solutions.Setting a net zero goal and naming a Chief Sustainability Officer are important steps forward. But they alone are not enough to reduce the impact of climate change. We still have much more work to do in the years to come, and as our strategy grows and evolves, we are committed to sharing the details - both the accomplishments and the challenges - with you.Visit our ESG Reporting Hub for more details on our environmental initiatives.Scopes of emissionsScope 1: emissions from fuels we buy and burn within our operations. Examples are natural gas used to heat our buildings, back-up generators that run on diesel, and gasoline used in Cisco-owned vehicles.Scope 2: emissions from electricity we buy for our operations. Examples are the power we use in our labs and data centers to power our equipment and keep the lights on.Scope 3: emissions related to our business, but that we don't own or control. Examples are the electricity our products consume after we sell them, our suppliers' energy use, transporting our products, and employees commuting in their personal vehicles.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725905/Net-Zero-One-Year-Later]"
