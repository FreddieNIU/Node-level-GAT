With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 results. Western Digital's second quarter results demonstrate that the structural changes we have put in place over the last few years and the strategy we have been executing are producing significant outperformance across our Flash and HDD businesses. I am confident that building leading products across a broad range of end markets, closely controlling our product costs through focused R&D and manufacturing, and bolstering the agility of our business will allow us to improve through-cycle profitability and dampen business cycles. As a result, we reported revenue of $3 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 15.5% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.69, all of which met or exceeded the non-GAAP guidance ranges we provided in October. Before discussing the business details, I want to provide some comments on the emerging trends we are seeing and how the changes we have made position our Flash and HD (sic) [HDD] businesses to benefit. In flash, we've been able to navigate business cycles by managing inventory proactively, offering a broad range of products, and optimizing capital efficiency through our joint venture partnership with Kioxia. These successful efforts are reflected in our best-in-class gross margin throughout the cycle. During the quarter, our portfolio strategy to dynamically allocate bit shipments drove upside in ASPs and gross margin. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to our supply and capital investments. Consequently, we continue to proactively manage our bit shipments to structurally align our supply and inventory with customer demand and improve through-cycle profitability into the future. In addition to the recovery in both Flash and HDD markets, we believe storage is entering a multiyear growth period. Generative AI has quickly emerged as yet another growth driver and transformative technology that is reshaping all industries, all companies in our daily lives. Importantly, industry analysts estimate that the edge now represents approximately 80% of total NAND bit shipments, an increase from approximately 75% in calendar year 2022, which is another indication that cloud demand was significantly pulled in during the pandemic. In addition, we believe the second wave of generative AI-driven storage deployments will spark a client and consumer device refresh cycle and reaccelerate content growth in PC, smartphone, gaming and consumer in the coming years. Our flash portfolio is extremely well positioned to benefit from this emerging secular tailwind. In HDD, Western Digital's leading ePMR platform and enhanced UltraSMR technology allow us to provide the highest-capacity drives for mass market deployment. We believe this innovative technology and portfolio strategy enable us to offer the best TCO to our cloud customers and outperform our peers throughout the cycle. We are confident that the multi-quarter nearline demand headwinds have subsided as our major cloud customers have reengaged with us. We anticipate our financial outperformance resulting from profitable share gains to become more evident as nearline demand accelerates into the second half of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Moving on to end market commentary. During the quarter, revenue in the cloud end market returned to sequential growth for the first time in 6 quarters. The sequential revenue growth was led by an increase in nearline shipments. In client, sequentially, revenue declined slightly as the increase in flash ASPs was offset by a decline in bit shipments as we proactively optimized product mix. In consumer, the sequential revenue growth was led by seasonal strength in flash bit shipments into retail and an increase in flash ASPs. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with Flash. During the quarter, the sequential revenue increase was due to stronger execution in driving price inflection by optimizing bit shipment across our broad go-to-market channels into the consumer and client end markets, resulting in stronger-than-planned ASP increase. In particular, our WD Black gaming SSD product, which offers high reliability, best-in-class performance, expansive storage capabilities and a hyper-realistic gaming experience, achieved a new record revenue with bit shipment growth of over 50% year-over-year. On the technology front, we remain on track to ramp an array of QLC-based client SSDs, utilizing BiCS6 technology. Our ability to combine this new high-performance node with our in-house controller development allows us to offer a portfolio of client SSDs with unmatched performance and value. We expect these products to lead the transition to QLC flash in calendar year 2024. Additionally, BiCS8 yield is progressing well, and we remain on track to productize this technology. Turning to HDD. The sequential revenue increase was driven by improving nearline demand and pricing. Moreover, we are encouraged by demand in China with revenue doubling on a sequential and year-over-year basis, both of which were ahead of our expectations. We anticipate year-over-year growth in HDD throughout this calendar year. In both the first and second quarters, we shipped approximately 1 million UltraSMR drives per quarter. We forecast UltraSMR hard drive shipments to increase significantly in the fiscal third quarter and SMR drive shipments to continue to outgrow that of CMR drives going forward. Importantly, the adoption of UltraSMR is broadening to our major customers worldwide, including a third cloud titan in the U.S. this year as well as hyperscale and smart video customers in China. We expect to complete the qualifications of our 26-terabyte and 28-terabyte UltraSMR drives at these customers this quarter and throughout the calendar year and forecast SMR to comprise the majority of nearline demand by calendar year 2025. We have strong conviction that our portfolio strategy of first commercializing Western Digital's industry-leading UltraSMR technology, which will be followed by our transition from ePMR to HAMR, offers the best TCO to our customers in both the near and long term, while delivering leading portfolio profitability in the industry. Over the next several years, we will be introducing a number of exciting products, including multiple generations of nearline drives combining ePMR, OptiNAND and UltraSMR technologies in the 30- to upper 30-terabyte capacity range, all of which will be ready for high-volume production to support the explosion of AI training data and content. Before I turn over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspectives on our outlook. In flash, starting with demand in calendar year 2024, we estimate industry bit growth to be around the mid-teens percentage, similar to the growth rate in calendar year 2023. On the supply side, we estimate that fab out bit production growth to remain in the mid-single-digit percentage range. We believe our business agility and our highly capital-efficient and low-cost BiCS architecture have enabled us to align supply with demand via nodal transition much more quickly than our peers. We will continue our disciplined approach to dynamically managing our inventory capacities and capital expenditures to keep our supply aligned with end customer demand. Although flash pricing has started to increase, our profitability and cash generation continue to be well below the level that justify an increase in capital investments. We anticipate wafer equipment spending will remain at historic lows in the near term and flash to be undersupplied for an extended period of time. Overall, we will continue to focus on allocating our bids to the most attractive end markets and anticipate flash ASP increases to be the primary revenue growth driver throughout this calendar year. In HDD, our competitive portfolio strategy has enabled us to consistently achieve profitable share gain in the last 2 calendar years. We are confident that this trend will continue as nearline demand continues to improve and we continue to ramp our UltraSMR-enabled products. Let me now turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our financial second quarter results."", 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Following on David's comments, the success of the strategy we have been executing is reflected in our financial performance. Non-GAAP results in the fiscal second quarter exceeded or were at the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Total revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, up 10% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.69 as strong execution with our broad go-to-market channels benefited flash ASP and gross margin. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, up 23% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth is attributed to higher nearline shipments to data center customers and better nearline pricing. Nearline bit shipments were 67 exabytes, up 23%. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower eSSD bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, HDD cloud revenue increased for the first time in 6 quarters. Client represented 37% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Sequentially, an increase in flash ASP was more than offset by a decline in flash bit shipments. The year-over-year increase was due to higher flash shipments primarily driven by client SSD shipments into PC applications more than offsetting a decline in ASP. Consumer represented 28% of total revenue at $0.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Sequentially, the growth was primarily due to seasonal strength in flash bit shipments. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in flash bit shipments was partially offset by a decline in flash ASP as well as lower HDD shipments. Turning now to revenue by business segment. In the fiscal second quarter, Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, growing 7% sequentially as flash ASPs increased 10% on a blended basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis, stronger than anticipated entering the quarter. Bit shipments decreased 2% after record shipments in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, flash revenue grew slightly with a 21% increase in bit shipments offsetting lower prices. HDD revenue was $1.4 billion, increasing 14% sequentially as total exabyte shipments increased 14% and average price per unit increased 9% to $122. On a year-over-year basis, HDD revenue declined 6%, while total exabyte shipments increased 2% and average price per unit increased 23%. Moving to gross margin and expenses. Please note, my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin was 15.5%, above the guidance range provided in October and improving 11.4 percentage points sequentially while declining 1.9 percentage points year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher flash ASPs as we proactively optimized product mix, which more than offset higher than anticipated underutilization charges of $156 million or a 5.1 percentage points headwind. Flash gross margin was higher than expected at 7.9%, up 18.2 percentage points sequentially and down 6.6 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $107 million or a 6.4 percentage points headwind to gross margin. HDD gross margin was 24.8%, up 1.9 percentage points sequentially and 4.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes underutilization charges of $49 million or a 3.6 percentage point headwind. We continue to tightly manage operating expenses, which were $561 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year and at the lower end of the guidance range. Operating loss in the quarter was $91 million, which included underutilization charges of $156 million. Fiscal second quarter loss per share was $0.69, inclusive of a $14 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred shares. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $92 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $176 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement, represented a cash outflow of $84 million. The quarter ending inventory was $3.2 billion, declining $281 million from the prior quarter. Days of inventory decreased 5 days to 115 days. The majority of the decline was in flash, where flash days of inventory remained at a 4-year low. During the quarter, we issued $1.6 billion in convertible notes, repurchased $508 million of the outstanding 2024 convertible notes and paid down $300 million of the delayed-draw term loan. Gross debt outstanding was $8.5 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. We expect to retire the remaining balance of approximately $600 million of the 2024 convertible notes at maturity in February 2024. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion, and total liquidity was $4.7 billion, including the undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect sequential revenue growth to be mainly driven by an increase in HDD. We anticipate flash revenue to be up slightly as we remain focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP. We expect gross margin to be between 22% and 24%, which includes HDD underutilization charges of $30 million to $40 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million, with the increase driven by the reinstatement of certain incentive compensation programs as the financial outlook has strengthened. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $95 million. We continue to expect income tax expenses to be between $20 million and $30 million for fiscal third quarter and $80 million to $120 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect a preferred dividend of $15 million. We expect earnings per share to be $0.05, plus or minus $0.15, based on approximately 330 million shares outstanding. As the financial outlook has improved, we will remain disciplined in executing the business, proactively managing our supply and inventory to meet customer end demand, and controlling capital spending, all with the goal of improving profitability. I'll now turn the call back over to David."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Thanks, Wissam. Let me wrap up, and then we'll open up for questions. I want to emphasize that the steps the Western Digital team has taken to instill and deploy an industry-leading product portfolio, while also moving quickly to adapt to both volatile market dynamics and anticipate future trends, have enabled us to capitalize on the upswing we see ahead. Through our product leadership and ability to dampen business cycles and improve through-cycle profitability, I am confident we are well positioned to execute on our current strategy, which will reaffirm our strength over the long term. Let's now begin the Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""I wonder if you could talk about the gross margin improvement in Q1. I guess, how do you apportion that between the drive business and the NAND business? And I guess I'm -- I would think with being judicious on volume, you get some pretty good NAND pricing. I guess I might have expected a little bit more gross margin improvement, so just curious what I'm missing there."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes, Joe. So we've been -- it's good to see the pricing inflect. If you look into Q1, we were happy with the gross margin we delivered in the Flash business in the December quarter at 7.9%. I think we were able to capture the turn in the market well. So that gives us a little higher base going into the March quarter. But if you look at the bulk businesses, you see flash will be down on bits and up on price. So we see -- we still see strong price increases quarter-to-quarter, but we're down on volume. Let's call it low double digits. And then in the HDD business, we see increase in volume and increase in price."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.', 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""Yes. Just kind of building off that last question. I know you talked about the hard disk drive underutilization expectation in this current quarter kind of embedded in that 22% to 24% guide. What's the underutilization assumption you're making on the Flash business? And just in general, how do you think about the trajectory of flash gross margin? Let's say, in theory of pricing and your implementation of price increases continues, how do we think about the return to kind of a 30%-plus gross margin in flash? So just trying to think about the puts and takes in the guidance and then the longer term kind of you back to what you'd characterize as normalized gross margin."", 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""Thanks, Aaron. So for flash in our guide, we don't have underutilization for Q3. In fact, we executed ahead of schedule and reached our targeted supply and inventory goals faster than what we anticipated. And so as you know, we continue to dynamically manage supply and inventory to meet our end demand. And so the fab utilization reflects that. If you recall, in our results in Q1, flash inventory was down almost $400 million. Last quarter, we saw another over $200 million decline in inventory. We exited the quarter at levels we haven't seen in a few years. So having said that, obviously, we will continue to be disciplined in how we manage our supply and inventory to meet end customer demand on flash and also, of course, control our capital spend. With respect to your question at the 30%, let me clarify. Was your question the 30% on the Flash or on the HDD side?"", 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""Well, I guess, I'm going to say both, but it was in flash."", 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""Yes, I thought I heard you say flash. I was going to start talking about it. Well, let me start talking about HDD. Look, at HDD, we're pretty much very close to that level. When you look at what we delivered in the second quarter and when you also look at the guide, it does reflect continuous margin improvement on the HDD side. And so I also anticipate that there should be continuous improvement as the recovery continues in that business, so a 30% is very much within reach. And we should be able to achieve it pretty soon. On the flash side, the -- a lot has to do with continuing to optimize the product mix to drive that ASP up and also, of course, continuing to deliver on our cost reduction. And so on the cost reduction, we've done well so far. We've been in the mid-teens. I expect us to also hit that mid-teens percentage cost reduction for this fiscal year. So as the pricing continues to improve, I would anticipate that we would be -- we would also be there in the -- let's say, in the next few quarters."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Christopher James Muse', ""I guess, I was hoping to focus on the NAND bit side of the house. You're talking about optimizing product mix. But here, we have bits down in December. It looks like they're down -- implied down again in the March quarter. So can you speak to, I guess, your plans there? When do you think that will open up? And can you be a little more specific in terms of which end markets you're focused on? And how we should think about when they come to market and the timing and implications to pricing?"", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes. So I'll start, and Wissam can add some, too. So yes, we had bits down. We had a record quarter last -- 2 quarters ago, and then we were down a little bit this past quarter, then we'll be down more. I mean it's just a reflection of the flow-through, the underutilization that we were doing to kind of keep supply and demand matched. We've talked about this a lot and not let our inventory get out of control. I think we've been very good about keeping our inventory. We're at a 4-year low on inventory on the NAND side. So look, C.J., we're just going to keep very focused on what demand is, where we're at in inventory and adjust the utilization of the fab to make sure those stay aligned as we go forward. So I think as we said in the script, you kind of assume that throughout this calendar year, you're going to see most of the growth in flash be from pricing. As far as -- go ahead, please. No, I was going to move on the second part of your question."", 'Christopher James Muse', 'Yes. Please, go ahead.', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Okay. So mix is like -- mix is just a very dynamic process like literally day by day, week by week in the business. We have a big consumer franchise. We sell all over the world. We have hundreds of thousands of points of presence in e-tail platforms. We have a big channel business where pricing can get adjusted weekly, then all the way up to, obviously, the quarterly negotiated market. So we're just always dynamically understanding where pricing is going to be. And then, again, in each of those segments, we have different products. We have client SSDs that are WD_BLACK, all the way down to WD Green. So in different segments of the market, all with different price points, all with different margins, all with different demand profiles. And it's a constant process of just making sure we put the supply where we're going to get the best return. This last quarter, we talked about we mixed a little bit out of client and into consumer, as you would expect in a strong consumer quarter, and we'll continue to do that. The place where we're still waiting for it to come back is enterprise SSD. That's still been pretty depressed. And as that market starts to come back, we expect to mix into that as well."", 'Christopher James Muse', 'Very helpful. If I could ask just a quick follow-up, Wissam, can you shed some light on how to think about OpEx into June quarter and beyond?', 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""Yes. Of course, C.J. So on the OpEx side, for the June quarter, I expect us to be more or less in line. Beyond that, as the business profitability continues to improve, I expect a gradual increase. But we're laser focused on profitability, and so I don't anticipate to increase our OpEx faster than revenue growth, of course. And when you look at where we've come from and where we are today, we're still at or maybe more than 20% lower than where we were at the beginning of the cyclical downturn."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.', 'Karl Ackerman', ""I have 2, if I may. The first, why do you think there was a doubling of China demand for [via] applications this quarter? And how sustainable do you think that is? I asked because the Chinese economy hasn't been robust for some time, so any thoughts on that would be helpful."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes. I wouldn't attribute it to the smart video market. It's more of the China hyperscalers coming back and better demand there."", 'Karl Ackerman', ""Got it. Okay. I guess to switch to the manufacturers, if I may. It's nice to see an improving outlook for March, certainly one quarter ahead of many of our expectations. However, I'm a bit surprised to see your NAND ASP trajectory in December below that of peers. So is there any reason why your NAND prices or ASPs perhaps would fall behind peers from here and/or maybe there would be a catch-up opportunity as well?"", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes, price deltas, obviously, have a big dependency on your starting point, and we were starting from a better gross margin position than anybody else in the industry by quite a bit. So -- and then on top of that, you have mix based on what's happening in the quarter and kind of where the product is going. I think if you look at profitability of the franchise, it's still leading the industry."", 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from Tim O'Malley with Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""It's Tom O'Malley here at Barclays. So I wanted to ask on the competitive environment. Your competitor, obviously, talked about 1 million unit shipments of HAMR in the first half of the calendar year here. I just wanted to get your comments on, are you seeing any change in your interactions with your customers? Are they pointing to HAMR as a solution that they're going to move to early in the year? Can you just talk to just the broader ecosystem and if you're seeing a transition there? Or if it's the other side really, clearly, you're seeing some better trends with your UltraSMR drives. Just any color on that transition with your customers would be helpful."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""I think customers just want to understand everybody's road map, right, and they're not looking for a particular solution. I mean, for example, we've been shipping ePMR drives for years versus PMR drives, and nobody really asks us for ePMR drives. So they just want the capacity point at a TCO, at a reliability level and be able to satisfy their demand. And I think that's the way we've optimized our portfolio. We've commercialized ePMR. We're very happy with the technology. We have UltraSMR on top of that. That allows us to deliver both the highest capacity points in the industry, the best TCO position at very, very large scale, right? We can produce millions and millions of those drives per quarter. So that's what customers are looking for, and they're looking to understand on your road map that you can continue to drive that TCO equation forward because they're obviously betting extremely large data centers on our ability to do that. And our customers -- I can tell you, our customers have an enormous amount of confidence in our road map in our current products, and you're seeing that in the performance of the business. You're seeing accelerating growth. You're seeing better profitability. You're seeing share gains. That's a clear indication that customers are very happy with our products. Now, in particular, on the transition of ePMR to HAMR, I know this has gotten a lot of attention. For our portfolio given our UltraSMR technology, it's been adopted by the market. HAMR does not make sense until you get to 4 terabytes per platter because HAMR adds a lot of cost to the product. So it adds a lot of cost to your bill of material. So we can -- we see the next couple of generations or a couple of years of ability to deliver a very strong TCO proposition at scale on the ePMR plus UltraSMR platform that customers have clearly adopted. We see it as the majority of our demand in calendar year '25. We will transition to HAMR when we get to that 4 terabytes per platter. That's the economic crossover, right, that we're looking for from a portfolio management point of view. So that gives you a little more color on how we're thinking about the technology, the transition and how customers are thinking about it. I think -- it's very clear. Customers are very happy with our road map, and they understand in great detail where we're going."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", 'Perfect. And then just one quick one on HDD gross margins. I think when you look at the underutilization charges that are still present, you can look at just taking that out and what that means for the gross margins over the next couple of quarters. But is there any way to frame like a revenue level that gets you back to that 30% gross margin target for the HDD business? Or is it kind of just a wait and see when utilization picks back up and it will get there eventually? Any just way to frame that from a modeling perspective as to when that can get back to your range?', 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""So Tom, if you look at our numbers and you adjust for the underutilization charges, we're almost there. So what I would say -- instead of giving a number or movement, let's say, in quantifying it, what I would say is I expect us to be at the 30% level, at a lower level than our normal run rate that we've had in any prior through-cycle periods. We've taken quite a bit of cost out of our cost structure, as you very well know. And so that will help us get there at a faster pace. With respect to underutilization, I do anticipate to probably have a bit more -- another quarter of underutilization beyond this one. And then we'll see where we are in the June quarter, and then we can talk about it then."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.', 'Krish Sankar', ""Two of them. The first one on NAND. Either Dave or Wissam, how do you think of the sustainability of NAND pricing into the back half given that there's a view that first half pricing could be up from a calendar year base, calendar close [of we have] over 50%. How do you think about the sustainability? And what would be the trigger point for you to start adding capacity in that? And then just a sort of follow-up on the hard drive side, you kind of mentioned HAMR adds cost, which kind of makes a lot of sense given the laser and NFT. Very curious, whenever you start doing it, would you do it with 10 disks? And if the market wants a HAMR solution from WD, how soon can you get it?"", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Okay. There's a lot in there. So on NAND, look, what we -- we obviously look at a lot of things in NAND. There's a lot of stuff that goes into supply of NAND, from utilization rates to nodal transitions to CapEx investment. And it's a complicated equation. But our current view is we see NAND undersupplied for quite some time in the market, and that's appropriate given where we are in the profitability of the business. As I said in the prepared remarks, look, we're happy to see the inflection in pricing and the performance of the business, and it's ahead of where we thought it was going to be. But we've got a long way to go before we're going to get to the profitability levels where we're going to -- where investment is going to come back. And I think the answer to your question, we need very clear visibility into through-cycle profitability numbers that match our model. And we're coming out of a deep hole, and that would imply that you need to be above your through-cycle level for a while to get to that level over time. So that's what we're looking at, and we expect pricing to -- pricing is notoriously difficult to predict, and we're very careful that we don't forecast it. But clearly, we're predicting good pricing increases into the next quarter, and we will stay very disciplined of managing supply and demand in our business. We talked about that bits are down sequentially. On HDD -- I'm sorry, could you just repeat the HDD question again so that I make sure I got it?"", 'Krish Sankar', 'Yes. Sure, Dave. I was just trying to figure out on the HDD side, a -- number one is HAMR. Will you be doing it with 10 disks? Second one is if the market wants a solution -- from Western Digital a HAMR solution, how soon can you get it out?', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes. So let me -- we'll defer the details of product launch on HAMR and how many disks it's going to have until we get closer to that process. I mean it's a project that we're happy with where the progress of it is given what I said earlier. We've got -- we've built a technology road map that allows us to get to 40 terabytes on very well-proven, cost-controlled, high manufacturing ability, technology. And we're looking forward to delivering that to the market over the next couple of years. The reality is there's no customer like demands a particular technology. The customer wants a capacity point at a certain TCO, at a certain level of reliability and a certain level of performance. And our technology road map is built to deliver that. What's inside the box is less important. The real thing is you have to deliver all of those that we just said, and you have to be able to manufacture it at a level of millions and millions of units per quarter to satisfy the market. That's what our customers are looking for. Our ePMR and UltraSMR technology, that's exactly what it delivers. The ability to deliver increasing TCO, which, if we can deliver increasing TCO, we can continue to drive pricing higher. We can produce it at very high scale, can be qualified very, very quickly and it's very highly reliable and high-quality products. And our customers are increasingly adopting that technology as you see from our forecast."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.', 'Wamsi Mohan', ""Dave, appreciate the answer you just gave around pricing. But if I could ask this a slightly different way, how would you think about pricing, the runway that you have in flash relative to past cycles? I mean given your commentary on how you manage your inventory, given your comments on expectation to be undersupplied for a long time, would you venture to say that the pricing runway that you have should be longer than what you've had in past cycles?"", 'David V. Goeckeler', 'On NAND?', 'Wamsi Mohan', 'Yes.', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Look, I mean, I think it's -- the cycle we just -- I guess we're not out of it. We're coming out of it. Like I said, like we're just taking the first steps out of a cycle we haven't seen before, I think, in the 3D era. So what we're doing, Wamsi, is just making sure we get our supply and demand matched and make sure we keep our inventory control and deliver the best profitability given the portfolio we have and continue to optimize the portfolio that we can have the best mix and therefore the best profitability. It's very difficult to predict future pricing. But our general point is that although things are going in the right direction, we're not close to a point where the CapEx investment is going to come back. And I think that's the real number on what future supply is going to be. I mean, clearly, there's some utilization that is going to come back, but it's going to be needed, quite frankly. And we're going to wait to see on, as I said, through-cycle profitability, where we have visibility to that to reinvest more in this business."", 'Wamsi Mohan', 'Okay. If I could, you mentioned about entering a multiyear growth period with generative AI and especially at the edge, the demand for NAND bits. When do you think that the industry will start to see this demand for NAND bits at the edge start to inflect higher?', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes. Look, I think we're going to see it as we start to go into PC refresh cycles, admitted that we're still very early in this, right? Getting the cloud -- I mean, the big part right now is getting the cloud capable of delivering gen AI to all of us and then drive that architecture down to the edge. I think we're starting to see in some of the markets some of the future specs of products where they're increasing the amount of NAND. So we're optimistic about that as we go through the next couple of years and this architecture gets deployed and adopted. So I can't like put it down to a particular quarter for you. But certainly, as new technology launches or new technology adoption, it's moving at a faster pace than any technology I've seen in a very long time."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.', 'Mehdi Hosseini', 'Just wanted [to get a] clarification. David, did you say that NAND bit demand is tracking to mid-teens and that compares to bit supply growth of 5%?', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes. We see demand around mid-teens, and that's [fab out]. What we see is kind of fab production of mid-single digits. And obviously, there's inventory between those."", 'Mehdi Hosseini', 'Okay. Now what got me confused is you also said your NAND inventory is a multiyear low. Did I misunderstand you?', 'David V. Goeckeler', 'You did not misunderstand me.', 'Mehdi Hosseini', ""Okay. So if your inventory is a multiyear low and demand [is well] exceeding supply, so you basically are not going to ship to supply -- or you're not going to ship to demand throughout the year? And then price increase would..."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes, we'll ship to our share of demand throughout the year."", 'Mehdi Hosseini', ""Okay. Would that impact your market share, or you're focusing on like more profitable end market?"", 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""No, we don't anticipate that to impact our market share, Mehdi. The stats that you mentioned on the supply and production were for our estimates and what we see from third-party estimates on the overall market."", 'Mehdi Hosseini', ""Okay. That's overall market, not a reflection of Western Digital..."", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Exactly. Go ahead, Mehdi. I'm sorry. No, no. Please, go ahead."", 'Mehdi Hosseini', 'Yes. So these are market trends, not specific to Western Digital. And then if I may just have a quick follow-up, in terms of a NAND cost down, should we assume that long-term trend of, what, down 10% in terms of CAGR...', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""No, we're comfortable with the 15% cost downs, right? We believe that if you -- I mean, we're ahead of that right now in FY '24, quite frankly, but it will come back. And I think when you look at the full year, you can still model 15% for the fiscal year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.', 'Steven Bryant Fox', ""I was just wondering, on enterprise SSDs, you mentioned that they're still depressed and you'll mix into it. But given the supply situation that you just talked about and where we are in the cycle, like what is your -- how do you envision coming back in that market? And like can you just remind us what a normal mix of enterprise SSDs looks like in your flash business?"", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Well, I mean, for us, it's an emerging part of the portfolio. I think going right into the downturn, we got qualified at numerous -- or a number of cloud titans in our NVMe-based enterprise SSD. And then we kind of went into a market where, quite frankly, enterprise SSD has been the most depressed part of the NAND market in the downturn, and we haven't seen that come back yet. So as that starts to come back out of digestion, it will just be another opportunity for us to mix into that. How much we mix into it will be depending on what the price is in that segment versus other options we have for those bits. So we don't necessarily have a fixed percentage we're going for. It's just we have the product. It's qualified. As demand comes back, we'll consider that demand in part of the whole portfolio calculus."", 'Steven Bryant Fox', 'Would the big picture be that it trails the enterprise HDDs by a certain amount of time in general? Like do you have a vision for just as enterprise spending recovers, where that product cycle would be?', 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Well, certainly, it is trailing enterprise HDD. I mean enterprise -- I don't know if I could make a generalization about that because it's just one cycle here. But clearly, there was -- there's more inventory digestion in the hyperscale market on enterprise SSD than there was in capacity enterprise HDDs. As we talked about, we see continued growth in capacity enterprise HDDs. We started out this fiscal year projecting sequential growth throughout the fiscal year, and now we're talking about sequential growth throughout the calendar year. So we see good demand trends coming back on capacity enterprise HDD, which, again, is a good sign for enterprise SSDs will come back. It's just there's a little -- there's more inventory digestion to get through."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company.', 'Mark S. Miller', 'Your cash flow significantly improved during the quarter. But still, there was an outflow. When do you expect to be positive from a free cash flow perspective?', 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""Yes. Mark, so turning free cash flow positive is a top priority for us. We're very much focused on it, and we have line of sight to achieving it. We expect to achieve free cash flow positive in the second half of the fiscal '24, either this quarter or the next. As you know, we typically don't guide for cash flow."", 'Mark S. Miller', ""Do you expect to -- will you have to draw on your revolver? Or do you expect that you won't have to draw on it?"", 'Wissam G. Jabre', ""I don't see that at this point."", 'Operator', 'The last question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.', 'Ananda Prosad Baruah', ""Just wondering, do you have -- you guys have an early opinion on if NAND bit rate increases as gen AI sort of impacts not just edge cycles but sort of corporate cycles, Fortune 1000 [and the hyperscalers] storage as well and all the other sort of end market constituencies. Do you have any opinion on if there's a sort of increase in NAND supply [over time]? And if you do, do you think the increase could be material and noticeable?"", 'David V. Goeckeler', ""Yes. So it's a good point here, which is -- like my comments earlier were about the cycle and what we see in NAND and investing in it. We're big believers in the NAND market, and there's going to be a lot of bit growth in the future. And also, the great thing about the NAND market is you still have the ability to produce new nodes and more efficient as far as how much capital you need to put in to get that growth. So look, the overall thesis on NAND continuing to grow, we have a long technology road map where we can continue to deliver cost downs. That's still a great story, and we expect -- to your point, we expect generative AI to be additive to that, especially on the edge. The NAND market has really, through this downturn, really rotated to an edge-centric market, which, again, our portfolio is very, very well positioned for with our consumer business, with our client SSD business, with our gaming business, with our position with PC OEM. So we're very well positioned there. And yes, as we see that demand come back and it resets the economics of the industry, we have the ability to go satisfy that demand. And so I think you're very bullish about that.All right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your time today. We'll see you throughout the quarter. Take care."", 'Operator', ""This concludes our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.""]"

And these geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are causing the oil market to price in a higher probability of a supply disruption.

We've heard that from multiple companies, whether that be Google, whether that be Microsoft, or Amazon, as you were mentioning a moment ago. All of them trying to figure out where they can put the best allocation of headcount and resources towards this next almost cloud-like moment for the industry here.

Last time I had seen any type of headcount restructuring like that, they were bracing and-- not even bracing. They were gearing up for the cloud.

Since the decade began, all three major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years. These swings have been especially noticeable for the growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)."", ""In 2022, the Nasdaq Composite shed a third of its value and was, by far, the worst-performing major index. Last year, its 43% gain topped the charts. But in spite of this gain, the Nasdaq Composite is the only major stock index that's yet to reach a new all-time high. In the wake of the 2022 bear market, it remains 4% below its November 2021 record close."", 'For some investors, this 26-month lull will be viewed as a lost period for growth stocks. But for long-term investors, it represents an opportunity to pick up growth stocks, innovators, and industry leaders at a perceived discount.', ""What follows are four spectacular growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear-market dip."", ""The first magnificent growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying with the Nasdaq Composite still below its record high is fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Even though competition in the digital-payments space is heating up, PayPal has the tools necessary to succeed."", ""To start with, it's on the cutting edge of one of Wall Street's hottest growth trends. Annual fintech revenue is forecast to grow by a factor of six -- from $245 billion to $1.5 trillion -- between 2022 and 2030, according to a report from the researchers at Boston Consulting Group. Even if this estimate isn't spot-on, it demonstrates how early we still are in digital-payment adoption."", ""Despite stagnant active-account growth in recent quarters, PayPal's user engagement among active accounts is higher than it's ever been. In less than three years, active accounts have gone from averaging 40.9 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period to averaging 56.6 transactions over the TTM, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Since PayPal is mostly driven by fees, more transactions should equate to higher gross profit."", ""The hiring of Alex Chriss as CEO is another watershed moment for PayPal. Chriss comes over from Intuit, where he headed the company's segment focused on small businesses. Chriss understands the innovations and opportunities PayPal has with smaller merchants but isn't afraid to make tough choices and reduce the company's operating expenses to bolster its margins."", ""Finally, PayPal stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Shares can be purchased, as of this writing, for less than 12 times forward-year earnings. Considering the company's long-term growth prospects, industry-leading position in fintech, and aggressive share-repurchase program, it's a screaming bargain."", 'A second spectacular growth stock you\'ll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear-market swoon is furniture company Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). While simply saying ""furniture stock"" is enough to put some investors to sleep, I can assure you this small-cap furniture company is nothing like its peers.', 'The clearest differentiator between Lovesac and other furniture companies can be seen in its products. Though it was originally known for its beanbag-styled chairs (""sacs""), approximately 90% of net sales now derive from sactionals, which are modular couches that can be rearranged a host of ways to fit most living spaces. Sactionals have an assortment of high-margin upgrade options and come with over 200 different cover choices. The yarn used in their production is made from recycled plastic water bottles. It\'s a unique and highly functional product with no comparison.', 'Uniqueness does come with a price -- and a purpose. Although sactionals are costlier than typical sectional couches, Lovesac is purposefully targeting a mid-to-high-earning consumer with its furniture. High earners are less likely to change their buying habits during modest recessions or above-average periods of inflation.', ""Another reason Lovesac has handily outperformed other furniture companies is its omnichannel sales platform. Despite having a brick-and-mortar presence in 40 U.S. states, it leans on online sales, pop-up showrooms, and partnerships with major retailers to improve brand visibility and increase sales. This omnichannel platform has reduced overhead expenses and lifted Lovesac's operating margin."", 'Similar to PayPal, Lovesac is historically inexpensive. Shares can be had for 11 times forward-year earnings, which is cheap when considering that the company can more than triple its earnings per share over the next five years.', ""The third amazing growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio following the 2022 bear-market drop for the Nasdaq Composite is China-based e-commerce company Alibaba (NYSE: BABA). In spite of recently weak economic data out of China, the long-term growth story and valuation with Alibaba are impossible to ignore."", ""The first notable catalyst for Alibaba is the reopening of the Chinese economy following roughly three years of stringent COVID-19 lockdowns. Even though Chinese regulators ended the controversial zero-COVID mitigation strategy in December 2022, it's taking time to work through persistent supply chain kinks. When the Chinese economy finds its stride, once more, Alibaba will undoubtedly benefit."", ""Investors should also appreciate Alibaba's leading position in e-commerce. An expansive middle class in China means there's a long growth runway for online retail sales. Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall collectively account for 50.8% of e-commerce market share in one of the largest markets for consumption in the world."", ""Beyond e-commerce, Alibaba is making quite the name for itself in cloud computing. Tech analysis company Canalys pegged Alibaba's share of China's cloud-infrastructure services market at 34% during the first quarter of 2023.

Strength in Kraft Heinz’s AGILE@SCALE and strategic partnerships are generating solutions throughout the value chain to drive growth and efficiency. As part of the AGILE@SCALE strategy, management is building digital-first solutions to fuel gross efficiencies.Kraft Heinz is benefiting from strength in its three key pillars — Foodservice, Emerging Markets and U.S. Retail Grow platforms. In the Foodservice business, management prioritizes higher margin spaces and undertakes customer-friendly innovations to drive growth. Kraft Heinz’s data-driven and repeatable go-to-market model has been yielding across emerging markets. Strength in the Heinz brand bodes well in such markets.', 'Kraft Heinz is undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve its performance. In fact, robust pricing strategies have been shielding margin performance amid inflation. In the third quarter of 2023, the company’s organic net sales increased 1.7% on favorable pricing to the tune of 7.1 percentage points — stemming from higher list prices to counter escalated input costs. Adjusted gross margin expanded 396 basis points (bps) to 34%, driven by pricing actions undertaken to offset inflation, solid gross supply chain efficiencies and a favorable mix in North America. The continuation of this trend is likely to keep contributing to the company’s margin.', 'Kraft Heinz continues to battle an inflationary environment, although the inflation continues to moderate. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it is seeing persistent inflation in areas like labor, tomatoes and sugar. The company is also incurring high SG&A costs across marketing, R&D and technology. Although such investments are likely to contribute to long-term growth, they might put pressure on profits in the near term.All said, the company’s well-knitted transformation efforts and pricing actions are likely to keep narrating its growth story.', 'Players like Sysco Corporation SYY, Flowers Foods, Inc. FLO and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW have also been grappling with inflationary headwinds.Sysco has been encountering product cost inflation for a while now.

During the quarter, Sysco’s adjusted operating expenses escalated 2.9% year over year. The persistence of these trends is a concern.Flowers Foods is battling hurdles due to cost inflation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, FLO battled input cost inflation, reduced production volumes, higher product returns and elevated labor and maintenance costs. Volatility in commodity costs remains an aspect to be watched for Flowers Foods.Although Lamb Weston’s gross margin increased year over year, it was hurt to some extent by increased costs per pound in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Escalated costs per pound reflect mid-single-digit cost inflation for key inputs like raw potatoes, grains, starches and labor. In its last earnings call, LW highlighted that it expects fiscal third-quarter gross margin to be under pressure by escalated manufacturing costs, reflecting lower fixed cost coverage and other cost inefficiencies.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Again, taking all this together, I\'m just wondering whether they really need to take a bulldozer to the front office and rethink things.""', 'The ongoing situation also led Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein to downgrade Boeing shares to Neutral from Buy. Epstein lowered his price target to $225 per share from $255 previously.', '""Just to be clear, what\'s going on at Boeing is the result of probably 15, 20 years of a cultural shift in the company,"" Epstein wrote in a note.

""We will also work closely with our airline customers as they complete the required inspection procedures to safely return their 737-9 airplanes to service.""', ""Boeing's market cap has shrunk by almost $30 billion since the Jan. 5 mid-air incident.

But, in a statement Friday, McMahon said that he has resigned.', '“Out of respect for the WWE Universe, the extraordinary TKO business and its board members and shareholders, partners and constituents, and all of the employees and Superstars who helped make WWE into the global leader it is today, I have decided to resign from my executive chairmanship and the TKO board of directors, effective immediately,” McMahon said in a statement.', 'Reports that McMahon had paid out settlements to multiple women while serving as WWE’s CEO and chairman have been circulating since at least 2022, but the lawsuit, filed by Grant Thursday, sheds new light on the extent of McMahon’s alleged misconduct.', 'In the lawsuit, Grant alleged that McMahon dangled a job offer at WWE – and later promotions – in exchange for sex. Grant’s lawsuit also alleges that McMahon trafficked her to other men inside and outside the company, including John Laurinaitus, who worked in the company’s talent relations department and is also named as a defendant in the suit.', 'McMahon engaged in acts of “extreme cruelty and degradation” toward Grant during her time at WWE, the lawsuit alleged.', 'TKO, in an email to staff and in a statement to the press, addressed only McMahon’s job status with the company but did not discuss the specifics of the allegations.

It comes with the job, you know. Earlier this week, several of these tools sent me a whole lot of news announcements, nearly buzzing that phone out of my pocket. I was in for an eye-opening discovery.', 'According to these unexpected notifications, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) just split its stock. Oh? Maybe they announced it in that game-changing earnings report and nobody noticed? I guess it could happen.', ""Wait -- International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) did the same thing. Then there's Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), just to name a few. There's no way all of these giants could have performed stock splits in unison, like a Gregorian chant of Wall Street accounting tricks, without generating miles and miles of headlines. Besides, I couldn't find the same stock-split announcements through my usual sources, which focus on the American stock market."", 'So I looked at the notifications again, zeroing in on the stock tickers. And then it hit me.', ""These stock splits, all taking place on Wednesday, didn't actually involve the American stocks. Every single announcement was about each company's presence on the Argentinian stock market, at the Buenos Aires exchange."", ""Yes, Netflix and Apple really did split their stocks this week, but not because their listings on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges were growing too pricey. Most of them may get there soon, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see a normal Netflix split someday soon -- but Bank of America's shares only cost $33 each."", ""Things look very different on the Buenos Aires exchange, where investors must struggle with Argentina's incredible hyperinflation. Here, Netflix trades at roughly 14,700 Argentine pesos per share after Wednesday's 3-for-1 stock split. That's about $18 at current exchange rates. But things change fast in Argentina. In early December, the same stash of pesos was worth $41. A year ago, it was $79. It's no wonder that American companies feel the need to adjust their share prices amid this catastrophic exchange-rate trend."", ""The U.S. dollar's inflation rate briefly soared to 9.1% in June 2022. It was a painful jump with game-changing effects on business and personal finance in this country, sparking heavy-handed anti-inflation policies from every level of our government."", ""The Argentine crisis is orders of magnitude worse. December's prices were 25.5% above November's and 211% higher on the same year-over-year basis you see most often in American inflation reports."", 'You might think the prices of American stocks on the Buenos Aires exchange are a low priority in times like these. However, Argentinians with the means and foresight to invest in these stable value stores have a powerful financial tool in their hands. As the peso loses its value, alternatives such as stocks, physical gold, or Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) become incredibly important. Other defensive options include real estate holdings, cars, or bills and coins in foreign currencies such as the dollar.', 'The total value of Netflix, Toyota, and Apple shares on the Buenos Aires market are always in lockstep with their underlying American counterparts, filtered through the effective currency exchange rates and different number of shares. Tapping into your foreign stock holdings (and other stable assets) can keep food on your table when the pesos in your pocket are turning worthless.', ""This reminder of the Argentine inflation crisis may not improve my investing strategy by much, but those buzzing notifications opened my eyes to the sheer scale of this monetary disaster. Now I understand why Netflix pointed to the falling peso as a 3% currency-exchange headwind for its top-line growth in the next quarter. And the American situation doesn't seem likely to mirror the Argentine crisis anytime soon, but a healthy reserve of gold or Bitcoin could be a life-saver if the next local inflation crisis is any worse than the recent one."", 'These stock splits, initially a curiosity, reveal the profound impact of global economic shifts. They underscore a vital truth for investors: the importance of vigilance in an interconnected world and the wisdom of diversifying beyond the traditional stock market. Diversify, stay alert, and maybe keep some Bitcoin or gold handy for a rainy day -- because when it rains on the scale of a national economy, it really pours.', 'When\xa0our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*', ""They\xa0just revealed what they believe are the\xa0ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Walmart wasn't one of them!

The company's success in maintaining a leading position is underpinned by its strategic focus on member experience, content excellence, and technological innovation, which collectively drive subscriber growth and retention."", ""Content Innovation and Brand Equity: Netflix Inc has established itself as a cultural phenomenon, with its original programming becoming a significant part of the global entertainment conversation. The company's investment in high-quality, diverse, and original content has not only enhanced its brand equity but also created a competitive moat. Netflix's ability to drive member joy through its content is a core strength, as evidenced by its numerous awards and recognitions. This content strategy has been pivotal in differentiating Netflix from its competitors and securing its position as a premier entertainment provider."", ""Content Acquisition Costs: One of the primary weaknesses of Netflix Inc is the high cost associated with content acquisition and production. As the company strives to maintain its competitive edge through original and exclusive content, it faces increasing expenses that impact its profitability. The need to continuously invest in content to attract and retain subscribers puts pressure on Netflix's financial resources, which could become a significant challenge if not managed effectively. Additionally, the company's reliance on external financing for content investments could expose it to market volatility and financial risks."", ""Dependence on Subscriber Growth: Netflix Inc's business model is heavily reliant on subscriber growth, which is subject to seasonal fluctuations and market saturation. The company's performance is closely tied to its ability to expand its subscriber base, making it vulnerable to any factors that may hinder membership growth, such as pricing changes, content appeal, or increased competition. This dependence on subscriber metrics for success underscores the need for Netflix to continuously innovate and adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics."", ""Expansion into Advertising: The recent introduction of ad-supported subscription plans presents a significant opportunity for Netflix Inc to diversify its revenue streams. By tapping into the advertising market, the company can capitalize on its massive user base and offer advertisers targeted access to a highly engaged audience. This strategic move not only opens up new income avenues but also provides a cushion against the volatility of subscription-based revenues. If executed effectively, the ad-supported model could drive substantial growth and enhance Netflix's financial stability."", ""Technological Advancements: Netflix Inc is well-positioned to leverage emerging technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, to enhance its service offerings and user experience. The company's focus on technological innovation can lead to improved content discovery, personalized recommendations, and interactive features that increase user engagement. By staying at the forefront of technological advancements, Netflix can maintain its competitive edge and continue to captivate audiences with a superior streaming experience."", ""Intense Competition: The streaming industry is characterized by intense competition, with numerous players vying for consumer attention. Netflix Inc faces challenges from traditional media companies, new entrants, and alternative entertainment options such as social media and gaming. Competitors with strong brand recognition, exclusive content rights, and substantial financial resources could potentially erode Netflix's market share. The company must remain vigilant and proactive in addressing competitive threats to sustain its leadership position."", ""Regulatory and Legal Risks: Netflix Inc operates in a complex regulatory environment that is subject to change. The company must navigate various content quotas, levies, investment obligations, and potential content restrictions imposed by different countries. Additionally, intellectual property disputes and content liability issues pose ongoing risks that could impact Netflix's operations and reputation. Effective management of these regulatory and legal challenges is crucial for the company's continued success."", ""In conclusion, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) presents a compelling case of a company that has successfully capitalized on its strengths, such as global market leadership and content innovation, to maintain a dominant position in the streaming industry. However, it must address weaknesses like high content costs and subscriber growth dependency to ensure long-term viability. The opportunities presented by advertising expansion and technological advancements offer promising avenues for growth, while threats from competition and regulatory risks require strategic vigilance. Overall, Netflix Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company that is well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the entertainment landscape, provided it continues to adapt and innovate in response to the ever-changing market conditions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

In the series, Vergara plays Griselda Blanco, the Colombian drug dealer who built an empire during the Miami drug wars in the 1970s and 1980s.', 'While preparing for the series, Vergara found herself in a dilemma: How does one convince the audience that they are no longer a light-hearted, comical and incredibly well-known character, but instead a durg trafficker who was also known as the “Cocaine Godmother” and “The Black Widow,” among other threatening nicknames?', 'More from WWD', ""Indoor-outdoor Trend Reinforced in Beauty Looks Seen at Milan Men's Fashion Week\xa0"", 'Sofia Vergara Named Schwarzkopf Global Brand Ambassador', 'The 18 Best Makeup Brush Sets for Every Level of Mastery', 'To help her on this mission, Vergara enlisted the power of makeup.', '“Getting the look correct was very important to me because I needed to disappear. I wanted no one to think of me or my last role as Gloria Pritchett,” Vergara said in a statement released by Netflix. “I had an incredible hair and makeup design team that did an amazing job creating this character.”', 'According to Andrés Baiz, director and executive producer of “Griselda,” the goal was to make Vergara feel like she was someone else.\xa0“Any difference that would give Sofía confidence was what became important — in the eyebrows, the nose, hair. She wanted to feel like a different person, but not to the point in which the prosthetics or makeup took over her performance. It had to be subtle,” Baiz said.', 'Angela Nogaro and Dennis Parker, the heads of “Griselda’s” makeup and hair departments, worked closely with Vergara’s beauty team — makeup artist Todd McIntosh and hairstylist Kelly Kline — to create the character’s look.', '“It’s all about taking her absolutely exotic face and turning it into an average face,” McIntosh explained. “One of Sofía’s signature features are her beautiful eyebrows. She wanted to not have those and have that tweezed-out, late-’70s look instead. So she’s wearing prosthetic eyebrow covers and then false eyebrows that are glued on top of that. Then she has a prosthetic nose that dulls down her beautiful, cute nose, and a plate of teeth that are slightly bucked, slightly uneven, a little bit discolored. We even yellow out her bottom teeth a bit more because she smokes all the way through the show.”', 'According to McIntosh, Vergara’s makeup transformation took about an hour and a half before each day on set.', '“Every time we tried to make her hair bigger or more exactly period, it just made her look too beautiful,” Kline said. “So every hairstyle is flatter and smaller than it really should be to make her look more real as opposed to just Sofía with a wig. It’s not about the hair in the show, where in real life, with Sofía, it’s all about the hair, the clothes and the glamour. This is not about hair and not about makeup, not about any of that. It’s about the story, and it’s fantastic.”', 'The result of Vergara’s transformation impressed everyone on the set, including showrunner\xa0Ingrid Escajeda. “The first day on set, I remember walking out thinking, ‘Wow, that’s Griselda.’ And underneath the prosthetics, Sofía’s natural charm shone through,” she said.', 'Vergara’s makeup transformation has been the subject of interest during the “Griselda” promotional tour. On “The Kelly Clarkson Show” on Wednesday, the actress talked about the process with the singer-turned-television host. “I feel like they only changed your nose,” Clarkson said. Vergara explained she spent “hours” to achieve the transformation. “They did a lot to me! It was teeth. It was wig. It was nose. It was plastic from here to here,” Vergara said.\xa0Clarkson added, “It probably took time, but the slight change completely changed your being….They did such a good job; it looks seamless.”', '“Griselda,” created by the same producers of “Narcos,” also features Karol G, Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez and Vanessa Ferlito.

Are there any kind of measures they can take to, say, offset emissions that then would satisfy the administration?"", 'ANDY LIPOW: Well, I think one of the biggest things that producers look at here in the United States is this carbon capture and sequestration, meaning that, as they produce the oil, especially if the natural gas is being burnt off into the atmosphere, to put that back and re-inject it into the ground or any of their carbon dioxide emissions need to be re-injected into the ground to lower what we call their carbon intensity.', ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Andy, I want to switch gears here a bit. Let's talk about oil. I'm looking at Brent here at 78. Where do you see that price headed, Andy, in the near to intermediate term here?"", ""ANDY LIPOW: Well, today, we had an event in the Red Sea where a missile struck an oil tanker that was on its way from the Mediterranean to Singapore. And that caused the oil market to completely turn around. We were down $1 this morning. We're up about $0.70 this afternoon. And these geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are causing the oil market to price in a higher probability of a supply disruption. So as a result, I'm expecting that we could see $80 WTI here in the next couple of weeks. And that, of course, translates into higher gasoline and diesel prices for the consumer.""]"

85,e527202d-9935-344e-84bc-ce7f731e4027,NEE,2024-01-27,"NextEra Energy Partners Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e527202d-9935-344e-84bc-ce7f731e4027/nextera-energy-partners.html,1706361000,STORY,"['NEP', 'NEE']","[""At one point, NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) was a hot master limited partnership (MLP) in the hot renewable-power sector. And then clean-energy investments fell out of favor on Wall Street, and NextEra Energy Partners' math changed in a big way. With a huge 12% distribution yield, is the risk of a different future worth taking on, or should investors avoid the MLP?"", ""If you look at NextEra Energy Partners as a business, you'll see that the MLP owns and operates renewable-power assets, such as solar and wind farms, among other things. But that's not really the purpose of the partnership. NextEra Energy Partners was created by utility giant NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) as a funding source. This isn't uncommon, but it is important to understand the relationship between parent NextEra Energy and its controlled MLP."", ""Basically, NextEra Energy builds renewable-power assets and then sells them, or drops them down, to NextEra Energy Partners. That helps NextEra Energy Partners grow its cash flows and allows parent NextEra Energy to raise capital to support its own growth plans. The key is that NextEra Energy Partners has to sell MLP units to raise the capital it needs to buy assets from NextEra Energy. When clean-energy stocks were a hot commodity on Wall Street, drop-down transactions were a no-brainer. At that point, investors were clamoring to buy NextEra Energy Partners' units."", ""Now that Wall Street has soured on the clean-energy industry, however, the math isn't nearly as attractive. That's why NextEra Energy has cut the guidance for distribution growth at NextEra Energy Partners in half, taking it from roughly 12% a year down to around 6%. That's a huge change, and it suggests that NextEra Energy Partners isn't nearly as desirable as many investors once believed it to be."", ""NextEra Energy is a very strong parent, as it's one of the largest and fastest-growing utilities in the United States. In fact, despite cutting the outlook for NextEra Energy Partners, NextEra Energy itself didn't change its financial outlook at all. The big change is that it doesn't expect to use NextEra Energy Partners as a funding source to the same degree, which is bad for NextEra Energy Partners' future."", ""However, NextEra Energy isn't at this point completely abandoning its offspring. The plan is to muddle through the near term as best as can be done while continuing to reward MLP unitholders with more modest distribution growth. And on that score, 6% distribution growth is hard to complain about. Given the contract nature of the assets NextEra Energy Partners owns, it has reliable cash flows. So for more aggressive investors, there are reasons to believe that the distribution will hold, if not continue to grow. At some point, if Mr. Market becomes more accommodating, growth could pick up again if NextEra Energy begins to drop down assets to the MLP again. If you have a glass-half-full view, it might be worth buying NextEra Energy Partners for its lofty yield."", ""There is one caveat here that can't be ignored. In the first nine months of 2023, NextEra Energy Partners paid out $554 million in distribution to unitholders. It generated cash available for distribution of $603 million. That means it paid out nearly 92% of the cash available for distribution, which doesn't leave a huge amount left over in case of adversity. Nor is there much money left behind to put toward business growth."", ""That last point is important, because, basically, NextEra Energy Partners really needs to tap the capital markets if it wants to keep growing its business. That's materially harder today than it used to be. A much quicker way to raise growth capital would be to cut the distribution and use the freed-up cash to fund its capital investment plans. That's a glass-half-empty view, but not an unreasonable take on the situation. If you're a conservative income investor, you might want to move on to a better-positioned high-yield investment."", ""The logic for buying and holding here is basically the same. However, there's a slight nuance for those worried about the distribution. A lot of bad news has been priced into the stock, which is now down nearly 70% from its 2021 highs. At this point, a distribution cut may not actually result in a material unit price drop, since a cut appears to have been priced in."", ""With the mood so negative, you might want to give NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners some time to figure out the future in more detail before making a final sell call, which might lock in material paper losses. And if NextEra Energy Partners manages to keep growing the distribution and its business despite the changed outlook, well, at least you get to keep the income stream while you wait for a possible unit price rebound. Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing. If you do go down this path, however, you'll want to make sure to keep watching the MLP's business progress to ensure that it doesn't take a turn for the worse."", ""NextEra Energy Partners is not the same MLP it was just a few years ago. That's been made clear by both parent NextEra Energy and investors.

(NYSE:NEE) just kicked off its latest full-year results with some very strong numbers. Results were good overall, with revenues beating analyst predictions by 6.1% to hit US$28b. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in at US$3.60, some 6.9% above whatthe analysts had expected. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on NextEra Energy after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""After the latest results, the consensus from NextEra Energy's 16 analysts is for revenues of US$27.4b in 2024, which would reflect a discernible 2.6% decline in revenue compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to reduce 5.0% to US$3.38 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$27.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.38 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", 'The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$70.55, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on NextEra Energy, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$84.00 and the most bearish at US$46.00 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.', 'Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 2.6% annualised decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 8.4% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 3.4% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - NextEra Energy is expected to lag the wider industry.', ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$70.55, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple NextEra Energy analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.', ""And what about risks?

The utility sector typically encompasses electric power, natural gas, water, and wastewater services. In 2023, the utility sector emerged as the weakest industry within the market. The S&P 500 Utilities index, a benchmark representing the performance of utility stocks, incurred a loss of approximately 10.6% over the course of the year. This contrasts starkly with the broader market sentiment reflected in the S&P 500, which recorded a substantial gain of 19.7% during the same period."", ""A recent Time report attributed the decline in the utility sector to the impact of climate change. This underscores a crucial reminder for investors that climate change is poised to challenge conventional notions about risk and return. Various industries, including agriculture, energy, and insurance, are confronting significant risks linked to climate change. Importantly, this doesn't imply that these sectors will become unsuitable for investment. On the contrary, companies within these industries are likely to necessitate capital to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change."", ""While utility stocks underperformed last year, a historical examination reveals that this has not been a consistent trend. According to Morningstar, utility stocks have demonstrated a robust performance, yielding an annual return of 11% since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. This figure is noteworthy as it nearly aligns with the total return of the entire U.S. market, inclusive of dividends. In 2022, utilities exhibited a remarkable outperformance, surpassing the broader market by an impressive margin of 21 percentage points. This marked the sector's most notable relative performance since the year 2000."", 'Despite their poor performance in 2023, there is a positive aspect for investors seeking to invest in these companies that pay dividends. According to analysts at Morningstar, a significant number of them are currently undervalued. This suggests that there may be opportunities for investors to find stocks in this category that are trading below their perceived intrinsic value, potentially offering a favorable entry point for those looking to allocate funds. The Morningstar report also mentioned that the sector presents an appealing income potential. The median dividend yield stands at 3.7%, marking its highest point since 2013. This figure is consistent with the 20-year average, indicating that the sector is currently providing income opportunities in line with historical trends.', ""The downturn witnessed in the utility sector throughout 2023 is not merely a result of isolated factors but is rather indicative of the sector's broader objectives and challenges. According to a report from Deloitte, in the same year, the power and utilities industry in the US elevated its commitment to decarbonization significantly. This commitment was demonstrated through the deployment of unprecedented volumes of solar power and energy storage, aimed at enhancing both grid reliability and flexibility.

Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it\'s one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the ""short-termism"" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.', '""You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.""', 'But how does Gabelli find ""specific stocks"" to invest in?

This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.""', ""In another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations.

This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers.

During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has lost 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $3.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.49 points to a change of +6.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.37 indicates a change of -1.1% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.3%. The $16.25 billion and $16.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +3.2%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'PulteGroup reported revenues of $4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%.

The EPS surprise was +4.32%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Sales of all these drugs were driven by market share gains. Importantly, the delay in the launch of biosimilar versions of the blockbuster drug Stelara benefited J&J’s top line. In May, J&J settled its litigation with Amgen AMGN, as a result of which J&J does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of Stelara in the United States until January 2025.', 'In addition, the rapid adoption of new products such as Carvykti, Tecvayli, Talvey and Spravato also contributed to top-line growth. The sales growth was partially dampened by lower sales of Imbruvica, the COVID vaccine and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.', 'In 2024, J&J expects to record above-market growth in the Innovative Medicine unit, for the 13th consecutive quarter. The growth is expected to be driven by key products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and the rapid adoption of new products. Innovative Medicine sales growth is expected to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half due to the potential entry of Stelara biosimilars in Europe in mid-2024. In fact, J&J expects the Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030.', 'The MedTech segment also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\xa0Sales in the MedTech businesses continued to benefit from strong procedure recovery and new products, which were partially offset by international sanctions in Russia and volume-based procurement issues in China in some categories.', 'In 2024, in the MedTech segment, J&J expects operational sales growth to be relatively consistent. Procedure volumes are expected to be above pre-COVID levels, with a modest impact of Russia sanctions in the first half.', 'J&J re-confirmed its full-year adjusted earnings and sales growth guidance that it had issued in December. In 2024, J&J expects total revenues in the range of $87.8 billion-$88.6 billion, which indicates growth in the range of 4.5%-5.5%, driven by both its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments.

The S&P 500 Utilities index, a benchmark representing the performance of utility stocks, incurred a loss of approximately 10.6% over the course of the year. This contrasts starkly with the broader market sentiment reflected in the S&P 500, which recorded a substantial gain of 19.7% during the same period."", ""A recent Time report attributed the decline in the utility sector to the impact of climate change.

Importantly, this doesn't imply that these sectors will become unsuitable for investment.

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the Best Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centers in Each of 10 Biggest Cities in the US.', ""Substance abuse is a disturbing problem that can have widespread debilitating effects on an individual, as well as their family. Drug addiction or substance abuse disorder, has been defined as a “disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine”. Unfortunately, there are numerous ways in which one can develop a chronic substance-abuse problem. Whether it is in response to peer pressure in social gatherings or just an attempt to experience all aspects of adolescent life, out of control drug usage can materialize from common occurrences. Prescription drugs can also lead to a dependency on pain killers, thereby, initiating a potential path down the addiction road. Furthermore, evidence also points to the idea that people with prior mental disorders are more likely to develop addiction habits. Given the nature of the issue, proper treatment is crucial in order to deal with this affliction. Hence, the best drug and alcohol rehab centers, equipped with the required expertise and medical experience, are in fact the most viable solution."", 'Statistics regarding drug and alcohol usage and death rate are indicative of the seriousness of the problem. Alcohol use alone has led to 2.3 million deaths worldwide. For the US, this figure stands at 95,000 and death by opioid overdose also amounts to 50,000 annually. 20% of the Americans have been reported for alcohol use disorder and 3.8% for opioids. There is also a huge prevalence of other drugs in the society. What is even more concerning is the alarming amount of population (half of the population below 12) being involved in illegal drug usage, at least once in their life. 70% of the people who experiment with illegal drugs before the age of 13 go on to become addicts in the next 7 years. Research has also brought to the forefront the fact that drug and substance abuse is most commonly found in young males within the age bracket of 18-25 years. Thus, a tenaciously extensive problem, that can hamper the future of a country, requires concentrated efforts and qualified help in order to effectively manage and mitigate its impact. The best drug and alcohol rehab centers in the US are offering to deal with this situation with highest quality of treatment, care and support.', 'While there are multiple social costs associated with drug and alcohol addiction, the financial aspect is equally significant. In 2020, the Federal Budget allocated $35 million for drug control. For users, the monetary feature can take many shapes. For instance, the use of the substance itself -- obtained legally or illegally-- as well as other associated costs like loss of job or absence from work or any legal charges etc. can become cumbersome. Then the cost of treatment in the best drug and alcohol rehab centers also varies with the centers, where it ranges from free to affordable to all the way up to expensive. A rough estimate for substance use, for an individual, has been reported at $11,487. The type of treatment is yet another factor that would have a strong impact on total cost. The cost for an individual’s drug rehabilitation has been estimated at $1,583 annually.', 'The pandemic hit the US substance-use disorder treatment market adversely in 2020, when it registered a 20% fall in the size, as compared to 2019. However, the market size was reported at $37.24 billion in 2022, and is expected to reach $60.18 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period. A growing number of people seeking treatment for the disorder and the availability of increased insurance have been cited as plausible forces behind the upward industry trend. Furthermore, the impact of technology in this industry is also engendering positive results by making virtual treatment options a possibility, thereby ensuring speedy and easy access.', 'There are many organizations -- private, non-profit, and public -- that are involved in mitigating the deleterious effects of substance use disorder. In this long list, while drug and alcohol rehab centers are the most important players, pharmaceutical companies also have a substantive role to play. They are developing and introducing better medications for combating drug effects on human body and psyche. ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAD) and TONIX Pharmaceutical Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: TNXP) are two very prominent names. Both are making constant head-ways in providing better coping mechanisms against substance use disorder. The big conglomerates like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) are also playing their part in giving back to the society by targeting such major problems.', 'ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.

This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Wells Fargo's shares on or after the 1st of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.35 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.40 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Wells Fargo has a trailing yield of approximately 2.8% on its current stock price of US$50.32.

With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Wells Fargo, with earnings per share up 3.0% on average over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth.

That amount would have put Scharf’s compensation on par with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan’s. Moynihan received $30 million for his work in 2022.', 'In its filing Thursday, Wells credited Scharf’s “strong leadership” in improving the bank’s financial performance. Net income at the bank jumped 40% in 2023, and its stock price climbed 19% on the year, according to Bloomberg.', 'Expenses, meanwhile, dropped nearly 3%. The bank has steadily reduced its headcount, shedding roughly 40,000 roles between the third quarter of 2020 and September 2023. Scharf has been unflinching in his effort to offload segments of Wells Fargo’s business model that are deemed “non-core.”', 'In its filing Thursday, Wells singled out Scharf’s effort to reduce the “size and complexity” of the bank’s home-lending business. Scharf last January announced Wells would streamline its mortgage division and exit correspondent lending.', 'The bank also lauded Scharf for “enabling Wells Fargo to be a source of strength during the 2023 regional banking crisis.” Wells poured $5 billion into First Republic in March as part of a multi-bank drive to save the fellow San Francisco-based lender from failing. The effort ultimately did not work, and JPMorgan Chase bought First Republic in May.', 'Among the work that remains for Wells Fargo, the bank is still operating under several enforcement actions tied to its 2016 fake-accounts scandal — most notably, a $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2018.

This caused the company to cut its dividend, pushing some investors away in the process."", ""Despite all of these challenges, Devon Energy still offers one of the most attractive dividends in the S&P 500. Its dividend consists of two parts -- a fixed component and a variable component based on excess free cash flow. Devon's dividend yield currently stands at roughly 7%."", ""The stock's valuation also is more attractive than it's been in quite a while due to the sell-off.

They include blood thinner Eliquis, breast cancer drug Ibrance, and prostate cancer drug Xtandi. However, the company appears to have a good strategy in place to handle these challenges."", 'Pfizer thinks that its new product launches and expansions of labels for existing products to include new indications will add roughly $20 billion in new annual revenue by 2030. It expects another $25 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 from business development deals. The recent acquisition of Seagen by itself could deliver $10 billion in new revenue.

Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 3.1% of patients.', 'Monitor patients closely throughout treatment for skin reactions. Consider topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent Grade 2 skin reactions, consider withholding PADCEV until Grade ≤1. Withhold PADCEV and refer for specialized care for suspected SJS, TEN or for Grade 3 skin reactions. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN; or Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions.', 'Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including fatal events, occurred in patients with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, treated with PADCEV. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 17% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV developed hyperglycemia of any grade; 7% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia (Grade 3: 6.5%, Grade 4: 0.6%). Fatal events of hyperglycemia and DKA occurred in one patient each (0.1%). The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 0.5 months (range: 0 to 20 months). Hyperglycemia led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 0.7% of patients. Five percent (5%) of patients required initiation of insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia. Of the patients who initiated insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia, 66% (23/35) discontinued insulin at the time of last evaluation. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (>250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV.', 'Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 10% of the 564 patients treated with combination therapy had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 4% had Grade 3-4. A fatal event of pneumonitis/ILD occurred in two patients (0.4%). The incidence of pneumonitis/ILD, including severe events, occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab compared to PADCEV as a single agent. The median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis/ILD was 4 months (range: 0.3 to 26 months).', 'In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 3% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 0.8% had Grade 3-4. The median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis/ILD was 2.9 months (range: 0.6 to 6 months).', 'Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis/ILD such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Evaluate and exclude infectious, neoplastic and other causes for such signs and symptoms through appropriate investigations. Withhold PADCEV for patients who develop Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis/ILD.', 'Peripheral neuropathy (PN) When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 67% of the 564 patients treated with combination therapy had PN of any grade, 36% had Grade 2 neuropathy, and 7% had Grade 3 neuropathy. The incidence of PN occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab compared to PADCEV as a single agent. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 PN was 6 months (range: 0.3 to 25 months).', 'PN occurred in 53% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials including 38% with sensory neuropathy, 8% with muscular weakness and 7% with motor neuropathy. Thirty percent of patients experienced Grade 2 reactions and 5% experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. PN occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting PN. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 PN was 4.9 months (range: 0.1 to 20 months). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients.', 'Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening PN and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when PN occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients who develop Grade ≥3 PN.', 'Ocular disorders were reported in 40% of the 384 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials in which ophthalmologic exams were scheduled. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included events associated with dry eye such as keratitis, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, limbal stem cell deficiency, and keratopathy. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 30% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 10% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.7 months (range: 0 to 30.6 months). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders.', 'Infusion site extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials, 1% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions, including 0.3% who experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. Two patients (0.3%) developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions.', 'Embryo-fetal toxicity PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during PADCEV treatment and for 2 months after the last dose.

Since the decade began, all three major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years. These swings have been especially noticeable for the growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)."", ""In 2022, the Nasdaq Composite shed a third of its value and was, by far, the worst-performing major index. Last year, its 43% gain topped the charts. But in spite of this gain, the Nasdaq Composite is the only major stock index that's yet to reach a new all-time high. In the wake of the 2022 bear market, it remains 4% below its November 2021 record close."", 'For some investors, this 26-month lull will be viewed as a lost period for growth stocks. But for long-term investors, it represents an opportunity to pick up growth stocks, innovators, and industry leaders at a perceived discount.', ""What follows are four spectacular growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear-market dip."", ""The first magnificent growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying with the Nasdaq Composite still below its record high is fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Even though competition in the digital-payments space is heating up, PayPal has the tools necessary to succeed."", ""To start with, it's on the cutting edge of one of Wall Street's hottest growth trends. Annual fintech revenue is forecast to grow by a factor of six -- from $245 billion to $1.5 trillion -- between 2022 and 2030, according to a report from the researchers at Boston Consulting Group. Even if this estimate isn't spot-on, it demonstrates how early we still are in digital-payment adoption."", ""Despite stagnant active-account growth in recent quarters, PayPal's user engagement among active accounts is higher than it's ever been. In less than three years, active accounts have gone from averaging 40.9 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period to averaging 56.6 transactions over the TTM, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Since PayPal is mostly driven by fees, more transactions should equate to higher gross profit."", ""The hiring of Alex Chriss as CEO is another watershed moment for PayPal. Chriss comes over from Intuit, where he headed the company's segment focused on small businesses. Chriss understands the innovations and opportunities PayPal has with smaller merchants but isn't afraid to make tough choices and reduce the company's operating expenses to bolster its margins."", ""Finally, PayPal stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Shares can be purchased, as of this writing, for less than 12 times forward-year earnings. Considering the company's long-term growth prospects, industry-leading position in fintech, and aggressive share-repurchase program, it's a screaming bargain."", 'A second spectacular growth stock you\'ll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear-market swoon is furniture company Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). While simply saying ""furniture stock"" is enough to put some investors to sleep, I can assure you this small-cap furniture company is nothing like its peers.', 'The clearest differentiator between Lovesac and other furniture companies can be seen in its products. Though it was originally known for its beanbag-styled chairs (""sacs""), approximately 90% of net sales now derive from sactionals, which are modular couches that can be rearranged a host of ways to fit most living spaces. Sactionals have an assortment of high-margin upgrade options and come with over 200 different cover choices. The yarn used in their production is made from recycled plastic water bottles. It\'s a unique and highly functional product with no comparison.', 'Uniqueness does come with a price -- and a purpose. Although sactionals are costlier than typical sectional couches, Lovesac is purposefully targeting a mid-to-high-earning consumer with its furniture. High earners are less likely to change their buying habits during modest recessions or above-average periods of inflation.', ""Another reason Lovesac has handily outperformed other furniture companies is its omnichannel sales platform. Despite having a brick-and-mortar presence in 40 U.S. states, it leans on online sales, pop-up showrooms, and partnerships with major retailers to improve brand visibility and increase sales. This omnichannel platform has reduced overhead expenses and lifted Lovesac's operating margin."", 'Similar to PayPal, Lovesac is historically inexpensive. Shares can be had for 11 times forward-year earnings, which is cheap when considering that the company can more than triple its earnings per share over the next five years.', ""The third amazing growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio following the 2022 bear-market drop for the Nasdaq Composite is China-based e-commerce company Alibaba (NYSE: BABA). In spite of recently weak economic data out of China, the long-term growth story and valuation with Alibaba are impossible to ignore."", ""The first notable catalyst for Alibaba is the reopening of the Chinese economy following roughly three years of stringent COVID-19 lockdowns. Even though Chinese regulators ended the controversial zero-COVID mitigation strategy in December 2022, it's taking time to work through persistent supply chain kinks. When the Chinese economy finds its stride, once more, Alibaba will undoubtedly benefit."", ""Investors should also appreciate Alibaba's leading position in e-commerce. An expansive middle class in China means there's a long growth runway for online retail sales. Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall collectively account for 50.8% of e-commerce market share in one of the largest markets for consumption in the world."", ""Beyond e-commerce, Alibaba is making quite the name for itself in cloud computing. Tech analysis company Canalys pegged Alibaba's share of China's cloud-infrastructure services market at 34% during the first quarter of 2023. Cloud services are a substantially higher-margin and faster-growing segment than e-commerce."", ""To keep with the theme, Alibaba is cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Excluding restricted cash, it ended September with more than $78 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity securities. Backing its net cash out of the equation leads to a forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of just 5 for a company with a history of double-digit growth."", ""A fourth spectacular growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear-market dip is none other than world-leading coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX). Even with higher labor expenses as a headwind, Starbucks possesses the competitive edges that make it a no-brainer buy."", ""One factor working in Starbucks' favor is the return to normal following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to having more than 16,300 stores in the U.S., Starbucks has north of 6,800 stores in China. The reopening story in China is just as important for Starbucks as it is for companies like Alibaba."", ""Something else that stands out about Starbucks is the incredible brand loyalty of its customers. In particular, Starbucks closed out its fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 1) with 32.6 million Rewards Members.

I’m bullish on this beaten-down fintech stock based on management’s new growth initiatives and its undemanding valuation.', 'New CEO Alex Chriss, who left Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to take over PayPal in September, had spoken of PayPal’s plans to “shock the world.” The company announced that it would unveil its new plans at a ‘First Look’ event, which took place yesterday.', 'Perhaps the plans weren’t as revolutionary as some investors and analysts were expecting because the market seemed underwhelmed by the strategic update, as the stock slid 3.7% for the day.', 'However, despite the market’s apparent lack of enthusiasm in the immediate term, the new initiatives that the company unveiled look well-suited to set PayPal up for further long-term growth. We’ll discuss some of the most intriguing highlights below.', 'The new Fastlane by PayPal initiative looks particularly promising. Finding and typing in a credit card number or remembering a username and password can add friction to the online checkout process. E-commerce vendors know all too well that any hiccup or disruption in the checkout process can drastically reduce their conversion rates, and Chriss stated that online shoppers end up not completing a purchase about 50% of the time.', 'Fastlane seeks to drastically reduce this friction and improve this experience. Users can save their information with Fastlane and “check out in as little as one tap, no username or password to a member. No personal info to update. No need to share a credit card with businesses all over the web.”', 'This would be a big deal for both customers and businesses alike — consumers will enjoy an easier and faster checkout process, while merchants should benefit from higher conversion rates, translating into higher sales. Fastlane is in a pilot phase right now, and if it takes off, it seems like a win-win for customers, merchants, and PayPal itself.', 'If Fastlane is successful, more customers and vendors will be eager to use PayPal. PayPal is currently testing the program with e-commerce platform Big Commerce (NASDAQ:BIGC) and says that they are seeing conversion rates as high as 70%.', 'PayPal is also rolling out Smart Receipts. These Smart Receipts not only allow customers to track their purchases, but they will use AI to suggest products that customers may want to purchase next and to offer personalized cashback offers to each customer. Emails with PayPal already have a high open rate (around 45%, according to Chriss), so taking advantage of this to make personalized offers and recommendations could be a real catalyst for merchants.', 'Other initiatives include the Advance Offers Platform, which seeks to personalize the way that customers are served ads online based on their shopping habits, right down to the SKU number. PayPal says that it will leverage its data from over half a trillion dollars worth of merchant transactions worldwide to “customize offers like never before.”', 'Another initiative, CashPass, will give U.S. customers access to personalized cashback offers from top merchants. Chriss said, “When you see an offer you like, you just tap on it. And when you shop with that business, the deal automatically applies when you check out with PayPal. One tap, it’s that easy.” CashPass will launch in March and will feature companies like Uber (NYSE:UBER), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).', 'These changes stand to make PayPal a more integral part of the online shopping process for both consumers and merchants alike, which will behoove PayPal stock over the long run.', 'Unlike some other beaten-down fintech names that have fallen from their peaks, PayPal stock is profitable. And it trades at an undemanding valuation. PayPal trades at just 11 times earnings. This is barely half of the valuation that the broader market trades at. The S&P 500 (SPX) has an average price-to-earnings multiple of 21.5.', 'It’s also much lower than the valuation that PayPal has typically enjoyed in the past. During the frothy days of 2020, PayPal shares traded at over 100 times earnings. Obviously, this was a bit frothy, but as recently as last January, PayPal traded for nearly 40 times earnings, roughly four times its current multiple.', 'I’m not saying that PayPal necessarily deserves to get back to 40 times earnings, but this illustrates how cheap the stock is compared to its historical valuation, and there is plenty of room for upside between 10 times earnings and 40 times earnings.', 'Turning to Wall Street, PayPal earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys, 16 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PYPL stock price target of $72.63 implies 19.6% upside potential.', 'PayPal stock has fallen a long way from its glory days. But the new CEO’s plans have the potential to send the stock higher. While the unveiling of the plan didn’t take the market by storm yesterday, it should help to set the stock up for more long-term growth. Furthermore, the stock’s undemanding valuation means it could be the right time to invest. PayPal reports earnings on February 10, so there could be volatility leading up to this report, but for long-term investors, PayPal looks like an interesting buy-low bet.', 'Disclosure']"

It comes with the job, you know. Earlier this week, several of these tools sent me a whole lot of news announcements, nearly buzzing that phone out of my pocket. I was in for an eye-opening discovery.', 'According to these unexpected notifications, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) just split its stock. Oh? Maybe they announced it in that game-changing earnings report and nobody noticed? I guess it could happen.', ""Wait -- International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) did the same thing. Then there's Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), just to name a few. There's no way all of these giants could have performed stock splits in unison, like a Gregorian chant of Wall Street accounting tricks, without generating miles and miles of headlines. Besides, I couldn't find the same stock-split announcements through my usual sources, which focus on the American stock market."", 'So I looked at the notifications again, zeroing in on the stock tickers. And then it hit me.', ""These stock splits, all taking place on Wednesday, didn't actually involve the American stocks. Every single announcement was about each company's presence on the Argentinian stock market, at the Buenos Aires exchange."", ""Yes, Netflix and Apple really did split their stocks this week, but not because their listings on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges were growing too pricey. Most of them may get there soon, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see a normal Netflix split someday soon -- but Bank of America's shares only cost $33 each."", ""Things look very different on the Buenos Aires exchange, where investors must struggle with Argentina's incredible hyperinflation. Here, Netflix trades at roughly 14,700 Argentine pesos per share after Wednesday's 3-for-1 stock split. That's about $18 at current exchange rates. But things change fast in Argentina. In early December, the same stash of pesos was worth $41. A year ago, it was $79. It's no wonder that American companies feel the need to adjust their share prices amid this catastrophic exchange-rate trend."", ""The U.S. dollar's inflation rate briefly soared to 9.1% in June 2022. It was a painful jump with game-changing effects on business and personal finance in this country, sparking heavy-handed anti-inflation policies from every level of our government."", ""The Argentine crisis is orders of magnitude worse. December's prices were 25.5% above November's and 211% higher on the same year-over-year basis you see most often in American inflation reports."", 'You might think the prices of American stocks on the Buenos Aires exchange are a low priority in times like these. However, Argentinians with the means and foresight to invest in these stable value stores have a powerful financial tool in their hands. As the peso loses its value, alternatives such as stocks, physical gold, or Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) become incredibly important. Other defensive options include real estate holdings, cars, or bills and coins in foreign currencies such as the dollar.', 'The total value of Netflix, Toyota, and Apple shares on the Buenos Aires market are always in lockstep with their underlying American counterparts, filtered through the effective currency exchange rates and different number of shares. Tapping into your foreign stock holdings (and other stable assets) can keep food on your table when the pesos in your pocket are turning worthless.', ""This reminder of the Argentine inflation crisis may not improve my investing strategy by much, but those buzzing notifications opened my eyes to the sheer scale of this monetary disaster. Now I understand why Netflix pointed to the falling peso as a 3% currency-exchange headwind for its top-line growth in the next quarter. And the American situation doesn't seem likely to mirror the Argentine crisis anytime soon, but a healthy reserve of gold or Bitcoin could be a life-saver if the next local inflation crisis is any worse than the recent one."", 'These stock splits, initially a curiosity, reveal the profound impact of global economic shifts. They underscore a vital truth for investors: the importance of vigilance in an interconnected world and the wisdom of diversifying beyond the traditional stock market. Diversify, stay alert, and maybe keep some Bitcoin or gold handy for a rainy day -- because when it rains on the scale of a national economy, it really pours.', 'When\xa0our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

In recent years, Nova Scotia has become a promising site for the clean energy transition, with some of the world's fastest offshore wind speeds and potential for hydrogen development."", 'But too often, conversations about the impact of energy development in the region do not include Indigenous perspectives or are inaccessible to people outside of the energy industry. Around the world, many vulnerable communities need support to participate in the energy transition. And while climate technology is minimizing impact and helping to make informed energy decisions, the next step in a just transition is to democratize this information and put it in the hands of communities.', 'Implementing science and technology alongside Indigenous knowledge and community engagement is an essential approach to address climate challenges, one that is known as ""two-eyed seeing."" To support a just transition, IBM® joined forces with nonprofit Net Zero Atlantic through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator to help enable informed climate decision-making and empower participation in the clean energy transition for Indigenous communities in Atlantic Canada.', 'A user-first approach to climate tech', ""Net Zero Atlantic's open source Atlantic Canada Energy System (ACES) Model is a powerful tool for analyzing and forecasting energy generation and infrastructure development scenarios.

""It\'s usually the other way around. People try to create the most accurate and most advanced model possible-but there\'s very little insight into how people use it and what motivates them to use it.""', 'The design of ""ACES Lite"" is focused on enabling the user to navigate complex graphs, geographical models and data interpretations with ease. The application puts user experience first, utilizing IBM technology like hybrid cloud and IBM® Cognos® Analytics alongside the expertise of volunteers from IBM Consulting® and more. And through Net Zero Atlantic\'s long-standing relationship with the Unama\'ki Institute of Natural Resources in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, ACES Lite has undergone important interactive testing sessions with Mi\'kmaq users to generate usability feedback and refine the tool further.', '""One of our key roles is to engage community. We do science, but we also engage community to bring forth the traditional knowledge that can be incorporated into that work,"" says Lisa Young, Executive Director of the Unama\'ki Institute of Natural Resources. ""The idea guiding this development was, ‘How can this tool inform how the community engages in the conversation about the energy transition? How does it help them make informed decisions?\'""', 'Two-eyed seeing and the importance of collaboration', ""Implementing technology alongside Indigenous knowledge is an approach known as two-eyed seeing, described by Mi'kmaq Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. Lisa Young shares that this is a guiding approach for the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources, and one that the project with Net Zero Atlantic and IBM has incorporated."", '""Two-eyed seeing means utilizing the best of Western science and technology, but also pairing it with the best of Indigenous perspectives, knowledge, and wisdom-so, how to use that knowledge in a good way, having a positive impact on the environment,"" says Young. ""In order to bring that perspective, you have to engage community broadly, to help us bring the knowledge from the land and guide us on how we advance the work.""', ""Scholtysik emphasizes the value of collaboration on this project with both IBM and the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources. He notes the expertise and enthusiasm of the IBM project team as a highlight of the organization's time in the IBM Sustainability Accelerator. Other communities in Canada, such as the government of Nova Scotia, offshore wind groups, and academic and research teams have also participated in the ideation and testing process thus far, expressing excitement about the tool's potential applications across the province."", ""What's next for ACES Lite"", 'As a next step, IBM and Net Zero Atlantic will continue to pilot ACES Lite with user groups in Cape Breton, while also exploring new innovations and additions. Feedback from the community has helped to identify where the user experience can be enhanced-for example, an opportunity to enhance the visualization aspects of land usage associated with the development of diverse clean energy technologies, and incorporating a feature that represents the economic impact of such projects. Scholtysik looks forward to bringing the application to the public by the end of 2024 and can even see its potential for deployment in other regions undergoing energy transition.', '""Energy system models are an excellent tool for people to have at their fingertips,"" says Scholtysik. ""Models like ACES Lite can make it easier for people to strategically plan for a future energy system that is sustainable, reliable and affordable.

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$6.7b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.52 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that McCormick is executing in line with expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on McCormick after the latest results."", ' See our latest analysis for McCormick ', ""Following last week's earnings report, McCormick's 15 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$6.74b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to grow 13% to US$2.88. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$6.89b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.89 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates."", ""The consensus has reconfirmed its price target of US$72.03, showing that the analysts don't expect weaker revenue expectations next year to have a material impact on McCormick's market value. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values McCormick at US$87.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$57.00. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that McCormick's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 1.2% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 5.4% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 2.4% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than McCormick."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$72.03, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

But even American Airlines CEO Robert Isom was critical when asked about Boeing's leadership."", '""We\'re a huge Boeing customer,"" Isom told analysts on Thursday. ""We\'re going to hold them accountable. Boeing needs to get their act together. The issues that they\'ve been dealing with over the recent period of time, but also going back a number of years now, is unacceptable.""', 'Alaska Air temporarily stopped using its 737 Max 9 fleet following the mid-air incident on Jan. 5.', '""As a longtime valued partner, we remain fully committed to our relationship with Boeing, but we also hold them accountable,"" Ben Minicucci, CEO of Alaska Air, said during the company\'s earnings call on Thursday.', 'When asked by analysts to elaborate, Minicucci said, ""The accountability is essentially on raising the quality standards at the factory as well as making us whole, but that will be secondary. Right now, we\'re focused on safety and quality and getting our fleet back to a full schedule.""', ""Alaska expects to take a financial hit of $150 million stemming from the fleet grounding. The carrier's flight cancellations have totaled anywhere from 110 to 150 flights per day."", ""Executives also estimate Boeing's problems will likely mean delayed plane deliveries in 2024 and 2025."", '""Going forward, we were meant to take 23 aircraft this year,"" Alaska Air CFO Shane Tackett told analysts on Thursday. ""Our suspicion is many of those will get delayed, but we don\'t know for how long.""', 'United Airlines expressed a similar concern. The carrier anticipated 31 of its deliveries this year would be Boeing Max 9 planes.', '""It is unrealistic at this time to believe all of those aircraft will deliver as currently planned,"" United CFO Mike Leskinen said earlier this week.', ""The airline also voiced concerns about Boeing's ability to deliver Max 10 aircraft, which have yet to be certified."", '""The reality is that with the Max grounding, this is the kind of straw that broke the camel\'s back with believing that the Max 10 will deliver on the schedule we had hoped for. And so, we\'re working through an alternate plan,"" Leskinen said, without specifying what those plans were.', 'Southwest Airlines (LUV) acknowledged ""uncertainty around the timing"" of Boeing deliveries and the certification of Boeing\'s Max 7 aircraft. Southwest expects 79 deliveries of 737 models this year.', '""Boeing has been a partner with us for 52 years,"" Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said during the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. ""I have absolute confidence that between the FAA oversight work that\'s going on — the work that Boeing is doing with the FAA — will address the quality issues and will obviously come out of this a better company.""', ""Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian also expressed faith in Boeing's ability to restore confidence. Delta does not currently operate the Max aircraft but placed an order for 100 737 Max 10 aircraft that it expects Boeing to incrementally deliver by 2025. Delta also has a purchase agreement for 20 Airbus (AIR.PA) A350-1000s to begin delivery in 2026."", '""Obviously, [it\'s] a concerning event,"" Bastian told Yahoo Finance. ""We will learn from this. I\'m confident we\'ll figure out what they need to do to ensure that we have confidence in the future performance of the Max.""', 'Some on Wall Street still seeking answers have called for a C-suite shakeup at Boeing following the Alaska Air incident.', '""I don’t know where the board of directors is,"" Mike Boyd, president of Boyd Group International, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I mean, you have their biggest customer, United, ticked off. You have Southwest, another big customer, ticked off and badly hurt financially as a result of this. Again, taking all this together, I\'m just wondering whether they really need to take a bulldozer to the front office and rethink things.""', 'The ongoing situation also led Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein to downgrade Boeing shares to Neutral from Buy. Epstein lowered his price target to $225 per share from $255 previously.', '""Just to be clear, what\'s going on at Boeing is the result of probably 15, 20 years of a cultural shift in the company,"" Epstein wrote in a note. ""That just won\'t change overnight, regardless of who you put in one role, and just one person can\'t do that. It has to be the whole company.""', 'Earlier this month, Boeing named retired Admiral Kirkland Donald of the US Navy as an independent adviser to lead a “quality review” of Boeing’s commercial quality management system and practices at Boeing plants as well as its oversight of suppliers.', 'And on Wednesday, the FAA said the grounded 737 Max 9 planes will be eligible to return to service once they undergo individual inspections and maintenance checks.', '“We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will also work closely with our airline customers as they complete the required inspection procedures to safely return their 737-9 airplanes to service.""', ""Boeing's market cap has shrunk by almost $30 billion since the Jan. 5 mid-air incident.

For those paired with a Guardian Angels Medical Service Dog, however, the rate so far stands at zero."", ""Guardian Angels Medical Service Dogs is a nonprofit based in Williston, Florida, that raises, trains and donates medical service dogs to veterans, first responders and civilians with permanent visible and invisible disabilities. Hundreds of veterans are on a waiting list to be paired, and the vast majority can't afford the roughly $25,000 it costs for a highly specialized service dog to help with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, mobility issues and more."", 'Organizations like PNC help by sponsoring dogs, making it possible for more veterans to receive the life-altering support of a service dog. PNC has also been part of the family-friendly Community Mutt Strut fundraiser since its inception in 2016. The Pittsburgh-based event includes dog costume contests, pet- and veteran-related vendors and auction items, and boasts more than $1.5M raised and 66 dogs sponsored as a direct impact.', 'A medical service dog can often be the exact accommodation an individual with a disability needs to thrive in a corporate setting. Mike Clark, a business analytics manager on PNC\'s Audit team, continued to struggle with PTSD and a post-traumatic brain injury for years after returning from his U.S. Army service to civilian life. But he got the support he needed from PNC, who worked with him and Guardian Angels to provide ""Super Service Dog"" Blade and completely transform Clark\'s world - at work and at home.', ""Now Clark and PNC General Auditor Stacy Juchno talk about Blade's impact over the years, how a recipient begins the process of transitioning an aging service dog into retirement, and whether there might be another service dog in Clark's future."", 'Transcript', ""Michael, PNC Employee: Yeah, so I joined the military right out of high school, and I spent a year and a half in the Persian Gulf, that was the Bosnia conflict. I decided I wanted to go to college. Went to Penn State University, I joined the ROTC program. In my senior year, 9/11 happened. I didn't have that typical opportunity of a college student to go do an internship. My internship at that time was Iraq. I finally hung up my uniform in 2015 and that's when I decided that I was going to pursue a career in corporate America at that point. I had really bad post-traumatic stress, I had a traumatic brain injury that still hadn't healed. I was scared, I didn't really know if I wanted to disclose whether or not I had these disabilities at the time. But PNC made it easy to do it."", ""Stacy, General Auditor: I knew at the time, before I had actually met Mike, that there was a veteran at PNC that was in need of a service dog and I think Mike connected with Guardian Angels Medical Service Dogs. He was one of the first folks that I know through anything we've done that he quickly got Blade and was prepared with Blade and now has a service dog."", 'And when I first met Mike, he was quiet, reserved, but present and when Mike joined Audit, he started to over the years start to work out of the quiet, reserved person and be a little bit more outgoing, taking on additional responsibilities, and I think with Blade with him over time helped open him up.', ""And now today, Mike is at every activity, every event, leading discussions, and I just think that I've seen this transformation over the last several years with Mike and it's just absolutely phenomenal. He's absolutely the light that walks in the room and brightens things up."", ""Michael: I mean, Blade's going to be 12 years old in January, and I'm, as dogs age, they lose their eye sight starts to diminish, her ability to really kind of sit and stay for long periods of time have gone from her being able to sit there with me through an eight-hour day to four hours and she's like nudging me, telling me it's time for us to go home. And she's been taking care of me all these years. Now it's time for me to shift gears and take care of her. And so she tells me she's ready to go home, then we're going to take her home and Guardian Angels, they've really helped me develop techniques on how to get her to transition to retirement. And it's something, things as simple as like talking to her and telling her, hey Blade, I'm going to work, you're going to stay home. Be a good girl. I'll see you in a few hours. Just constantly communicating that to her every day when I leave to come into the office is helping her kind of transition into this retirement mentality. PNC sponsored Blade from the beginning and just the fact that they've offered to get me another service dog when I need it, if I need it, really makes me, I just think that's an amazing thing. At this point in my life, I'm not sure I'm ready for another service dog. I think I'm still - I have this bond with Blade that I'm just not there yet. It's really time for us to shift into retirement mode.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Royal Caribbean Cruises in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger."", ""We can conclude that in regards to Royal Caribbean Cruises' returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And with the stock having returned a mere 8.0% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options."", ""Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Royal Caribbean Cruises   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should know about."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

However, from a value proposition, other compelling semiconductor stocks might make more sense.', 'For example, Nvidia continues to rise higher on the burgeoning AI ecosystem, which its graphics processing units (GPUs) undergird. Since the start of the year, NVDA gained almost 19% of equity value. And in the past 52 weeks, it’s up nearly 241%. However, in the trailing six months, shares have only moved up 18%. What does that tell us? Basically, like a fine-tuned athlete, incremental gains in performance are difficult to extract.', 'On the other hand, less-fancied chip stocks are like amateur athletes.

That could make Advanced Micro an intriguing idea for chip stocks to buy.', 'For one thing, the underlying generative AI market relevance has already been established. Plus, Advanced Micro has a knack for offering top-tier products at a discount to its rivals. Moving forward, a report by Bloomberg notes that the underlying sector could become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%.', 'In the spirit of full disclosure, AMD isn’t the cheapest of semiconductor stocks.

The company continues to demonstrate its financial prowess, with net revenues climbing to $8,634 million, up from $7,936 million in the same period last year. This growth is underpinned by a significant increase in net income, which rose to $4,890 million from $4,179 million, and an operating income jump to $5,954 million from $5,090 million. Visa's comprehensive income also saw a healthy increase to $5,552 million. These figures underscore Visa's robust financial position and its ability to generate shareholder value. The company's strategic acquisitions, such as the purchase of Pismo Holdings, signal a commitment to innovation and market expansion. As we delve into a SWOT analysis, these financial highlights will serve as a backdrop to understand Visa Inc's strategic position in the market."", ""Market Leadership and Brand Value: Visa Inc's dominant position in the global payments industry is one of its most formidable strengths. With a processing capability of over 65,000 transactions per second and operations in over 200 countries, Visa's brand is synonymous with reliability and security in electronic payments. The company's latest financial results, with net revenues of $8,634 million and a net income of $4,890 million, reflect its strong market presence and operational excellence. Visa's brand value not only attracts customers but also instills trust among its financial institution partners, merchants, and government entities."", ""Technological Infrastructure: Visa's technological infrastructure, VisaNet, is a cornerstone of its strength. It supports the vast volume of transactions processed by the company, showcasing both scalability and resilience. The recent acquisition of Pismo Holdings, a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform, for $1.0 billion, demonstrates Visa's commitment to maintaining its technological edge. This acquisition is poised to enhance Visa's digital offerings and expand its capabilities in the rapidly evolving fintech space."", ""Financial Health: Visa's financial health is robust, as evidenced by its strong balance sheet and impressive earnings performance. The company's basic earnings per share (EPS) for Class A common stock increased from $1.99 to $2.39 year-over-year, signaling healthy profitability. Furthermore, Visa's comprehensive income of $5,552 million, up from $5,289 million in the previous year, indicates solid financial stability and the ability to invest in growth opportunities."", ""Dependence on Consumer Spending: Visa's revenue is heavily reliant on consumer spending and the volume of transactions processed. While this has been a boon in times of economic prosperity, it also exposes the company to market downturns and shifts in consumer behavior. Economic uncertainties, such as inflation or recessionary pressures, could lead to reduced spending and impact Visa's revenue streams."", ""Regulatory Challenges: Visa operates in a highly regulated industry, and changes in regulations or compliance requirements can pose significant challenges. The company's ongoing legal matters, including various antitrust proceedings and litigation related to interchange fees, highlight the potential financial and reputational risks associated with regulatory scrutiny."", ""Competition and Market Saturation: The payment processing industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants offering innovative payment solutions. Visa's market leadership position could be challenged by these emerging players, especially in markets that are nearing saturation. To maintain its competitive edge, Visa must continue to innovate and adapt to changing market dynamics."", 'Expansion into Emerging Markets: Visa has significant opportunities to grow its footprint in emerging markets, where electronic payment adoption is still in its infancy. By leveraging its global brand and technological capabilities, Visa can tap into new customer segments and drive transaction volume growth.', ""Digital Payment Innovation: The shift towards digital payments presents a substantial opportunity for Visa. The company's investment in Pismo Holdings aligns with the trend of cloud-based financial services and positions Visa to capitalize on the growing demand for digital and mobile payment solutions."", ""Strategic Partnerships: Visa's ability to forge strategic partnerships with financial institutions, technology companies, and merchants can create new revenue streams and enhance its service offerings. Collaborations that leverage Visa's payment network can lead to the development of innovative products and services, further solidifying its market position."", ""Technological Disruptions: The rapid pace of technological innovation in the payments industry poses a threat to Visa's business model. Disruptive technologies, such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, could potentially bypass traditional payment networks, impacting Visa's transaction volumes and fee structures."", ""Geopolitical Tensions: Visa's global operations expose it to geopolitical risks, including trade disputes and sanctions. These tensions can disrupt cross-border transactions and affect the company's international business."", 'Data Security Concerns: As a payment processor, Visa is a target for cyber threats and data breaches. Any significant security incident could undermine consumer trust, result in substantial financial losses, and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny.', ""In conclusion, Visa Inc's latest 10-Q filing reveals a company with a strong financial foundation, marked by"", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

AmEx shares move higher after missing on earnings estimates, while Visa stock dips despite an earnings beat.', 'Lastly, shares of Spirit Airlines (SAVE) pullback after JetBlue Airways (JBLU) warned that it could back out of its merger with the discount operator ahead of the deal deadline.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Check out shares of Intel. They are in the red as the chipmaker's first-quarter guidance came in below expectations. You could see Intel getting shelled in today's trade, Julie, down about 12%. By the way, that stock is now down about 30% since Pat Gelsinger took charge as CEO. So Q4 results beat, but the focus is on that guide, the Q1 forecast, which was weak relative to consensus."", 'And just some puts and takes here to consider. The division that includes PC chips, that saw sales jump more than 30%. But the data center and AI segment, which is where Intel is really looking to take on Nvidia, the big player there, sales dropped 10%.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and just to put this in perspective again, as you talked about, yes, the stock is down since he took over again, but it is still up over the past year because hopes had been rising that he would be able to turn things around, that there would be a comeback for Intel, that it would be able to capitalize on the AI chip craze. So the shares are still up about 45% over the past year, even with today's decline, which is the largest single-day drop for the stock going back to July of 2020. So now the question is, Is this a fundamental hit to the optimism? or, Are we going to continue to see them recover in the coming months?"", ""The other measure that people were watching closely with Intel is its gross margin, which had regularly been around 60% if you look at a pre-2019 time frame. In the first quarter, it's going to be 44 and 1/2%. And the company is trying to work back to that gross-margin level where it was in the past, and obviously it still has some ways to go there as it does these efforts to start a foundry-- restart a foundry business and, indeed, capitalize on AI."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, we should mention, you know, Intel's Pat Gelsinger was on Yahoo Finance this morning saying the stock reaction today is an overreaction, in his opinion. He was talking about the tailwinds as he sees them-- the AI, PC, the improving product line. Told us the foundry business-- so making chips for others-- revenues will ramp in 2025 and beyond. But clearly investors, at least in today's trade, skeptical."", 'JULIE HYMAN: One of the people we both follow closely, Stacy Rasgon over at Bernstein. His title of his note today, ""How many times can you push the reset button?"" Talking about investors getting fatigued here.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Stacy pointing out the great Intel reset story probably just shifted again, in his opinion, to 2026.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Right. All right, let's talk about another duo of stocks that we are watching, payment companies going in opposite directions today. On the one hand, American Express in the green up about 7%. It missed on the top and bottom lines here, but the company did forecast earnings that are ahead of estimates."", ""And Visa on the flip side here despite an earnings beat. We're seeing some weak commentary from Wall Street analysts who are looking at a consumer slowdown, potentially, in January."", ""Let's talk AXP quickly here. Part of the reason it missed last quarter, it said, was because of the Argentina currency devaluation. So that might be part of the reason why investors are looking past."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, they said, listen, if it hadn't been for that, they said we would have beat."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Right, so maybe that's a little bit of the reason that investors are looking past those more negative numbers and bidding up the stock. And then Visa kind of the opposite situation there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and it was interesting comments from the American Express CEO talking to our own Brian Sozzi about the economy, saying, listen, I think it's slowing, he said, talking about the economy. And that's what's in our guidance, slightly lower economy, not a recession, he told Sozzi, but a slightly lower economy. And he was saying, listen, with our business model, we think we can perform even in that kind of environment, a slower-growth economy, sounding very confident there to Brian."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's interesting, though, on the Visa side because it does look like that a lot of the analysts were relatively positive in the commentary around the stock. But to your point, there is some concern over January numbers and how spending there is going to look and that there is a softish start to the second quarter, according to one analyst over at KeyBanc."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, I thought it was interesting on Visa. Dan Dolev over at Mizuho-- smart guy. We know him. Always one of those guys I pay attention to-- telling his clients on Visa, first quarter was strong, but he kind of did call out this softer-than-expected trends in January and higher opex guidance. So he's staying on neutral there."", ""And finally, check out shares of Spirit Airlines in the red as JetBlue could be walking away from their deal. In an SEC filing, JetBlue states that certain conditions of the deal require for closing may not be met in time. So you've got to-- this one you've got to follow the bouncing ball of this story. So Spirit really tanking here in today's trading. The news with JetBlue saying, OK, we might end this bid to buy the carrier. Of course, this comes after that judge blocked the deal, right?"", ""And JetBlue is now saying there are conditions to the deal that might not be met by the deadline in this agreement, and that could lead to termination, maybe as soon as this weekend, Julie. We don't know what terms exactly it sounds like they're being referred to here. But now Spirit then hitting back pretty hard and publicly. So a war of words beginning here."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and this is a change because both of them had been trying to fight the regulatory pressures on them to not get the deal done. Now they're turning on each other, and both of them have something to lose here. JetBlue will owe Spirit if the deal is blocked for antitrust reasons, but Spirit might owe JetBlue money also if the deal falls apart for other reasons."", ""So, you know, not-- they obviously have something to lose because they'll have to pay each other, but they'll also have something to lose because they were hoping to get stronger by teaming up here. You know, JetBlue was counting on getting those Spirit planes to try to increase its fleet. So it's definitely a messy situation."", ""JOSH LIPTON: I mean, Spirit at this point, you just kind of wonder what the options are because we've had financial analysts on our show who know the company really well, and they were talking about, you know, possible bankruptcy. So a story to keep watching."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, Frontier was out there before as a buyer too, but maybe they're not willing to step back in now that they've seen what has gone on.""]"

With many Latam countries having started an easing cycle, there are concerns that the returns on regional currencies could become less attractive, though some analysts see room for upside ahead. ""The recent repricing of market expectations on the Fed easing cycle beginning in May rather than March has cleaned up positioning and made LatAm markets more appealing,"" Societe Generale strategists said in a note, adding the dollar is likely to weaken ahead. ""Overall, we keep our stance of a buy on dips when volatility increases as we believe LatAm’s favourable fundamentals and technicals should keep the region’s FX and rates attractive."" Chile\'s peso dropped 1% while the Peruvian sol also weakened to 3.7809 per dollar, hurt by a dip in the prices of copper. Both countries are major exporters of the red metal. Also weighing on the peso were expectations of a 100 basis points rate cut by Chile\'s central bank next week. The Brazilian real edged up 0.1% in choppy trade after data showed domestic inflation came in well below market expectations, boosting bets of another 50 basis points rate cut at the central bank\'s meeting next week. The Bovespa index gained 0.4%. Brazilian airline Gol dropped 12.1%, a day after it filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. The Mexican peso and the Colombian peso were up 0.1% each. Equities in Chile and Mexico added 1.0% and 0.4% respectively. Argentina\'s MerVal index dropped 2.5%.

While some thought this may have been Nvidia's ceiling, that has been far from the truth. In just under a month in 2024, Nvidia has already risen 21%, giving the impression that 2024 could be a repeat year for the stock."", ""However, much of the optimism baked into the stock ignores an ugly truth about Nvidia that many people forget: It's a cyclical company. So, what can investors expect in the next few years? Let's take a look at what history says."", ""Nvidia has done so well over the past year because it makes the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) suited for artificial intelligence (AI). Originally, GPUs were created to improve gaming graphics, which required significant computing power. Soon, the use of GPUs for other arduous computing tasks like AI model training, engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mapping the human genome would be sped up by using hundreds or thousands of GPUs connected together."", ""Because of the AI arms race, many companies raced to build supercomputers to train their AI models. This fueled Nvidia's growth and resulted in Nvidia's revenue more than tripling year over year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023). However, many people forget that Nvidia was in a massive slump at the start of 2023, as its cyclical nature reared its head throughout 2022."", ""Another use for Nvidia's GPUs is cryptocurrency mining. This industry has had two major boom-and-bust cycles, one at the start of 2018 and the other during 2021. When crypto prices fall, mining cryptocurrency becomes unprofitable, as the input costs far outweigh the output. As a result, crypto miners don't purchase as many GPUs (or purchase none at all), which affects Nvidia's business significantly."", 'In the years following a crypto crash, Nvidia saw its revenue dip.', ""When Nvidia's revenue dips, it isn't optimized for profits, so its earnings fall even more dramatically."", ""So, what does this have to do with today's AI-fueled GPU purchasing?"", ""Because GPUs are hardware, they don't need to be purchased continually. While many companies are still outfitting their supercomputers, others have already built theirs."", ""Take Tesla's Dojo computer, for example. It required 10,000 H100 GPUs from Nvidia and likely cost more than $300 million in GPUs alone, with the average price of an H100 GPU being about $30,000. Will Tesla need to build another Dojo computer each year? Likely not."", ""This could cause Nvidia's downfall in the next few years: Customers won't need to buy GPUs continuously.\xa0However, the problem with this analysis is that I have no idea when this will occur or how low the demand will fall."", ""Nvidia's previous cyclical declines only brought the revenue down around 20%. If Nvidia is still slated to double from its current levels, then even if business falls 20% once demand has been satisfied, the stock still has room for more upside. On the other hand, if the business will fall 20% from current levels, the stock is currently overvalued."", 'Additionally, 20% may be a conservative number, as once these companies build out their infrastructure, they may be set for many years.', ""I have no idea when Nvidia's business will top out and how far it will go when business declines. But I know that it's coming. With how fully valued the company is today (160 times earnings), investors need to be careful if they're taking a position in the stock at today's prices."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

So there's reason right now to load up on stocks that may excel in this sort of environment and benefit from the momentum."", ""That's why I've got my eye on companies involved in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI) from chipmakers that power AI tools to companies using this technology to improve their operations.

Companies investing now could greatly benefit down the road -- and so could you. Here are my top-five AI growth stocks to buy hand over fist for 2024."", 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is almost synonymous with AI these days. The company\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) power the training of AI systems, the ""deep learning"" that allows them to understand complex concepts and deliver answers to our questions.', 'Nvidia has built an 80%-to-95% share of the AI chip market, according to analysts, and that\'s unlikely to change any time soon for two reasons. First, Nvidia now is a clear leader, so it may be difficult for rivals to attract customers away from the industry\'s ""go-to"" chipmaker. Second, Nvidia invests heavily in research and development (R&D), so it should stay ahead thanks to innovation too. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia\'s R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion.', ""Importantly, Nvidia's investments are bearing fruit, with return on invested capital soaring in recent times."", 'NVDA Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.', ""Nvidia's revenue has climbed over the past few years as it broadened its dominance from GPUs to power gaming and graphics to leadership in AI. And the company's profit has advanced too. Considering Nvidia's financial strength and AI market share, the stock is a no-brainer AI buy right now."", ""AI is helping Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) excel in both its e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses. The company has used AI in e-commerce for a while now, in everything from making warehouse operations and fulfillment more efficient to helping you, the customer, find just the right item. So, here, AI helps Amazon gain in efficiency, thereby lowering costs. By offering you a positive shopping experience, you're likely to come back. That's a double victory for Amazon's earnings."", 'As for cloud computing, Amazon has developed several AI tools that it offers its customers. For example, Amazon Bedrock gives clients access to top foundation models they can customize for their own use -- without having to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also offers Code Whisperer, a service that suggests code to developers, saving them valuable time.', 'Generative AI is ""top of mind"" for clients, Amazon said in its recent earnings call, so AWS, as the world\'s cloud-market leader, is in the perfect place to benefit in the years to come.', ""Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of AI. After all, it's a biotech developing vaccines based on mRNA technology. But Moderna actually could be a winner of the AI revolution and is investing in the technology today to increase its chances of that happening."", 'Moderna uses AI across its entire business, even launching an ""AI academy"" to train employees. But where AI really might change the game is in the area of drug development.', ""Moderna applies AI to explore relationships between the vast amounts of data it's collected over the years to produce better candidates. The company even signed a collaboration with International Business Machines (IBM) last year to use its AI tools. For example, an IBM foundation model can help predict a molecule's properties, helping scientists immediately understand the characteristics of a potential medicine."", 'The idea is AI can help Moderna more quickly identify the best candidates, and that may speed up the drug-development process, bringing products to market faster. This could score a win for Moderna, patients, and investors.', 'Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is another potential winner in the AI-in-healthcare market -- a market expected to reach $208 billion in 2030 from $32 billion today, according to Grand View Research. Like Moderna, Medtronic has put the focus on this hot technology, creating an AI Center of Excellence.', ""The medical device giant created the center of excellence to cost-effectively drive AI innovation across its businesses with the goal of maintaining leadership in AI-enabled healthcare. Medtronic already uses AI across many of its products from the GI Genius endoscopy tool to the Touch Surgery Enterprise platform for AI-enabled surgery. So, it's well on the way to being a major player in the AI-in-healthcare revolution."", ""On top of this, you'll like the fact that Medtronic, following a transformation plan to become more efficient, may be heading into a new era of growth. In the most recent quarter, Medtronic reported growth across its business segments and geographies. Considering Medtronic's products hold Nos. 1 to 3 market-share positions, this performance may continue over time."", 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), parent of search giant Google, already has delivered an impressive track record of growth, as seen in the chart below.', 'GOOG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.', ""Now, AI may be set to deliver a new boost. Your searches on Google are about to garner even better results thanks to Alphabet's focus on this potentially game-changing technology. Alphabet recently unveiled its most powerful AI tool yet, Gemini, and tests of Gemini in search have resulted in improvements in quality and speed."", ""Why is this important? Google holds more than 90% of the search market right now, making it the leader by far. Supercharging Google search's capabilities should reinforce this leadership. That, in turn, should keep advertisers flocking to Google. Since this is Alphabet's biggest source of revenue, keeping Google search at the top of its game is crucial."", ""Alphabet plans on applying Gemini across its products, from its smartphone to its cloud-computing offerings, so this investment in AI should go pretty far when it comes to driving growth.

In fact, the AI chipmaker saw its share price climbed 239%, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023. Nvidia has already advanced another 20% in 2024, but Wall Street now sees more upside in other AI stocks.', 'To elaborate, Nvidia has a median analyst price target of $650 per share, implying a 9% upside. But The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) has a median price target of $83 per share, implying 20% upside. And Docebo (NASDAQ: DCBO) has a median price target of $56 per share, implying 24% upside.', ""Here's what investors should know about these two AI stocks."", 'The Trade Desk operates the largest independent ad tech platform for media buyers. Its software leans on artificial intelligence (AI) to help advertisers create, measure, and optimize campaigns across digital channels. The Trade Desk is the market leader in connected TV (CTV) advertising, and the company is quickly gaining clout in offsite retail media, the two fastest-growing segments of the broader digital advertising market.', ""One reason The Trade Desk has been so successful is its independent business model, meaning it doesn't own media that could bias ad spending, nor does it compete with publishers by selling ad inventory. Publishers are more willing to share data with noncompetitors like The Trade Desk as opposed to fellow publishers like Alphabet, a company that monetizes media properties like Google Search and YouTube with advertising."", 'Because of a unique combination of independence and scale, The Trade Desk has won numerous partners of import. It sources data and inventory from most major CTV publishers, including Walt Disney, and it sources data from many leading retailers including Walmart. As such, The Trade Desk provides measurement capabilities that media buyers cannot find on other ad tech platforms.', 'One corollary of robust and unique data is differentiated AI. To that end, Morgan Stanley sees The Trade Desk as one of 11 companies best positioned to benefit from AI, and consultancy Quadrant Knowledge Solutions sees The Trade Desk as the most technologically sophisticated ad tech platform on the market, outranking even Google.', 'Looking ahead, ad tech spending is forecasted to grow at 14% annually through 2030, but The Trade Desk should outpace the industry given its strong market position. Indeed, Wall Street is projecting annual sales growth of 21% over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 19.4 times sales is tolerable. Patient investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.', 'Docebo operates a learning management system. Its platform comprises several applications that help businesses create, deliver, and measure the impact of training content across internal employees and external audiences. Two applications are particularly noteworthy because they demonstrate a proclivity for innovation and they present sizable growth opportunities.', 'Docebo Shape uses generative AI to automate content creation, turning source material like documents, presentations, and case studies into corporate training material. Docebo Flow embeds learning content into other software products, which lends itself to external use cases like customer training. For instance, Flow lets businesses embed learning into customer-facing applications for the purpose of educating new users.', 'Docebo gained a strong market presence through consistent innovation. European industry analyst Fosway Group has recognized its leadership in learning management systems for six straight years. In addition, Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer selected Docebo stock as a top generative AI pick in 2024. He said the company is not just disrupting the market for internal learning, but also leading the market in external use cases.', 'Docebo is an unfamiliar name for many investors, but the company has landed several big customers, including two of the five largest technology companies in the world. The first is Amazon and the second is unnamed, but all evidence points to Google.', 'Meanwhile, Docebo has also partnered with Google Cloud to further its generative AI product roadmap. New features are coming to Shape in 2024, including virtual role play with real-time feedback and an integrated copilot that simplifies learning content creation. Management says ""Shape will fundamentally change how training material is created and consumed.""', 'With that in mind, the learning management systems market is forecasted to grow at 20% annually through 2030, and Wall Street expects Docebo to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years. That consensus forecast makes its current valuation of 9 times sales look downright cheap. The market is overlooking this little-known software stock, creating a fabulous buying opportunity for patient investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?', 'Before you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and The Trade Desk wasn't one of them.

Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it\'s one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the ""short-termism"" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.', '""You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.""', 'But how does Gabelli find ""specific stocks"" to invest in? GAMCO in a report highlighted that instead of always focusing on short-term earnings cycles and news, it focuses on true value of companies and positions itself for long-term earnings trends.', '""We want to know everything and anything that will add to, or detract from, our valuation estimates. This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price.

And according to analyst projections, this booming market has plenty of room left to run. That said, the company could find even more synergistic growth drivers over the long term. Let's dig deeper into what the next 10 years could hold. "", 'When Nvidia was founded in 1993, it would have been hard to imagine that the hardware it was pioneering, the graphics processing unit (GPU), would have such a transformative effect on the technology landscape. ', 'Originally designed to render video-game visuals, GPUs work through parallel processing, which involves computing multiple tasks simultaneously. This functionality made them extremely useful for new uses like cryptocurrency mining and training the large language models (LLM) behind generative AI applications.', ' For Nvidia, these trends have transformed its operations. As of the third quarter, data center chip sales (such as the AI-capable H100) make up 80% of revenue, while its previously core gaming business has fallen to just under 16%. ', 'With industry experts expecting the market for AI chips to rise to $400 billion by 2027, Nvidia has plenty of room for near-term growth by selling its hardware. But the company will almost certainly face rising competition, which could eventually erode its market share and margins. To keep delivering market-beating growth, Nvidia may have to reinvent itself once again -- and management looks capable of pulling it off. ', 'The tech industry has several hardware companies that transitioned to more software-dependent business models to protect their economic moats and stabilize revenue streams. One of the best examples is Apple, which used sales of its industry-leading iPhones to drive iOS and app store adoption. According to analysts at Melius Research, Nvidia could be on the cusp of a similar move as it pivots to software and services. ', 'Nvidia has long relied on custom software to help data center clients make the most of their GPU-based systems. But over time, this business could become a core growth driver in its own right. ', ""Nvidia has launched a new AI supercomputer called DGX Cloud, which uses cutting-edge hardware to allow enterprise clients to build and deploy customized AI models without having to create their own data center infrastructure. Naturally, this move will bring the chipmaker into competition with traditional cloud service providers like Amazon AWS and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, Nvidia's technical lead designing the GPUs that run these platforms gives it a competitive edge to rapidly scale this new growth driver. "", ""With a market cap around $1.50 trillion, Nvidia is already the sixth most valuable company in the world. And it probably isn't a coincidence that three of the companies above it (Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon) attained their position by transitioning away from only physical products into software. Over the next 10 years, Nvidia has significant growth potential, and I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually overtakes some of its large rivals. "", ""While shares have already risen 211% over the last 12 months, the company still boasts a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30, which is in line with the NASDAQ 100 average. That means it isn't too late for investors to bet on Nvidia's long-term success.

Southeastern Asset Management hunts for bottom-up opportunities around the globe, with the fund\'s core value and investing philosophy finding its roots in Benjamin Graham\'s value investing approach. Hawkins is among the traditional class of value investors who staunchly stick to age-old, tried and tested value investing principles. Back in 2008, Hawkins was asked during an interview how he examines intrinsic value of companies. The billionaire said he focuses on free cash flow as he and his team tries to project FCF for the next seven years, ""put a low or no growth terminal multiple on the business past 7 years, and discount back at a conservative discount rate.""', '""The second method calculates net asset value by adjusting book values of assets and liabilities to current liquidation values. (For example, real estate is rarely worth the original cost carried on the books, particularly if it’s been held for a long period.) Third, we check our longhand math against a data base of comparable transactions over the last 30 years, taking into account the interest rate environment at the time of the transactions. We mark our appraisal to the lower of the two values when comparable sales and our longhand math differ,"" Hawkins added.', 'Longleaf Partners Fund, where Hawkins is a co-portfolio manager, is also a notable fund backed by Southeastern and regularly posts its performance and commentary on its website. The fund said in its Q4\'2023 letter that it more than doubled the Russell 1000 Value Index, ""almost equalled the tech-led S&P 500 Index and approximately doubled"" its absolute return goal of inflation plus 10%.

At the start of the year when everyone was still predicting an imminent recession, we saw opportunity as contrarians and improved our portfolio with weighting changes and compelling new investments, many of which have already contributed to the portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have seen a growing consensus about a soft landing. This consensus view concerns us for the same reasons we were excited to be buying earlier in the year when everyone was fearful. However, we are confident in our ability to keep delivering double-digit returns with our portfolio of competitively advantaged, financially strong businesses with management teams that can take self-help measures in any environment. 2023 showed us that our investment approach can add meaningful value, even in a challenging period for bottom-up active equity managers.""', 'Methodology', ""For this article we scanned billionaire Mason Hawkins' Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current prices based on average analyst price estimates.

Fiserv has two businesses that reinforce each other: it is a key technology provider to several thousand global banks and credit unions. Mid-sized financial institutions need to offer a full complement of digital banking services to compete with larger national banks, but they can’t afford to build out an internal tech capacity. It’s more cost effective to outsource to Fiserv.', 'Fiserv’s other business is, broadly, payment processing: when you tap and pay at your favorite restaurant or retailer, you may be using a Fiserv device. That device, in turn, may connect directly to the business owner’s bank – and Fiserv built out the bank’s tech stack. The synergy here is important. Fiserv can sell terminals to the restaurant itself, but banks may also sell Fiserv products as part of their customer relationships. There is terrific distribution synergy', 'For the next few years, Fiserv’s growth should be led by Clover, a payments acceptance system that offers merchants faster transaction times, better fraud protection and stronger operational controls than many existing acceptance networks. While Clover is a clear leader in acceptance, it has a small market share today and could grow at double digit rates for some years. In turn, that should drive solid earnings growth for Fiserv.

The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently.

Graphics specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has played a starring role in this surge as its shares have shot up a whopping 233% during this period, driven by the company's rock-solid position in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips."", ""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have witnessed massive demand thanks to their ability to train large language models (LLMs), which form the backbone of popular applications such as ChatGPT. The price of each AI-focused GPU that Nvidia sells can range from $10,000 to $30,000. It is worth noting that the company reportedly makes a profit of almost 1,000% on these chips, according to investment banking firm Raymond James."", ""The market for AI chips is set to grow rapidly in the future and Nvidia is in the pole position to capitalize on its growth, but Citi analyst Atif Malik believes that Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) could be a better semiconductor pick than Nvidia. Let's see why."", ""The Citi analyst maintained his buy rating on Marvell stock and pointed out that the company is well placed to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI chips and its optical modules that enable high-speed communication between data centers. Malik, however, is not the only one upbeat about Marvell's prospects."", ""Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer is predicting an acceleration in Marvell's sales this year thanks to its AI exposure, pointing out that the company's data center storage and switching solutions will witness stronger demand. Schafer believes that Marvell stands to gain from multiple new product cycles and potential content gains, which explains why the analyst has an outperform rating on the stock."", 'A closer look at the semiconductor solutions that Marvell provides will tell us just why Wall Street is upbeat about the company\'s AI-related prospects.

The reason why these major AI players are developing custom AI chips is that they can help them derive more performance and power efficiency. That's not surprising as ASICs are programmed to run specific workloads and perform dedicated operations, and they can help accelerate AI training and inference models as a result."", ""Morgan Stanley estimates that ASICs could account for 30% of the overall AI chip market by 2027, which the investment bank believes could be worth $182 billion then. So, the market for AI-focused ASICs could be worth almost $55 billion a year in 2027 based on Morgan Stanley's estimates.

Assuming Marvell can hold on to this share in 2027 and the market for AI-focused ASICs indeed hits $55 billion, the company is looking at an additional $6.6 billion in AI-related revenue. That would be a big jump over Marvell's current quarterly revenue run rate of $200 million from AI-driven chip sales, as well as the potential $1 billion revenue that the company could generate from this market in fiscal 2025 (which will begin at the end of this month)."", ""Analysts are predicting Marvell's top-line growth to accelerate following a 7% decline in fiscal 2024 to $5.5 billion, jumping to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2025 and $7.3 billion in 2026.

Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it\'s one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the ""short-termism"" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.', '""You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.""', 'But how does Gabelli find ""specific stocks"" to invest in? GAMCO in a report highlighted that instead of always focusing on short-term earnings cycles and news, it focuses on true value of companies and positions itself for long-term earnings trends.', '""We want to know everything and anything that will add to, or detract from, our valuation estimates. This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.""', ""In another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations.

This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction.

Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers.

While the market overall is growing well of late, some individual growth stocks are still trading at low valuations that could set the stage for big returns over the next few years.', ""Let's find out why three Motley Fool contributors believe Toast (NYSE: TOST), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), and Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) are due for a rally in the new year."", ""Jennifer Saibil (Toast): It's hard to find great early-stage opportunities. Investors often pounce on great stocks before the general public has a chance to hear about an initial public offering, and top stocks can reach high valuations before they hit many people's radars. So when a great stock's price tanks, it can be a blessing in disguise."", ""That's what's been happening with Toast. Toast is a catchy name for a disruptive tech stock in the restaurant industry. That may not be the place investors expect to find the next big thing, but Toast is making waves with its software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that exclusively serves the restaurant industry. It has set out to distinguish itself as a leader by focusing on one specific niche and offering the most comprehensive suite of solutions to fill that niche, with any kind of hardware or software a client could need."", ""It has been reporting incredible growth despite the sour economic climate. Annualized recurring revenue increased 40% year over year in the 2023 third quarter, and it added more than 6,000 new locations in the quarter for a total of 99,000. If that sounds like a lot, it's still a small percentage of what it perceives as its serviceable addressable market today, and a tiny fraction of the overall global restaurant industry, where it envisions expanding."", 'However, Toast is one of those high-growth, unprofitable tech stocks that investors have grown wary of. Although gross profit increased 50% year over year in the third quarter, and net loss was about a third of what it was in 2022, the loss still came in at $31 million.', 'With the bull market of the past 15 months now officially recognized, investors who have been waiting on the sidelines tend to grow more favorable toward these kinds of stocks, and they could finally embrace Toast stock. Toast is down 21% over the past year, but it reports fourth-quarter earnings in February. It trades at a price-to-sales ratio of only 2.5, a cheap valuation for high-growth status, and if it reports solid results, Toast stock could skyrocket.', ""Jeremy Bowman (Disney): It's no secret that Disney stock has been volatile over the past couple of years. Part of the entertainment giant's issues recently revolve around its sluggish reaction to the shift to streaming, and its efforts to play catch-up have weighed on the bottom line. Its streaming division has been generating losses and profits from its linear TV business have been quickly drying up."", 'However, Disney appears to finally be turning the corner. Management has said that its streaming division will be profitable by September 2024, or the end of this fiscal year, but that could happen sooner as the company raised prices on its streaming services significantly in October 2023. Prices for the ad-free version of Disney+ rose from $11 a month to $14 a month, while the ad-supported plan stayed at $8 a month.', 'That strategy worked well for Netflix, which just reported its strongest quarter of fourth-quarter subscriber growth ever and has seen strong adoption for its ad-based tier.', ""Meanwhile, Disney appears to be making moves to leverage some of its linear media assets. It's held talks with the NFL about taking a stake in ESPN. It's also received interest in ABC and its cable channels from buyers, and it's in the process of merging its Indian TV entertainment business with Reliance Industries, a local company. Any of those moves would likely boost investor confidence in the business and should help lift the stock price."", ""Finally, Disney's theme parks business remains a fast-growing cash cow, and the company said it would nearly double its capital spending on its theme parks over the next decade, which should drive profits higher."", ""Disney has a lot of upside potential if it can show that it's able to deliver steady bottom-line growth, and that could start in its first-quarter earnings report in February."", ""John Ballard (Coupang): eMarketer expects the $5.7 trillion e-commerce market to grow to $8 trillion by 2027, making it a ripe field to look for winners in the next bull market. If you're going to buy a growth stock hand over fist, lots of growth isn't enough. You should look for companies that are turning a profit, are leading their respective market, and can grow for a long time. South Korea's popular online retailer Coupang fits this criteria perfectly. It's a bonus that the stock trades at a cheap valuation."", ""Coupang's WOW membership service offers customers free shipping and content streaming, which is a page taken right out of Amazon's playbook, and it's reporting similar results. Revenue growth accelerated in 2023, with third-quarter revenue up 21% year over year, but it's got a long runway of growth."", ""With only a single-digit share of the total retail market, Coupang can grow at high rates for a long time. More importantly, it's a profitable business generating $1.9 billion in free cash flow. The company has ample resources to invest in expanding its selection to win a greater share of retail spending."", 'The future for this fast-growing e-commerce company is bright. The best part is that investors can buy the stock at a cheap price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.1, a big margin of safety compared to the P/S multiple of 2.6 for the average stock in the S&P 500 index.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Toast right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Toast, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Toast wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

That's some pretty heavy hitters in the entertainment industry from traditional media, like Paramount Global, to some of those publications and newspapers, like Sports Illustrated and the LA Times, are going through layoffs or at least some of these companies hinting that layoffs are going to be coming down the pipeline. And it seems like the reckoning that we saw really throughout 2023 is continuing in 2024."", ""Across the board, a lot of these companies have been trying to right size their businesses, trying to reduce headcount, reduce the amount of money that they're spending, because, at the end of the day, streaming is not still profitable. You have the advertising environment. That is just not getting better. That's hammering these cable companies."", ""And the background of that, you have M&A chatter, so there's a lot of offloading and divesting those non-core assets. And I just wonder what this means as we head deeper into 2024 and really what the future of the industry looks like, because it's certainly going through a big shift."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: The ad market comments interesting, because you think about a company like Netflix, who has had better margins. And part of what they've been able to do was add that ad to your, right? Some of these companies don't fully have that option because they already rely on advertisements a significant amount. I'm thinking of YouTube, and I'm thinking of paramount. They already have arms that build off ads. So it's sort of where else can you cut costs, because you can't maybe get topline hire. And it comes down to headcount at some point."", ""The other thing, Brooke, is just a lot of these companies are paying a lot for content, right? At some point, if you're paying $1 billion to get NFL Sunday Ticket, you're going to probably need to cut costs somewhere else. And you probably need Sunday Ticket to get people on the platform. So I get the spend. But obviously, that comes with a cost somewhere else."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And it seems like that's exactly the narrative across, not just the media industry, but really across multiple different sectors. We're talking retail industry like Levi's, tech industry like Salesforce. We're also looking at Microsoft, Wayfair. It's really this reallocation of resources that we're seeing, where they're really prioritizing, where the future of the business is going and where employees different needs, different desires, different skill sets are really needed."", ""And we saw that most recently, like I said, with Levi's with Microsoft. They did let go or hint towards letting go 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees really as M&A happens, as they're really looking where they need that skill set. And it seems like that's going to be a common theme in 2024 as well."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: I think, yeah. And when you zoom out, think about how quickly we hired after the pandemic, right? You lose-- I think it was about 20 million jobs in April 2020 in one month alone. And then you have to rehire a lot of these people. And not necessarily that they work for the specific companies that were mentioned but the labor force as a whole, right?', ""And when you're doing that rush to hire, you're overpaying probably, you're trying to train talent quickly. And then I think you pick your head up two or three years later and you go, OK, who do we hire? Who we hire? What divisions do we create?

Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher."", 'John Faucher', ""Thanks, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q4 and full year 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q4 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q4 and full year results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong finish to a very good year in 2023 and our positive outlook for 2024. Over the past 2 years, we have been particularly focused on sustaining our strong organic sales growth, while rebuilding our margins and improving our cash flow performance. We deliver on all 3 of those goals this year while still investing behind advertising to strengthen our brands and building and scaling capabilities to deliver future growth. 2023 marked our fifth consecutive year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range. We delivered balanced organic sales growth, growth in all 6 divisions, all 4 of our categories and with improved balance between pricing and volume as we exited the year. Volume rounded to flat in the fourth quarter and was up for the quarter, excluding the impact of lower private label volumes at Hill's. Our market share momentum is improving behind strong innovation, higher levels of brand investment with a focus on improving the effectiveness of each dollar spent. We are also seeing the benefits of our digital transformation as our efforts with data analytics continue to proceed. Our commitment to revenue growth management and the strength of our funding to growth efforts, combined with our global productivity initiative drove gross margin expansion, double-digit base business operating profit growth and high single-digit base business EPS growth. We delivered these results while increasing the investment in marketing and strategic capabilities and absorbing the headwinds from higher interest expense, pension and tax. We drove greater than 60% free cash flow growth, allowing us to invest behind our brands, increase capacity and buy back stock. We also increased our dividend for the 61st consecutive year. I am deeply proud of the results Colgate people have delivered in a challenging operating environment. 2024 will offer many of the same challenges as 2023, geopolitical unrest, foreign exchange headwinds and a challenged consumer, continued softness in China and a large number of political elections around the world. We enter 2024 with strong momentum and the plans in place to deliver in this environment as well as greater flexibility in both our income statement and our balance sheet. As we have mentioned over the past few quarters, we're focused on returning to consistent compounded EPS growth and our 2024 guidance reflects this ambition. We will continue to invest to drive high-quality balanced organic sales growth in with both volume and pricing growing. We plan to deliver on productivity to fund this incremental investment while growing earnings per share. This should enable us to deliver strong cash flow growth to invest back in the business and return cash to shareholders. I look forward to discussing our 2024 plans in further detail at CAGNY next month, so you can share the confidence the Colgate-Palmolive team has in our continued growth. And with that, I'll take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.', 'Dara Warren Mohsenian', ""So just wanted to focus on market share results in Q4. And as you look ahead, Oral Care share was obviously strong again and you delivered healthy expansion for the full year. Can you just talk about your forward positioning on the share front in Oral Care. You've got a tougher comparison here. So how do you think about the sustainability of those share gains as you look out to 2024 and then a similar question on Pet. Obviously, some industry pressure points, can you sort of juxtapose your market share relative to those industry pressure points? And if the unlocked capacity is a significant driver of market share opportunity longer term in that business?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Great. Dara, thank you. So let me start a little bit broader on the categories, particularly Oral Care, we're really encouraged to see the inflection of positive volume growth in the categories around the world. And in many of the regions where we had seen negative volume growth, we started to see an inflection of that towards the end of the fourth quarter in the category. So that gives us great confidence that the category and the pricing that we put in place is continuing to turn. And importantly, we're going to see that growth continue in 2024. As you bring that back to our business, a really strong quarter for Oral Care, as you mentioned, both from an organic and sales standpoint, but likewise, has that transferred into better market share growth?If I take oral care in general, we were up double digits in the quarter. That translated into strong market share growth, particularly in regions like Latin America, Europe, Africa, Eurasia, and you saw some improved scanner data in the U.S. as well. I think this is a reflection of the core business strategy that we have in place, the increased advertising that we're putting behind the business as well as a strong innovation pipeline that continued in the back half of 2023 and will continue in 2024 as well. So market shares around the world is strong, and we would anticipate that, that will see continued growth as we move through the balance of '24. And I would caveat with some of that, obviously, the markets will be challenged given some of the upfront issues I mentioned but pleasing to see the strong volume growth in some of our bigger regions. If you take Latin America, particularly 3 strong quarters of strong volume growth very much driven by Oral Care. But quite frankly, that was a cross-section of all of our categories, and you see that volume improving across all of our divisions. So again, I think we're well positioned on that. Let me talk a little bit about Pet because I think there's some important context to our strategy and why what we're doing is different for the market and what we're doing is working for the marketplace as well. We talked about Colgate being the most penetrated brand in the world. We also know that Hill's is low penetration. So we will continue to execute a series of differentiated strategies on Hill's in order to continue to accelerate our growth on that business. So if I take the 3 aspects that we think about for Hill's, reach, awareness and conversion. Reach, obviously, is a reflection of the strong advertising that we're putting in place to get the message out with low single-digit penetration on Hill's. We want to ensure the awareness of our superior science is well understood. Hence, the strategy to drive more TV spending, more digital spending through consistently through the quarters. We're spending a lot of time on the effectiveness of that reach to ensure that we're getting the awareness of it. We're using obviously, a strong professional endorsement that we have behind vets and continue to accelerate our science and our clinical communication with that key opinion new leader is critical to the success of the brand and importantly, as we think about conversion, a lot of nonusers in the category, as I mentioned, I think, on the third quarter call, 5% of consumers are using a therapeutic nutrition, but theoretically, 80% should be using the therapeutic nutrition. So a lot of opportunity to continue to drive share. The dynamics in the category hence, you're seeing a little bit of trade down from wet into dry. I mentioned that on the third quarter call, treats have suffered. Now we're not immune to the category softness but if you take a step back and look at our principal retail environments, Pet specialty, neighborhood Pet, we're growing share nicely across all of those environments, which means we're helping our retail partners grow category dollars. Penetration was up roughly 10% in the U.S., our biggest and largest market. So we're very pleased with the progress we have there. Yes, the category is a little softer, but we have the right strategies and differentiated strategies in place to continue to accelerate growth."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.', 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', ""Maybe this question both for Noel and Stan, just related to Argentina, I think there was maybe a write-down that ran through the other expense line. So if you could give us a little bit more color on that and how much of that may recur. And maybe, Noel, just kind of stepping back, I think this week, we've heard from several other companies who may be even rethinking how they approach Argentina, given the devaluation. It's been a while, right? Since we've had this kind of currency crisis in Latin America. So I don't know, just your perspective, both short term, how we should be thinking about it from accounting perspective stand? And then, Noel, just how you're thinking about Argentina maybe longer term."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Okay. Great. Bryan. Let me talk again a little bit of history in Argentina, and I apologize to go down with an extended answer, but I think it's important for the audience to understand how we operate in these hyper inflationary environments. We've been in Argentina close to 100 years. We have an extraordinarily capable management team that understands hyperinflationary accounting, understands how to manage the income statement and the balance sheet, understands how to prevent further devaluations on the balance sheet as we move forward. And that's a reflection of just years and years of experience dealing with this level of volatility. We can go back to 2001, 2002, which I think was the last major devaluation in the country 2014 had one as well. So we're very accustomed to ensuring we're doing everything to manage the potential volatility in a market like Argentina, and that experience has certainly played out. We have always, always continued to invest for the long term in Argentina. We have manufacturing on the ground. We have good relationships in terms of our ability to access dollars. But importantly, given some of the limitations that we've seen over the years on the ability to access dollars, we now have flexibility in the business to import product into the country as well. So we're very attuned to the volatility I would say, on the flip side, good news that price control seemed to have been settled a bit, and we're not going to see as much of those moving forward. So we continue to operate in an environment where we can bring value to the consumer and take pricing in order to offset some of the significant transaction. Now we're not immune to the devaluation. We'll see that ultimately unfold as we go through the next couple of quarters, more on the margin line than the profit line. But ultimately, we will make sure we get pricing in the market, and that will sit -- take some time to flow through into the P&L. But overall, experienced team, which I want to thank for their incredible diligence in how they deal with the economic environment there and feel pretty good that we've got real control of what's going on in Argentina, notwithstanding there will be continued volatility. So with that, let me give Stan a chance to talk a little bit about how we're managing more closely the income statement."", 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""Thanks, Noel. And Bryan, let me start and pick up where Noel left off on the team. So as an example, we have a gentleman that I work with, Jose Fernando, and he is my CFO for Latin America. But he was also the CFO or the Finance Director in Argentina in 2002. So we have a depth of experience. And I think that manifests itself with a very proactive approach to market conditions. So he and I talk on a very regular basis about changing market conditions and then more importantly, the proactive nature of what we do about that. So they've operated in a hyperinflationary environment for a very long time. They take the actions necessary where we look at the long term. So while we operate hyperinflationary environment, we account for it appropriately, you do see the impact of the devaluation and other income, other expense it was not the majority of that line item. So there are other items in there. But we dealt with that. We delivered our overall numbers. We improved our productivity. We delivered margin expansion, profit expansion and cash flow so I think the team has done a very nice job looking at it proactively and dealing with it decisively. So you mentioned on a go-forward basis. Obviously, when you deval, your balance sheet gets smaller, we'll continue to take those actions going forward. We have a growing business there. So going forward, I would not anticipate a major impact to our results from Argentina."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""I was wondering if you can talk, Noel, a little bit more about marketing investments, and you elaborated just recently that you mentioned increased market advertising -- and are you also seeing a normalizing promotional environment in the past, you had said that you dialed down and you're reinvesting advertising promotional capabilities in the U.S. Can you comment on how you stand right now and how the category promotional levels are? And separately, if you can talk a bit about the supply chain changes that you implemented with the new leadership and also how you're positioning in light of the disruptions in the Middle East and the learnings from the panic."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Great. Andrea. So let me take the advertising and promotional piece, and I'll come back and add a little bit of context on some of the great work that Luciano has done as he's come into the new role. The strategy has been quite consistent for the last 3 to 4 years about our ability to drive -- build brands through great communication and great innovation. And you've seen that obviously flow through the P&L. And despite the fact that we have obviously grown and accelerated advertising meaningfully over the last couple of years, we've continued to deliver against our guidance and exceed our operating profit objectives, which is terrific. But that just gives you a sense for the health of the P&L today and our ability to continue to fund investment going forward, and that will clearly be our strategy. Now likewise, it gives us flexibility to be very focused on the efficiency of that spend. And I can assure you there's not a discussion that goes by where we don't talk about reach and frequency and the ROI associated with our spend both at the digital level and the linear TV level. So we're very, very, very focused on the ability to drive more efficiency through the P&L as we accelerate our advertising. And as we said in the prepared comments, we anticipate to continue to accelerate the advertising into 2024. Promotional environment is very constructive right now. I would say it's about 75% to 80% of the pre-COVID levels. So it's come down. It's more moderated. We -- as I've mentioned, in second and third quarter calls that we will be very selective on increasing the cadence of our promotions in some of the geographies where we may have taken a little bit too much pricing as we led in some of those markets that will be prudent and thoughtful and focused in certain select markets. But overall, the promotional environment seems very constructive. And our objective is to drive category and healthy volume growth through obviously the accelerated advertising line. On the supply chain, Luciano has come in and really thinking about the continued transformation of that, bringing a lot of good ideas on automation and data analytics and driving network optimization. A lot of our focus over the last couple of years, particularly at Hill's was increasing capacity, and you saw that through our capital expenditure line. That will moderate as we move forward with some more spending being allocated towards efficiency and savings and optimizing the network and very much digitizing the supply chain and getting very aggressive on using data analytics to optimize our efficiency and our case field level. So overall, pleased with where he's taking the group and that team has done just an extraordinary job getting us ready for further optimization moving forward."", 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""And Andrea, I'll just pick up on your last comment around the issues out in the Red Sea and the shipping. So we've been also proactive on that, looking at alternate methods where available, planning for the lead time disruption. And the rest of the supply chain has remained stable, so we don't see issues there but we have anticipated longer lead times and planned appropriately for 2024."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', ""So Noel, going back to Health, clearly, high single-digit top line growth, excluding the private label, discontinuation, very strong results in the quarter. As you think about '24, like, can you give us a sense of how you see the volume for that business evolving and also the pricing environment in Pet food? And then at the margin line, you saw a pretty significant cost headwinds in 2023. Are you seeing any moderation on the cultural and protein side for the Hill's business?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Filippo. We see more balanced volume and price as we move into 2024. Obviously, we've had roughly 6 quarters of aggressive pricing 7 quarters where we've had to take pricing to offset a lot of the inflation that we've seen in agricultural products. To get to your second part of your question, we do see ag prices beginning to moderate, which is good, which over time, as we see the pricing settle out in the markets, we anticipate that volume will come back. But remember, this is the one category we compete in where we've seen prolonged inflation as we move through the back half of 2023. But we anticipate that will definitely moderate as we move into 2024, and pricing likewise, will moderate, and we'll see a return to really continuing to drive that successful household penetration number that I shared with you earlier which is obviously our ability to continue to support strong advertising. So overall, we'll see that more balanced growth as we move through 2024. And on the margin line, as I mentioned again, a more moderating cost. We're still lapping some of the strong inflationary environments that we had in the first half of last year. So that pricing that we've taken in the back half of this year and early in the quarter, will stay, but we'll see the volumes start to come back as we move through the back half of the year more meaningfully."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein.', 'Callum Elliott', ""Really good to see the big uptick in brand spending this year and the success is having on competitive performance and growth. My question is, can you talk about some of the other investment buckets outside of advertising and brand spend I'm thinking R&D, CapEx, some of the more infrastructure capability investments that sit in the P&L. Where are you guys today now versus where you think you need to be? And what's the relative importance of these nonbrand spend buckets in your view?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Yes, Callum, a good question because we've talked a lot about positioning ourselves to win in the short term, but more importantly, succeed consistently in the long term. And that has been a lot around obviously the advertising investment. But as you well point out, investing in other areas, specifically capabilities, our digital transformation, would be at the forefront of that, training and developing talent, bringing in talent, ensuring that we're optimizing our agency and the talent that they have on that side. So that's an important part of ultimately building the capabilities to continue to drive the effectiveness of our spend and ultimately setting ourselves up for better data architecture and the infrastructure required to do that and do it consistently over the long term. So a lot of investment going in that space as well. On the capital side, we've had, obviously, a lot of spending on the capital side in terms of increased capacity. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to see that start to shift to a lot more optimization and savings projects moving through our manufacturing facilities. As I mentioned earlier, setting up infrastructure for our data architecture and our data transformation so overall, these are all investments for the long term that we think will continue to play out and allow us to drive that consistent earnings growth that we talked about earlier. Stan, anything to add to that?"", 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""Callum, the only thing I'd say is when you look at the face of the income statement or balance sheet, the absolute numbers, it doesn't reflect the one of our key jobs here is to allocate resources and we reallocate to those high-growth areas or the areas with the most potential. While that may not show on the absolute line underneath the covers, that reallocation of resources, whether it's dollars or human capacity is what supports us in analytics and digital and data and that's for Hannah and to enhance all those capabilities. So lots of work under the covers to drive resource to those key areas."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""And I'd mentioned very indirectly tied to your question, is the strong cash flow, right? The cash flow is giving us the ability to have a lot more flexibility in how we invest across the business, and that is pleasingly up significantly, as you saw in the quarter and the year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""I wanted to ask about gross margin. It was obviously very strong in the quarter and you expect progress in '24. Maybe just some perspective on the work you've done to get here, the drivers this quarter. But then also, as we look at '24, I'm assuming from a year-over-year perspective, that expansion is heavily weighted to the first part of the year. But sequentially, how should we think about gross margin? Is the fourth quarter a high watermark? Or is there a sequential progress that can be made?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Yes. Let me top line, and I'll let Stan answer a couple of questions. Obviously, I think that pricing, I think cost, I think foreign exchange is obviously the big drivers in the cost line for us. So we've done a terrific job in delivering strong funding to growth. I think a lot of opportunities as we head to supply chain settling down our ability to start ramping up a lot of the projects that were in many respects on back burner during COVID. That has allowed us to drive strong funding to growth. We anticipate that, that will continue as we move forward into 2024. The pricing has been a big part of the gross margin expansion that we've been very aggressive with over the last 6 quarters. Yes, pricing will be more balanced as we move forward. So you would anticipate that will be a lesser impact as we move through the gross profit and raw materials will continue to, I think, be inflationary, but far more benign than we've seen in the past, and there's clearly a moderation there. So ultimately, hopefully, an opportunity for us. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more construct to that."", 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""So first, we're very pleased with the progress on gross profit through 2023. We had sequential improvement across the categories driven by a broad base of innovation, productivity that helped offset that commodity situation that we all had to deal with. Now as you think about going forward, coming off of Q4, there are a number of items that always impact the timing, Q4 to Q1. And this year, there's a couple of new ones with a little bit of Argentina, timing of some events worldwide, like Chinese New Year, the timing of when that occurs and where some of this price rolls through, roll through from 2023 and incremental new price. So as we go through the year, we expect that, that will expand, but not at the same kind of levels, obviously, as 2023. So working through that, the teams are focused on productivity. The balance of the top line will change from pricing being the predominant driver to pricing and volume and that productivity will help us drive the margin improvement as we go through the year."", 'Noel R. Wallace', 'Yes. I would just simply underscore that there will be a sequential impact at the margin line on Argentina as we will take pricing in the quarter, but that will take a while to flow through to recover the transaction impact of the deval.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""So I wanted to ask specifically about Latin America volume performance up 8% this quarter, 3 straight quarters of growth. And I recognize that the comps are somewhat easy, but the growth is still really impressive. Can you maybe just unpack how much of that is a function of category growth versus share performance? And really, how does that inform your view on volume growth looking out to '24 in Latin America specifically?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""We talked about it, I think, on the second and third call -- on third quarter call that the strength of our Latin America business and ultimately, our ability to lead in pricing and then the consistent history we have of seeing volume return to the categories. And so if I talk at the category level first, what's great is we've seen all 3 of the categories in which we compete, inflect positively from a category standpoint. And you've obviously seen us growing quite considerably on the volume side, the last 3 quarters, which is generating good volume share growth for our business. So we're very pleased with the overall performance there. And based on where we see the categories inflecting right now, we're pretty confident that we're going to continue to see what balanced growth as we move forward. We'll have to take some currency pricing for sure through the year. But as we've indicated before, we would expect the volume to come back in these markets, and that's exactly what we're seeing. If you drill down to some of our biggest markets, particularly Brazil and Latin -- and Mexico, really strong quarter for both those markets with double-digit volume growth for Brazil and for -- and strong double-digit growth for Mexico as well. So again, a clear indication that the strategy of putting in strong innovation across all price points, getting the advertising, which we accelerated in the fourth quarter, likewise in Latin America is helping to recover the categories and drive good volume market share in that business."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Sunil Harshad Modi', 'Just wanted to follow up maybe on the raw material packaging inflation. Just some more perspective you cited specialty products. I just wanted to get some context around that and what exactly some of those elements are.', 'Noel R. Wallace', 'Sure. Let me throw that one to Stan and he can give you a little bit more context there.', 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""Sure. Unlike the prior 2 years, we don't expect a material impact here. So we see modest inflation in 2024 and there are some areas like every year that go up and down. But there are some new ones this year, things like fish oil has increased significantly. But overall, we expect modest inflation. And so while commodities overall are off of their highs, they're still elevated versus pre-COVID levels. And we expect that as we go through this, there might be a little bit of benefit moving in our favor, but not dramatically. And the only thing I'd say after that is raw materials are one component. So we deal with conversion costs, we deal with transport and logistics costs, and we drive productivity across all these areas through our Funding the Growth program, and that's why we're confident on margin expansion for 2024."", 'Sunil Harshad Modi', ""And Stan, if I could just follow up on Filippo's question. I think he was asking on proteins as it relates to Hill. So you cited ag costs, but maybe you just comment on protein? and what your seeing..."", 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""Yes. Pleasingly, at least at the current point in time, we're not seeing an impact to Hill's in total on an increased basis year-on-year. So we look in total around Hills as ag has kind of stabilized here a bit as well as proteins, we don't see a big headwind heading into 2024 based on total for commodities for Hill's. And that's important because as we drive productivity with modest levels of flow-through on price and the innovation that will allow us to continue to expand margin on the Hill's portfolio."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.', 'Christopher Michael Carey', ""So I wanted to ask about productivity and maybe go down to the regional level. I think this was the best productivity in our model anyway. It's going back roughly 20 years. And so is there anything abnormal about this quarter, any pull forward or productivity? Or are we talking about maybe just productivity muscle continues to build here? And that this is something that we can think about being at a slightly higher run rate go forward. And then just connected to that, this was the best North America margin we've seen in some time. Was there any outsized productivity benefit in the quarter? Or are you just starting to see some easing costs and better efficiency relative to the stabilization we're seeing in the business."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes, a little bit of all of that, quite frankly. Obviously, with the incredible inflation that we've seen over the last 1.5 years across the bulk of our commodity basket we've had to obviously accelerate the funding the growth and the higher cost obviously have allowed us to generate higher funding the growth. As I mentioned earlier, a lot more efficiency in the plants and our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities to drive more of the funding the growth projects has likewise allowed us to step up a little bit of that funding to growth in 2023 that we historically had not -- had the time to do. So a bit of it will be symptomatic of the year and the opportunity but I think the discipline that we've ingrained and the culture that we have at Colgate around funding the growth in parallel, likewise with the global productivity initiative that we put in place has allowed us to generate obviously strong contraction in our costs overall. I wouldn't say use it as a benchmark for going forward. There will be a lot of moving parts to that, but we feel like structurally, we're in a better place on funding the growth. Structurally, we've managed to execute the GPI in line and slightly towards the high end of the guidance range that we provided earlier on that initiative. So we feel like we're in a good place. Pricing will moderate, so it's important that we continue to generate the strong funding the growth and through the P&L in order to generate the margin growth that Stan talked about."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.', 'Olivia Tong Cheang', ""Just wanted to ask you a little bit about the top line, obviously, coming off a very impressive 7% top line growth in Q4. The guide for the fiscal year at sort of 3% to 5%. Can you just provide some perspective thinking about first half versus second half, perhaps the cadence of volume growth is the pricing contribution sort of begins to lap? And then similarly on EPS, obviously, a very strong '23 in Q4, talking about the mid- to high single digits. That, of course, that range implies potential for growth deceleration in 2024. So just talk about what has to happen to get to the high end and what you incorporate in terms of the low end and perhaps an incremental conservatism built into the guide?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Thanks, Olivia. So as I said in my upfront comments, we believe we are well positioned to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth moving forward. And that's certainly reflected in our guidance in the range that we provided. We have a good strong momentum coming out of '23 and heading into '24. And I think most importantly, the flexibility in the P&L and the balance sheet has allowed us to set ourselves up for continued success. As we look at the cadence of that, we will see the balance overall change as we lap the higher pricing that we've had through the bulk of 2023, that will rebalance itself down to be sure and we'll see the volume come back in the categories. As I talked about earlier and ultimately, our focus on driving household penetration with the increased advertising and the market share position that we have. So we think we're in a good position. Comps will get tougher as you say, but we feel that we'll see the volume growth come back and we'll offer balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. Now recognize that we still have some inflationary markets, Argentina, we talked about, obviously, Nigeria and Turkey that will drive some pricing. We've got some flow through. Most of the pricing we'll see in 2024 will be pricing flow through. We are going to take a little bit of new pricing in certain select markets. But overall, we're going to see a much better balance, as I mentioned upfront. How that ultimately unfolds we shall see but we're definitely planning for more balanced growth as we move through the back half of this year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies.', 'Kaumil S. Gajrawala', 'Could you maybe just give us a kind of state of play in China, starting maybe with the market and then getting into your business specifically?', 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Sure. Kaumil. China, you've heard it, I think, consistently throughout the earnings season so far that there's a real slowdown in China, and we're not immune to that slowdown. I will say with respect to some of the numbers out that we feel we've performed very, very well across Greater China. Our business roughly down low to mid-single digits and that was very much commensurate with the category declines that we saw in those markets. But clearly, on the skin health side, we've seen a more acute decline in the categories and therefore, a bigger decline in our business as well. Long term, the market fundamentals remain intact. And I think it will take some time as we move through 2024 for those markets to come back. Obviously, a lot of stimulus money, as you've read, going back into the market, but we shall see the impact that has on consumers and consumption. But we think we're well positioned. The business continues to build share on the Colgate side. We talked about the Hawley & Hazel. We think we're now shipping more closely to consumption as we move through the price increase and some of the inventory allocations that we've seen across the trade and we've got a strong innovation pipeline for next year, but we will be thoughtful and prudent on our investment structure in China until we see the categories come back to the levels that invite us to invest more. But we feel long term, a good market and the dynamics are there, but we want to be thoughtful in the short term."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""On North America, it was great to see volumes inflect a positive this quarter, and you called out growth not just in Oral Care, but also in bar soap, liquid hand soap and cleaners. So I know there's a lot of things that kind of contribute to that better performance. You mentioned more balanced promotions. But was wondering if you spend a little bit of time talking about innovation across the business and any plans for '24. And maybe also if you could talk a little bit about any plans you may have around hand dish and plans to kind of stabilize and regain share in that business?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Lauren. I can't really talk specifically to the innovation that we have in 2024. But I can say, obviously, that we've got a strong pipeline and a much more balanced pipeline across all of our businesses. The acceleration in advertising is thoughtful and strategic as well that we will support more of our businesses in North America. I think that's a reflection of the really strong operating profit growth that we've reinjected back into the business. So we feel like we're in a much better place to support some of the categories that had been -- that had been declining in advertising over the years. So we feel we're in a good place to reflect continued growth on the volume side. Obviously, the pricing will moderate quite considerably in the U.S. as we move through 2024. And we've got a strong innovation pipeline across the categories in order to ensure that we continue to drive market share. The other aspect of it is, as I've talked about, a more balanced cadence of promotions, and we will make sure we execute those very, very thoughtfully. We have no intentions on going back to the historical numbers there, but we feel we've got some opportunities in select accounts in select parts of the country in order to accelerate where we've seen competition be quite aggressive. So good position. Really happy with the health of the P&L. Really happy with the advertising that we put back in the P&L, which will bode well for the long-term health of that business."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.', 'Mark Stiefel Astrachan', ""2 questions for me. One, on North America. So global market share better in North America markets for toothpaste, a little bit weaker advertising spend obviously increased 4Q and for the year. How much is the right level? And is there a correlation in the U.S. between advertising and volume performance? Is there more to it than that R&D, whatever it's curious there. And then on the Hill's business, given the weakness in Pet specialty channel, has it made you think at all about whether your distribution mix in terms of where the product is sold, is it right at this point? Or do you potentially think about expanding that to other retailer areas."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Mark. So North America first. Clearly, we're trying to get much more balanced investment across North America. We needed to get the P&L particularly the middle P&L in the right shape, and that was a strategic choice that we made. A strategic choice enabled by, I think, the broadness of health of our business around the world that has allowed us to obviously accelerate the investment in North America as we took more pricing in the market. So we have a strong innovation pipeline. We anticipate that we'll continue to increase our investment levels. This is not for the short term, this is for the long-term health of that business, which we believe to be a very, very vital market for our success in the future. And we've seen the benefits coming through across our overall consumption. I see Some -- a little softness in the Nielsen track channels, I'll say that our nontrack channels are growing at 3 to 4 of multiple of the tracked channels. So we feel the overall investment in its entirety is proving to grow the consumption and the sales that we need in that marketplace. So long story short, we think we're in a good position for that. On your Hill's comment, our focus is in the channels where we compete. And we believe we're a differentiated unique product that drives the premium nutrition side. Science clearly is the segment that continues to grow, particularly amongst Pet specialty. We have no plans to expand distribution in the food drug mass. We believe that would deteriorate the brand and we have very unique distribution policies that require us to be in the channels that we're in. And we continue, as I've mentioned earlier, to feel we have significant upside in those channels and the brand penetration that I mentioned earlier continues to grow. So in a good place, no intentions on expanding distribution. That being said, as you know, the bulk of our business is done in the U.S. We will be very selective about market expansion on the Hill's business, making sure we get the business model right, making sure the vet becomes a core part of that expansion strategy because that would drive long-term sustainable profitability for the business. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities as we increase the health of that business and the expansion needed in markets around the world."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.', 'Robert Edward Ottenstein', ""Noel, I was wondering if you can talk about India for a little bit. A lot of the companies that we talk to are very excited about the market and see it increasingly vibrant so perhaps maybe review your position there, market share trends, if you're seeing more opportunities and what your plans are? And then just a kind of a housecleaning item for Stan. It looked like there was a $0.07 impact on the other income item on other income, but there were some offsets there and some asset sales and a value-added tax refund. If you could kind of just let us better understand exactly what's going on there."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Yes. Rob. So India, you saw the results this week, very strong results across the board, 9% organic, continued strong pricing and sequentially better volume in that market. I would likewise say we remain very excited and bullish on the market in India. We'll see the continued return to the rural segment, the vitality of the rural segment, which will bode well for volume as we move. As we look forward. The other aspect, which I won't get into a lot of specific details, we have some really strong innovation plan for India, particularly around our core businesses. and we're excited to see that obviously be delivered in the market and executed. The team is doing an exceptional job finding added distribution points to make sure that we continue to capitalize on investment strategy. So bullish on India, good results and sequentially right where we'd like to see their business today and setting us up for ultimately another strong year in 2024."", 'Stanley J. Sutula', ""Rob, let me pick up on your second questionnaire and other income, other expense. As we talked earlier, that is made up of a number of items, both from this year and last year. And Argentina devaluation is certainly an impact, but not the majority of it. We also have some start-up costs in there, some onetime items from this year and last year. What I would say is that's not a new run rate. That's not going to continue into next at that level. And you should think about these as kind of onetime events in nature. So these change as you go through the year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic.', 'Edward James Lewis', ""Yes. Just wanted to talk on Europe. Another quarter of strong pricing this quarter. And looking back, I think it's 9.5% to 2023 or 4.5% in 2022. So just be really interested to hear how you're thinking about pricing over here because consistently, I guess, in the past, pricing hasn't been a big part of the story in Europe. Is this kind of a new kind of attitude we should expect to continue doing sort of more pricing in general coming out of Europe?"", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Yes. Thanks, Ed. Good question. We think we've learned a tremendous amount on pricing in Europe and really work closely with our retail partners to find ways to drive value and ultimately their categories. Clearly, a significant inflation over the last 6 or 7 quarters, which certainly helped to take more pricing in the marketplace. But I think our teams have exited 23 with more confidence. Now there's no question, as inflation declines in 2024, we'll get a much more balanced view of pricing and volume moving back into the P&L but I think some good stories that have allowed us to really accelerate our innovation and drive real value in the categories by relaunching our brands. You heard Jean-Luc talked about that at Deutsche Bank Conference, and I think that continues to be a consistent theme. So a lot of learning there, not saying it's going to be a challenge as we move forward to get more pricing in Europe, but we believe we've got the tools and the vehicle is to continue to find ways to accelerate category growth and therefore, our margin growth in the business"", 'Operator', ""This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I would now like to return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks."", 'Noel R. Wallace', ""Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning.

Now, Mr. Ives still bullish, outperform, target's 315. But he was, in his words, massively disappointed with that conference call. Here's what he told his clients this morning. Here is what Musk needs to do. Want to hear what Dan Ives says--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yes, I-- yes.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Here it is. One, he says, let's get some capital return going. You've got to announce a $10 billion buyback. He says it gives Musk more control. Remember, there's this drama playing out. Musk says, listen, I want control, or I might just take my AI and robotics projects, Julie. I might take them someplace else. I will pick up these marbles. And I will go to a different game. And stop the price cuts, he says. Maintain margin leverage over other auto players. So that was the Dan Ives playbook for Mr. Musk."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, if Musk listened to Ives or anyone except the voices in his head, that would be a first. So we'll see if he does make any of these changes here. Just a couple of superlatives for you as we look at the Tesla performance on the week here, Tesla on-track for its worst week since the one that ended October 20, which incidentally, it also reported earnings. So in words, it fell after that last earnings report, fell after this earnings report. It's now down 26.5% year to date or so, at the lowest price since May. And it looks like we are now looking at the sixth straight weekly decline for those Tesla shares."", ""There's a lot of discussion here about how long these doldrums for Tesla might last or whether the stock is nearing a bottom now and then could reset. I think time will tell. We do know that, after the close yesterday, we learned that Cathie Wood's Ark had come in and bought some Tesla here, in fact, almost 178,000 shares of Tesla.

He was like, no, it's going to be a trickle, at least the first half, in part because, he said, just too much uncertainty still and questions about the economy. And in part, it was, he said, because the reception that these folks are getting has not been encouraging."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Right. And this is not a buzzy tech startup, right?

You can skip our detailed analysis of retirement of the US citizens, and go directly to the Top 5 Hawaii Retirement Alternatives in the World.', 'Covid-19 Pandemic has left devastating impact on life all around the world. The retirement scenario in the US is no different. The “Great Retirement” has led to as much as about 2 million more retirees than what had been predicted by the Federal Reserve economic model. To top it off, the baby-boomer generation has reached its retirement age and thus, is leaving the current work force. However, the rate of new young entrants in the labor force is slower than the rate for retirement, whose wages play a significant role in maintaining social benefits of the retirees. Given all these factors, the strain on Social Security and Medicare programs is mounting. A recent Gallup survey also points to a gloomy future retirement view, held by about 43% of non-retirees. A report by Social Security Trustees provides validation for this pessimistic outlook. According to the report, there is a possibility of the trust funds depleting, by the year 2033, leading to cuts for all concerned parties. In the wake of such conditions, the US citizens are bound to make calculated decisions regarding their choice of retirement places around the world.', 'US retirees generally plan on moving away from their current abode once they say farewell to work. A 2022, US Census report indicated 622,200 people -- aged 65 and older -- changed their states. In their quest for a comfortable lifestyle after years of hard work, they factor in multiple variables before making one of the most important decisions of their lives. Some of these include inexpensive and good quality health care, low cost of living overall, tax incentives, comfortable weather, and last but not the least, pleasant and beautiful surroundings.', 'Hawaii is one of the most famous places that people choose to settle in after retirement. However, the island is a double-edged sword. While the tropical setting is definitely paradise on earth with a luxurious lifestyle, the cost of living is also out of reach for most people. With the expected cost of $121,228 annually, it is one of the most expensive retirement options in the country. The variation for easy retirement between other different states is also estimated at $66,000. Hence, the search for Hawaii retirement alternatives in the world.', 'Some of the best places to retire in the world includes Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia and Romania.

In general, the picture of lying relaxed on a luxurious beach site, sipping exquisite refreshments, is associated with the idea of loads of money.\xa0 Well, as it turns out, this can actually become a reality, in various parts of the world, without the need for a substantially full pocket. The Caribbean islands, for instance, are some of the cheapest places that can prove as financial safe-havens for the US retirees. The best places to retire in the Caribbean includes some of the most stunning islands like Grenada, Dominic Republic, and The Bahamas, among many more. Therefore, it is not very difficult to find some of the best Hawaii retirement alternatives in the world.', 'While there are many places that provide Hawaii alternatives to retirees around the world with affordable cost of living, it is nevertheless prudent to ensure financial strength, especially given the altering circumstances worldwide. As it turns out, about 45% of the US workers are of the opinion that they will not be able to save around $1million, which about 32% of US workers believe they would need to retire comfortably, and about 56% believe that they are lagging behind their target for retirement savings.', 'The US retirement system was awarded C+ by the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index, 2021.

Each place got 2 points every time it appeared on our list of sources.', 'The scores were totaled, and places were ranked from the lowest to the highest scores. For places with the same scores, tie-breaking was done based on the population density (people per mi2). The idea is that with low population density the retirees would be able to experience the beautiful islands to their full potential without the disadvantage of a overcrowded feeling. Furthermore, a lower density would allow the conservation of the natural resources and landscapes for a longer period of time, thus, maintaining their original charm.

The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$122b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Comcast surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$3.71 per share, modestly greater than expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Comcast after the latest results."", ' See our latest analysis for Comcast ', ""Following last week's earnings report, Comcast's 29 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$123.9b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$3.87, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$123.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.93 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$50.29. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean.

This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Comcast's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 1.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 4.5% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.1% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Comcast is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Comcast's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

As an oil and gas exploration and production company, its fortunes are ultimately tied to energy prices. Unlike integrated majors like Chevron, Devon doesn't have downstream operations that provide some insulation from a falling oil price. Unfortunately, the price of oil has fallen from over $93 a barrel in late September to around $73.40 at the time of this writing."", 'However, I think there are a couple of crucial considerations investors should make that support buying the stock.', ""First, while oil is its most important revenue and earnings generator, as previously discussed, the dramatic slump in the price of gas was a big reason for Devon Energy's dividend reduction over the last year. The price of natural gas remains volatile, but the big slump from the previous surge in 2022 (caused by the conflict in Ukraine) is probably over."", 'Second, while Devon doesn\'t have any downstream operations, it has a hedging strategy in place that protects the ""fixed"" (currently $0.20 a quarter) part of its ""fixed plus variable"" dividend strategy. For reference, the fixed dividend equates to a 1.95% dividend yield at the current stock price of $41.', ""For an indication of what kind of dividend Devon could pay, consider that on the third-quarter earnings presentation management outlined that a theoretical price of oil of $60 a barrel and a stock price around $47, Devon's dividend framework would result in a yield of 3.5%. Interpolating using today's stock price of $41 indicates a 4% yield at a price of $60 a barrel."", 'With the current price of oil at $73.40 per barrel, Devon Energy has plenty of potential to deliver significant dividends to investors in 2024. Meanwhile, an ongoing share repurchase program gives management the firepower to buy stock and, in doing so, support the share price.', ""In a previous article, I suggested investors should prepare for some volatility in early 2024. The reason is that growth is slowing, and several companies are starting to report sales shortfalls relative to guidance. It's perfectly normal cyclical behavior and is to be expected after a sustained period of relatively higher interest rates. But more importantly, it's how long they stay high, and the Federal Reserve has hiked rates since the start of 2022."", 'These conditions create risk for many companies, especially ones like semiconductor testing solutions company Aehr. Not only is it exposed to the cyclical risk inherent in semiconductors, but it also has significant stock-specific risk due to its heavy reliance on just a few customers, most notably ON Semiconductor.', ""Unfortunately, that reliance is hurting Aehr now because ON Semiconductor is cutting back on its expansion plans on the back of a single original equipment manufacturer, reducing demand in light of slowing electric vehicle (EV) sales. That wasn't great news for ON Semiconductor, and it's not great news for Aehr Test Systems."", 'As such, Aehr CEO Gayn Erickson lowered the company\'s full-year guidance on the company\'s recent fiscal second-quarter earnings call for the period ended Nov. 30, 2023, saying, ""We are reducing our revenue expectations of at least $100 million this fiscal year by 15% to 25% to a range of $75 million to $85 million.""', ""This sort of variance around performance is only to be expected at this stage of the economic cycle. But here's the thing: There's nothing wrong with the slowdown in the growth rate of EV sales that won't be fixed by lower interest rates later in the year. Moreover, now that expectations have been reset, Aehr trades on less than 22 times the estimated 2024 earnings. That's not a bad valuation for trough earnings in a cyclical company."", 'ON Semiconductor gives earnings on Feb. 5 and investors interested in buying into Aehr should monitor them closely, as both stocks are attractive for investors who like buying into recovery plays.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

Here are two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks down 47% or more to buy hand over fist right now."", ""Shares of Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) are 47% below their peak set in mid-2022. There are several factors behind this steep sell-off. Oil prices fell and high inflation drove the oil and gas producer's costs higher. As a result, Devon wasn't able to generate as much free cash flow. This caused the company to cut its dividend, pushing some investors away in the process."", ""Despite all of these challenges, Devon Energy still offers one of the most attractive dividends in the S&P 500. Its dividend consists of two parts -- a fixed component and a variable component based on excess free cash flow. Devon's dividend yield currently stands at roughly 7%."", ""The stock's valuation also is more attractive than it's been in quite a while due to the sell-off. Devon's shares trade at under 6.6 times forward earnings estimates. By comparison, the average forward price-to-earnings multiple for the S&P 500 energy sector is 11.2."", ""Importantly, Devon's outlook is improving considerably.

It looks for free-cash-flow growth of around 20%, which will push its variable dividend higher. The company also thinks that it will be able to increase its fixed dividend payout.', ""Those aren't just pie-in-the-sky projections. Devon's well productivity has improved significantly. Service costs should experience deflation rather than inflation, and experts are predicting that oil prices will rise moderately in 2024."", ""Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) is another stock that has taken a shellacking over the last couple of years. Shares of the big drugmaker are now nearly 54% below the high from late 2021. Declining demand for the company's COVID-19 products and worries about upcoming patent expirations for other top-selling drugs have weighed heavily on investors' minds."", ""However, I think there's a much better story for Pfizer than meets the eye. Let's start with the company's dividend yield of roughly 6%. CFO Dave Denton emphasized in the Q3 earnings call in October that one of Pfizer's core capital allocation pillars is to continue growing its dividend."", ""2024 could be a trough year for Pfizer's COVID-19 sales. The company appears to have moved past the overstocking issues experienced last year and it has completed the transition from a government-purchase model for COVID-19 vaccines to a private market. Pfizer hopes to have a combination COVID-flu vaccine on the market in 2025."", ""To be sure, several of Pfizer's key drugs will lose patent exclusivity over the next few years. They include blood thinner Eliquis, breast cancer drug Ibrance, and prostate cancer drug Xtandi. However, the company appears to have a good strategy in place to handle these challenges."", 'Pfizer thinks that its new product launches and expansions of labels for existing products to include new indications will add roughly $20 billion in new annual revenue by 2030. It expects another $25 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 from business development deals. The recent acquisition of Seagen by itself could deliver $10 billion in new revenue. These revenue sources should not only fully offset the lost sales from patent expirations but also drive solid growth through the rest of the decade.', ""The pharma stock is a bargain with shares trading at only 12.6 times forward earnings estimates.

You can skip our detailed analysis of retirement of the US citizens, and go directly to the Top 5 Hawaii Retirement Alternatives in the World.', 'Covid-19 Pandemic has left devastating impact on life all around the world. The retirement scenario in the US is no different. The “Great Retirement” has led to as much as about 2 million more retirees than what had been predicted by the Federal Reserve economic model. To top it off, the baby-boomer generation has reached its retirement age and thus, is leaving the current work force. However, the rate of new young entrants in the labor force is slower than the rate for retirement, whose wages play a significant role in maintaining social benefits of the retirees. Given all these factors, the strain on Social Security and Medicare programs is mounting. A recent Gallup survey also points to a gloomy future retirement view, held by about 43% of non-retirees. A report by Social Security Trustees provides validation for this pessimistic outlook. According to the report, there is a possibility of the trust funds depleting, by the year 2033, leading to cuts for all concerned parties. In the wake of such conditions, the US citizens are bound to make calculated decisions regarding their choice of retirement places around the world.', 'US retirees generally plan on moving away from their current abode once they say farewell to work. A 2022, US Census report indicated 622,200 people -- aged 65 and older -- changed their states. In their quest for a comfortable lifestyle after years of hard work, they factor in multiple variables before making one of the most important decisions of their lives. Some of these include inexpensive and good quality health care, low cost of living overall, tax incentives, comfortable weather, and last but not the least, pleasant and beautiful surroundings.', 'Hawaii is one of the most famous places that people choose to settle in after retirement. However, the island is a double-edged sword. While the tropical setting is definitely paradise on earth with a luxurious lifestyle, the cost of living is also out of reach for most people. With the expected cost of $121,228 annually, it is one of the most expensive retirement options in the country. The variation for easy retirement between other different states is also estimated at $66,000. Hence, the search for Hawaii retirement alternatives in the world.', 'Some of the best places to retire in the world includes Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia and Romania. They are not only easy on the purse but also provide safety and security. In general, the picture of lying relaxed on a luxurious beach site, sipping exquisite refreshments, is associated with the idea of loads of money.\xa0 Well, as it turns out, this can actually become a reality, in various parts of the world, without the need for a substantially full pocket. The Caribbean islands, for instance, are some of the cheapest places that can prove as financial safe-havens for the US retirees. The best places to retire in the Caribbean includes some of the most stunning islands like Grenada, Dominic Republic, and The Bahamas, among many more. Therefore, it is not very difficult to find some of the best Hawaii retirement alternatives in the world.', 'While there are many places that provide Hawaii alternatives to retirees around the world with affordable cost of living, it is nevertheless prudent to ensure financial strength, especially given the altering circumstances worldwide. As it turns out, about 45% of the US workers are of the opinion that they will not be able to save around $1million, which about 32% of US workers believe they would need to retire comfortably, and about 56% believe that they are lagging behind their target for retirement savings.', 'The US retirement system was awarded C+ by the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index, 2021. The Natixis Investment Managers 2021 Global Retirement Index also placed them on the 17th place. In contrast, many other developed nations like Iceland, Denmark, New Zealand, and Switzerland, among others, were able to secure a higher score. In spite of a large number of $39 trillion reserved for old age by the end of 2021, these world rankings are certainly food for thought. Many people without a workplace retirement plan has been declared as one of the reasons. However, there are many firms in the US who are conscious of the rights of employees and provide world-class retirement plans.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -7.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, indicating a change of -16.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.8% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.67 points to a change of -31.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -16.1%.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.35 indicates a change of -5.7% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -16.1%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Devon Energy."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.87 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.06 billion and $14.95 billion estimates indicate -21.5% and -0.8% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Devon Energy reported revenues of $3.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%.

The EPS surprise was +5.77%.', 'Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

They point to indicators like the yield curve remaining inverted and projections that the nation's GDP growth will slow in the foreseeable future."", ""The bulls are officially in charge now, but it wouldn't be wrong for the average investor to keep some bear market trading plans handy, just in case. Timing the market is tough to do consistently well. Many of those who try it end up doing themselves more harm than good. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be ready to act."", ""Let's look at where an investor might want to put a decent-sized chunk of their portfolio if a bear market makes a comeback. This isn't a call to go overboard specifically betting on bearishness. It's just reasonable advice for those who like to be prepared."", 'The premise is simple enough: There are some goods and services that fall out of demand when the economy weakens and money gets tight. Conversely, there are some products that benefit from economic malaise as consumers try to get the most bang for their limited bucks.', 'Fast food chain McDonald\'s (NYSE: MCD) offers up some evidence to support this idea. While the economy is reasonably strong right now, inflationary pressures have prompted plenty of people to dine more frequently at its eateries.

Stocks and bonds both have their unique attributes, and move differently than other kinds of assets. Indeed, they don't even move in tandem with one another."", ""Gold and its peers (like silver) are also untethered to other asset classes, allowing them to rise when others are losing ground. That doesn't inherently mean gold prices will rise when stocks are falling. But, it does mean they've got a good shot at doing so -- if only because other investors are more interested in non-stock opportunities."", 'There are several solid ways to step into such a holding, but the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEMKT: GLD) is the easiest and most accessible.', ""They're not considered consumer staples, but there are certain goods and services that remain in demand, regardless of the economic backdrop."", ""Consumers might cancel a vacation or postpone the purchase of a new car when they're worried about their foreseeable financial situation. They're unlikely to turn their power off, though. That's why electric utility companies such as Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) and Southern Co. (NYSE: SO) hold up so well when the economy is weak."", ""Bolstering their resiliency is the fact that while they're not technically monopolies, effectively, they very often work like monopolies. Moreover, while their rates are regulated, most rate-hike requests are granted to the utility companies asking for them."", ""Prescription pharmaceuticals also generally continue being purchased during bear markets linked to economic malaise. Again, like food and electricity, medicine is often something that people simply won't -- and even can't -- live without. It certainly helps that health insurance companies are often footing the bill for the bulk of consumers' drug purchases."", 'Just be sure to hunt for proven, high-diversified pharmaceutical companies like Merck (NYSE: MRK). Younger biopharma players may run into liquidity headwinds when capital markets are struggling.', ""Prior to the middle of 2022, interest rates had been so low for so long that some investors forgot yields on cash and cash equivalents hasn't always been comically low."", ""With rates back closer to long-term averages now, however, cash isn't exactly the inflation-lagging dead money it's been for the past several years. It wouldn't be crazy to park a piece of your portfolio in such an investment while waiting for a bear market to run its course. A small gain is still better than a big loss, after all."", 'This tip does come with something of a footnote: The yields on the simplest cash options are still markedly low; most are in the 0.5% range right now. True money market funds are paying in the ballpark of 5%.', ""How do you know which one you're holding? You'll likely have to check with your financial institution and look closely at your statements to be sure. However, unless you've specifically instructed your bank or broker to move cash into a money market fund, you're likely sitting on the lower-yielding option."", ""The only potential catch is liquidity. Whereas your bank or brokerage firm will freely issue checks or make immediate payments from your lower-yielding cash holdings, in most cases you'll need to explicitly instruct your service provider to sell any amount of money market funds you want to spend. Like the purchase of such a fund, such as sale takes a couple of days to complete."", 'Given their decidedly better yields, though, utilizing this option is well worth the trouble.', ""Last but not least, although the point of this exercise has been identifying where to invest in a bear market, don't look past the fact that bear markets are ultimately great opportunities to add more long-term exposure to the market as a whole. You can never really go wrong stepping into a broad-based fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY)."", ""Not to discourage you from thinking -- and acting -- defensively when stocks start running into headwinds, but you should know that most market-timing efforts don't work. Indeed, as was already noted, they often do more harm than good. Data from Standard & Poor's indicates that over the course of the past year, more than 60% of large-cap mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500. Stretch that time frame out to 10 years, and the number of market laggards grows to nearly 86%. And these are professionals!"", ""In other words, timing the market is tough. You're probably not going to be able to identify the beginning or the end of the bear market with enough accuracy to make it worth your while to try.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation."", 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28).

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in MCD?', ""In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $11.80."", ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's.

A few of them have already boosted their payouts in 2024. Many more will likely do so in the coming months. Here are seven stocks primed to hike their payouts by around 10% in 2024.', 'Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has done a phenomenal job growing its dividend since initiating the payment in its 2011 fiscal year:', 'AVGO Dividend data by YCharts', 'The semiconductor and software company most recently hiked its payout by 14% last December, marking its 13th straight year of dividend increases.', ""Broadcom is in a strong position to continue growing its payout briskly in 2024. The company recently completed its transformational acquisition of VMware. That deal will help boost its revenue by 40% this year. Meanwhile, it's capitalizing on the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend, which should drive accelerated revenue and earnings growth. That will give it even more cash to pay to shareholders in the coming years. "", ""Domino's Pizza\xa0(NYSE: DPZ) dividends have been growing briskly. The pizza purveyor gave its investors a 10% raise last year and has more than doubled its payout over the past five years. "", 'The leading pizza seller is in a strong position to continue growing its payout at an appetizing rate. Its ""hungry for more"" strategy aims to drive more sales and profit growth over the next five years. It aspires to grow its annual operating income by more than 8% annually during that period. That should enable it to generate significantly more free cash flow to return to shareholders through repurchases and a fast-growing dividend. ', 'Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX) has steadily increased its dividend since converting to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in 2015. The data center REIT hiked its payment twice last year. It increased its dividend by 10% in February and another 25% in October. ', 'The company expects to continue hiking its dividend in the future. It sees growing demand for data centers driving 7% to 10% annual growth in its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share through at least 2027. Given its low dividend payout ratio (45% last year), the company expects to grow its dividend per share at a more than 10% annual rate over the coming years. ', 'FactSet Research Systems (NYSE: FDS) has grown its dividend at a 9.2% compound annual rate over the last six years, including giving investors a 10% raise last May. The financial data and analytics company is in an excellent position to continue growing its payout at a healthy clip. ', 'The company expects to deliver 6% to 9% adjusted earnings-per-share growth this fiscal year. Meanwhile, it has a low dividend payout ratio (30% of its net income last year) within its medium-term target range (25% to 30%). That should put FactSet in the position to increase its payout at a high-single-digit rate this year, with the potential to give investors another 10% raise. ', 'Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) has grown its dividend at a double-digit annual pace since 2013, including increasing it by 11% last February. The exchange operator aims to raise its dividend as its earnings grow. ', ""The company took a big step to boost its earnings growth last year, closing its nearly $12 billion acquisition of Black Knight to bulk up its mortgage technology business. Intercontinental Exchange expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its earnings with further increases as it captures cost savings. That builds on the company's already strong base. It delivered 11% adjusted earnings-per-share growth in the third quarter and 15% adjusted free-cash-flow growth through the first nine months of the year. "", 'Paycom Software (NYSE: PAYC) just started paying dividends last year, declaring its first payment in May. However, the payroll software company is in an excellent position to grow its payout briskly in 2024 and beyond. ', ""The company set its initial payment low (about 20% of its operating cash flow and around 25% of its earnings). That's much lower than the 55% or more payout ratios of its larger rivals in the payroll sector. Meanwhile, Paycom is growing a lot faster than those peers (10% to 12% expected revenue growth in 2024, compared to 6% to 7% for its two biggest peers). Add a cash-rich balance sheet, and Paycom is in a prime position to hike its payout by more than 10% in 2024. "", 'Prologis (NYSE: PLD) has historically delivered above-average dividend growth. The industrial REIT has grown its payout at a more than 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, including by 10% last February. ', 'The global warehouse operator seems likely to give its investors another double-digit raise this year. It grew its core FFO by nearly 11% per share last year. Meanwhile, it expects its FFO to rise by around 9% per share at the midpoint of its guidance range in 2024 (with further upside potential from acquisitions). With a low dividend payout ratio for a REIT (less than 70% last year) and a fortress-like balance sheet, Prologis could easily afford to hike its dividend by another 10% this year. ', ""Many companies will likely give their investors a raise this year. Broadcom, Domino's, FactSet, Equinix, Intercontinental Exchange, Paycom, and Prologis are among those primed to hike their payouts by around a double-digit rate in 2024. That makes them excellent options for those seeking a rapidly rising income stream."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Broadcom wasn't one of them.

If you want to, you can directly jump to our list of 5 countries where Americans can live long-term without a visa.\xa0', 'For about 158 million adults around the world, moving to the United States is a dream. However, according to a study by the University of Kent, one-third (33.1%) of all US-born US nationals living in the States are now considering leaving the country to live abroad. Another survey shows that roughly three-quarters of Americans (76%) have visited at least one other country, including 26% who have been to five or more. According to researcher Dr Klekowski von Koppenfels, many factors are compelling Americans to travel and live abroad, but the primary reason is to experience and explore different countries and cultures.\xa0', 'Overall, there are many reasons why American citizens have been looking into options for relocation. Some want to live abroad to get a sense of adventure and live their life freely and safely (see: 20 Safest Countries for US Travelers in the World), while others want to do so to escape the burdensome tax system and economic turmoil or for better work opportunities. As of today, the federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25 per hour, and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 1 million workers have wages at or below the federal minimum wage in 2022. Low income and high cost of living are one of the driving factors for US citizens to move out of the US.\xa0', ""Moreover, many Americans are moving to EU countries for an affordable healthcare system and improved education as well. Healthcare in America is largely provided by the private sector, meaning it doesn't come cheap, even when companies like CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS), one of the largest healthcare companies in the United States continue to introduce relatively more affordable pricing plans. According to The Commonwealth Fund findings of 2021, there was an estimated debt of $88 billion on consumer credit records in America. In 2005, 3.6 million Americans migrated to Europe, and that number increased by 1.4\xa0 million in 2019.\xa0\xa0"", 'Relocating out of the US is also a trend among some US businesses that want to reduce their tax burden. The process is called Corporate Inversion, where companies move their headquarters to a country with a low rate of corporate tax and gain greater profits. Over the years, many large companies have moved their headquarters outside of the US for the same reason, and to cut down operational costs. Some notable names include Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT) and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX). Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT) moved to Ireland, hoping to benefit from the 12.5% corporate tax rate. However, after Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT)’s move from America, it experienced a huge blow to its credit rating. Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX) also moved to Ireland. Besides financial concerns, the company also hoped to benefit from the legal and regulatory environment of the country. In 2023, Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX)’s annual revenue was $7.384 billion.', 'Note that other companies, big and small, alongside US nationals, choose to move abroad for the same reasons as well. As of 2024, the American passport ranks number six in the world according to the Passport Index. American nationals can travel visa-free to 172 countries. However, despite the strength of the passport, relocating and settling in a foreign country is not easy. A lot of planning and work goes into it, such as finding job opportunities, accommodation, accustoming to the new culture and even learning the local language. Instead of packing life in the US and relocating to a foreign country, it’s better to first live in that country as a traveler for some time and see if it fits the needs. For business owners, the same applies. The problem that arises here is that acquiring a visa is a lengthy and time-consuming process. Although Americans can travel visa-free to almost any country they want, a visa is still required to live long-term.\xa0', 'Fortunately, visa laws vary from country to country. For example, in the US visa laws, citizens or nationals of the countries that are participating in The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) can stay in the US for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa. The rest of the travelers have to go through the strict visa processes. In general, for US nationals, most countries allow them to stay for up to 30 to 90 days, but not many countries have a policy for long-term stay without a visa.\xa0', 'Here, we have compiled a list of 22 countries where Americans can live long-term without a visa.', '22 Countries Where Americans Live Long Term Without a Visa', 'For our list of 22 countries where Americans can live long-term without a visa, we analyzed the mobility of the US passport as listed by the Passport Index.

Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it\'s one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the ""short-termism"" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.', '""You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.""', 'But how does Gabelli find ""specific stocks"" to invest in?

This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.""', ""In another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations.

In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong customer engagement and demand for our premium products.

Coming out of the COVID pandemic in January of 2022, we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth and we set an aspiration to sustain growth over the longer term at levels that were higher than what we were achieving prior to the pandemic. At that time, we laid out a growth plan with the objective of positioning the company to be able to deliver on our aspiration of driving annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth over the long term.In executing the plan, we focused on listening to our customers and understanding their needs, and we invested in innovating our value propositions as well as uplifting our marketing and technology capabilities and backing our colleagues to meet those needs. Looking back over the 2 years since we announced the growth plan, I'm pleased to say that we achieved what we set out to do. And in fact, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be on our journey, thanks to the millions of premium customers we have around the world and the American Express colleagues who support them.Today, we are a larger and stronger company. Since 2021, we've delivered record annual revenues, increasing the scale of our business by over 40% in just 2 years from $42 billion to $61 billion in annual revenues. In revenues, annual card spending over this period has increased 37% on an FX-adjusted basis to a record $1.5 trillion. We've added about 25 million new proprietary card accounts over the last 2 years and over 70% of these new accounts are coming into the franchise on fee-based products. With the growth in new accounts we've seen over the past few years, we now have a total of over 140 million cards running on our global network.Our focus on continuously innovating our value propositions to meet the needs of our customers is driving increased brand relevance across generations, including Millennial and Gen Z consumers. These customers represent over 60% of the new consumer accounts we acquired globally in 2023 and 75% of new consumer platinum and gold accounts acquired in the U.S. came from this cohort. At the same time, retention continues to be very high, and our credit metrics remain strong and best in class. These strong results reflect the success of our strategic investments we've made in our business, along with the tremendous earnings power of our business model.Looking ahead, let me tell you why I feel really good about our future prospects. We have a business model that is delivering premium performance, and we have strong momentum, which is driven by 4 key features of our model that differentiate us from the competition and are difficult to replicate. First, our economic construct has a set of diversified revenue sources that include card fees, spending and best-in-class lending. With our subscription-like card fees being a core and fast-growing component of our revenue mix. We have a singular focus on premium customers and superior innovative value propositions. Our premium customers are high-spending, loyal and drive our strong credit performance.We have a large and growing partnership ecosystem that expands our brand value to Card Members and merchant partners around the world. And we have a global brand that is servicing ethos that truly sets us apart. Our business model provides us with strong competitive advantages. And the way we've been able to leverage the model's unique elements and execute our strategy has strengthened those advantages giving us the runway for continuing our momentum across generations, geographies and both our consumer and small business customers.The power of our business model combined with the global scale of our premium customer base, the dedication and focus of our talented colleagues, and the attractiveness of the many growth opportunities we see ahead are the key reasons why I'm confident in our ability to continue on our growth plan. And it's why going forward, we'll remain focused on our long-term aspiration of delivering annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth.We believe this aspiration is the right one, and we aim to achieve it every year. However, we managed the company for the long term, and we anticipate there will be a range of potential outcomes in any given year due to a variety of factors such as external environment and actions we might take that we decide are best for the business. Looking at this year, the continued momentum we've seen in the business as we've executed our strategy gives us confidence in our guidance for 2024, which is in line with our long-term aspiration. For the year, we expect to deliver annual revenue growth between 9% and 11% and full year EPS of $12.65 to $13.15. In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.70 a share up from $0.60 beginning with the first quarter 2024 dividend declaration. This represents more than a 60% increase in the dividend from when we introduced our growth plan in January of 2022.As always, we will continue to run our business for the long term, and we'll do that by listening to our customers and meeting their needs through innovative unique value propositions and exceptional service that reflects our brand built on trust and security, delivered and supported by a world-class colleague base. In keeping our focus on backing our customers and our colleagues, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis over the long term.Thank you, and let me now turn it over to Christophe."", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our 2023 results, which reflect another strong year of performance and to lay out our expectations for 2024. I will discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning. Since its year-end and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we run the company.Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Full year revenues reached an all-time high of $60.5 billion, up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported full year net income of $8.4 billion and earnings per share of $11.21. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.62.Let's now go through a more detailed look at the drivers of these results, beginning with Billed business on Slide 3. We reached record levels of spending for both the full year and the fourth quarter in 2023. Total Billed business grew 9% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter, Billed business grew 6% as we continued to see more stable growth rates after lapping the prior year impact of Omicron back in the first quarter. This 6% growth rate does reflect a bit of softening versus last quarter. But I would point out that the number of transactions from our Card Members continues to grow double digits year-over-year, a good indicator of the engagement of our customer base.Our growth was driven by 5% growth in Goods & Services spending and although slower than last quarter, continued strong growth in Travel & Entertainment spending, up 9% for the quarter. Restaurant spending remains our largest T&E category and reached $100 billion for the full year for the first time, while airline spending growth slowed in the quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses.Starting with our largest segment on Slide 4. U.S. Consumer grew billings at 7% this quarter. We continue to see growth across all generations and age cohorts with Millennials and Gen Z customers again driving our highest billed business growth within this segment. Their spending was up 15% this quarter.Looking at Commercial Services on Slide 5. Overall growth came in at 1% this quarter, consistent with last quarter's growth rate. Spending growth from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers remain modest given the unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Specifically, in 2022, we saw a large increase in organic spending as businesses restock their inventories following supply chain issues during the pandemic. This caused a significant grow-over challenge with spending from this segment in the industry in 2023. Importantly, we continue to see strong levels of demand for new accounts, high levels of retention and strong credit performance on our small business products. Looking ahead, this positions us well for the future, as spending growth rebalance.And lastly, on Slide 6, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services. We continue to see double-digit growth across all regions and customer types. Spending from International Consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers, each grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Overall, while we're seeing a softer spend environment, we are pleased with the continued strong engagement and loyalty of our Card Members across the globe. As we think about 2024, we are assuming a spend environment similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters.Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth of 13%. We expect this growth, which has been elevated versus pre-pandemic levels to continue to moderate as we progress through the 2024, but to still grow modestly faster than billings.Turning next to credit and provision on Slide 8 through 10. First and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices and our disciplined growth strategy. As we had expected, our write-off and delinquency rates did continue to tick up this quarter, as you see on Slide 8. Going forward, we expect to see this delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with modest increases in 2024.Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide 9. The modest increase in our Card Member loans and receivables delinquency rate, combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances, resulted in a $400 million reserve build. This reserve build combined with net write-offs, drove $1.4 billion of provision expense in the fourth quarter.As you see on Slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with $5.4 billion of reserves, representing 2.8% of our total loans and Card Member receivables and continuing to reflect the premium nature of our Card Member base. This reserve rate remains about 10 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or day 1 CECL. We continue to expect the reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024 similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters.Moving next to revenue on Slide 11. Total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 15% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q4 and 9% for the full year, as you can see on Slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year, as you can see on Slide 13. As we expected, growth continued to moderate a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our cycle of product refreshes.In 2024, we expect to exceed the year with some further momentum compared to the current growth, supported by continued product innovation and our focus on premium value propositions. We currently have plans to refresh around 40 products globally next year. In the quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new Card Members continue to look strong.Moving on to Slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in Q4 and 33% for the full year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year. When you think about 2024, you should expect to see net interest income growth moderate as balance growth moderates, with some continued tailwind from our tenured customers continuing to rebuild balances. And I would remind you that for our business model, we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from a lower interest rate environment next year.To sum up revenues on Slide 15. The power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum, looking forward into 2024, we expect to see revenue growth between 9% and 11%.Moving to expenses on Slide 16. Overall, total expenses were up 5% in the fourth quarter and 10% on a full year basis, both growing significantly lower than revenue. This expense growth reflects the strong growth we are seeing in our business, the investments we've made as well as our continued focus on expense discipline. Starting at the top of the page with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 40% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full year. I would note that these costs came in a bit lower than our expectations reflecting some of the natural hedges in our model.As T&E spend growth slowed a bit in the quarter, we saw lower reward costs than we had expected. For example, a lower mix of redemptions for airlines tickets and fewer points earned on airline spend. In 2024, I would expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our Card Members.On the marketing line, we invested around $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full year. This is a bit below last year and our expectations to have marketing spend at around $5.5 billion. Marketing expense came in lower than we expected for the quarter, reflecting lower demand given the softer T&E environment. However, we saw demand increase as we move through the quarter, and we continue to plan for increased marketing spend in 2024. We're confident that with our sophisticated acquisition engine will do so in an efficient way.Moving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $14.9 billion for the full year 2023. This was above our original expectations, driven by a few notable items in the quarter. First, as part of the normal course of business, we set up a reserve to cover expenses as we continuously look to enhance the organization's effectiveness. We also set up a reserve for exposure to a specific merchant and like many others, we were impacted by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which increased our OpEx in Q4 by $115 million.Looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage and are focused on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done. In 2024, we expect operating expenses to be fairly flat to this year's expense. We will, of course, continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year, and our flexible model will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed. Taking everything into account in 2024, we expect total expense to grow mid- to high level digits for the full year as we expect to drive continued leverage through our operating expenses.Turning next to capital on Slide 17. We returned $5.3 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023, including $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter on the back of strong earnings generation. We ended the year with our CET1 ratio of 10.5% within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 2024, as Steve discussed, we expect to increase our dividend by over 15% to $0.70 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings and our 20% to 25% target payout ratio. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach.That brings me to our long-term aspiration and 2024 guidance on Slide 18. We continue to run our business with a focus on our aspiration of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth, and we believe that is the right aspiration. As Steve discussed for the full year 2024 specifically, we are introducing our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11% and earnings per share between $12.65 and $13.15. This guidance remains in line with our aspiration and also factors in a range of scenarios based on what we're seeing in our business today.We also recently announced an agreement to sell our certified business. Our guidance and the items related to 2024 that I just walked through do not include the potential impact from the sale. We do expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business as we've done with similar transactions in the past. We expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide more detail then.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open the call for your questions."", 'Kartik Ramachandran', 'Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.', 'Donald James Fandetti', ""Good to see the 24% EPS guidance and rev guidance. I guess on January spend, some of your peers have noted a slowdown on weather. Can you comment on that? And then just maybe talk a little bit about Billed business in '24 in terms of SME."", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. So we don't talk about monthly numbers. So let alone about a few weeks into the month of January. So I think pass this to wait until the end of the quarter, and we'll provide a lot more color and detail on the billing in January so far. As far as how we think about Billed business in 2024, our planning assumption is that we should expect or we're expecting billings to be consistent with what we've seen in the prior few quarters. And we are ready to see an upside if there is some. But for now, that's the assumption we baked in our plans and how we constructed this guidance.On the SME side, it's the same assumption, if you want. We are assuming something similar to what we're seeing in Q3, Q4, and we are very focused on winning the recoveries with SMEs. As I said in my remarks, these Card Members have been through a lot over the last 2, 3 years. And we are focusing on providing the best experience, the best products. We're focusing on acquiring as many customers as we can in helping them grow their business. And we'll be ready when they're ready. Historically, this has been a volatile segment for us, you know how dynamic these customer segments are, and we play a critical role in that industry, and we'll be ready when they're ready."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.', 'Ryan Matthew Nash', ""Maybe to build on Don's question, can you maybe just dig a little bit deeper on some of the drivers of revenue growth at discount revenues, card fees? And Christophe, I know you said that NII should decelerate. And are we assuming any sort of reacceleration as we move through the year, particularly in areas like U.S. Consumer or SME?"", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. Ryan. Thank you for your question. So the building blocks of the revenue growth remain the same at a very high level we expect billing and, therefore, discount revenue to grow at a pace similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. We expect card fees. So Q4 is at 17%, full year at 20%. We expect card fees to be a key contributor to growth going forward, to remain a key contributor to growth going forward. And actually to exit Q4 at a higher level than where we are right now. And I give you the context in my remarks, very much supported by the constant strength in premium acquisition through product refresh and renewals that we are committed to execute on and very strong retention rates, which we have experienced for many years now.And when it comes to the last component of our revenue pool, net interest income, you should expect that growth rate to moderate very much driven by the fact that -- and you've seen the trend, I'm sure, Ryan, the asset growth and the lending growth rate has been moderating over the past quarters. And we expect that moderation to continue. The very strong growth was a function of tenured Card Members rebuilding balances post-COVID. And at some stage, we're going to reach the more normal rate there, and that will naturally drive NII due to a more moderate level of growth.I got to also mention that we believe that the interest rate dynamic and what the Fed will decide doesn't play a big role here in terms of what's going to happen to NII. And when you put all of this together and you can -- we run multiple scenarios, what if billing is a bit stronger, what if NII is a bit weaker. And we land in the same range of 9% to 11%. So that's very much how we think about the revenue guidance."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank.', 'Mark Christian DeVries', ""Yes. I was hoping you could dig a little further into kind of where the loan growth is coming from? How much of it is from new customers or relatively recently added customers versus older and gaining share there? And also whether you're seeing any kind of difference in credit performance on kind of balances from newer customers versus older?"", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Okay. So let me take loan growth first. The dynamic on loan growth has not changed. And for several quarters now, it's also our philosophy and how we run the company. About 70% of their loan growth comes from tenured Card Members and what we call tenured Card Members is Card Members who've been with us more than 12 months. And that's very much how we think about acquisition. We acquired Card Members, we develop relationships with them. Then we offer them we cross-sell products, we increase the lines, we nurture those relationships. And we do that because we understand them better. We understand their spend patterns and they understand our products better as well. And that's the driver.We don't do much balance transfers, if any at all. And we don't have promotional offers, much promotional offers also. So it's very much growing with our tenured Card Members. And it's part of our strategy to contain, if you want the credit risk and to control it. And when it comes to the credit profile of the new Card Members, we haven't changed our credit underwriting models, right? We still -- and we haven't changed as well our marketing channels and products. Well, we still skew towards positive selection in terms of credit profile. That has not changed. And I need to say that the prospects that we bring in and become recent Card Members have very good credit profile."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.', 'Bill Carcache', 'I wanted to follow up on your comments about customer engagement spending outpacing revenue growth. Can you speak broadly to your ability to continue to drive customer engagement with elevated investment spending, while at the same time, offsetting that margin pressure with operating expense leverage in other parts of the business. And I guess, do you anticipate positive operating leverage on an aggregate basis with revenue growth outpacing the sum of that customer engagement and operating expense combined?', 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. There's a lot here. So let me first take you through customer engagement. The key thing for us, and you heard us say this for years, right? We build premium products and we price for that value. You heard say as well that over the last years, we -- the mix of the portfolio shifted more towards premium products. That premiumization of the portfolio is the key driver behind that ratio of variable customer engagement expenses to revenue. The more Platinum Card Members we bring more variable customer engagement expenses, you should expect to see.But at the same time, we have a lot of initiatives to actually optimize this. We have a lot of innovation in that space. I'm going to share with you one that is driving a lot of efficiencies for us. We recently introduced the Pay with Points option where you can actually go in the app or the website, select one specific transaction and Pay with Points. So we have that either constant innovation to try to delight the customers, make their life easier and at the same time, create efficiencies in terms of the weighted average cost per point.And specifically, in Q4, one of the driver of that efficiency or that variable Card Member engagement expense was the fact that we saw less point redemption with airline tickets, which is one of the most expensive cost per point that we have. That drove some efficiencies in that metric. We also saw as there was some softness in some T&E categories, less point accelerators earned, and that created as well some efficiencies there. The reason why I'm pointing that out is just to give you some example of some of the natural hedges that exist in our business model, where when you see a little bit of softness in the top line, that creates some savings as well in some expense lines.So we guided towards a little bit of an increase in terms of the variable Card Member engagement expenses. And we're going to keep monitoring that. But I feel good about that trend. And I think that, that margin is still very strong and able to generate very strong earnings. We've committed to containing OpEx. And as I said, we expect 2024 operating expenses to be about flat to where we are ending 2023.And marketing expenses will dial up or down based on opportunities that we see space on the efficiencies that we create as well. The model works really well, as you can see, and I'm comfortable that the model is strong, and we are stress-testing that model running multiple scenarios, and it works well in terms of its ability to generate earnings over time. And I would say risk-adjusted earnings because that powerful model, why do we pay on variable Card Member engagement expenses, comes back with a multiple on the credit line. We attract positive select, we generate positive select, we attract premium Card Members who have a very strong credit profile. And I like paying for that as opposed to trying to control the credit risk down the road."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley.', 'Jeffrey David Adelson', ""Chris and Steve, just wanted to dig into the softer T&E trends a little bit. It looks like you're seeing some softness, particularly in airline spend. You're seeing some slower point redemptions for tickets there. Just maybe give us some insight into what you're hearing and seeing from your Card Members on that front? And then just maybe in the forward book, can you help us understand what you're kind of embedding in your expectations for T&E from here. And I think in the past, you've talked about how the booking trends have been a pretty good indicator of what's to come. Maybe any comment on what you're seeing there?"", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. So T&E sequentially, the growth rate came down. I need to point out, though, that is still up 9% year-over-year. So it's a pretty strong growth rate. In terms of airline spending, if you heard, I'm sure the various airline, they all made comments about a bit of the softer demand. And since many of those customers are using an American Express card to pay for their airline ticket, we saw a similar trend. This being said, booking remains very strong on our TLS segment. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know they were strong.So I don't -- we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing a lot of strength in the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations of new cards are very strong. And Card Members decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past. And we've seen in that choppiness as well in the past. I don't worry it's one data point. And for 2024, we haven't communicated on exactly what assumptions we're making by category. But I'm not too worried. We have a Card Member base that loves traveling, and I'm sure they're going to keep traveling."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan.', 'Richard Barry Shane', ""Look, you guys had alluded to the fact that the reserve rate is going to go up or drift up in 2024. I'm curious if what's driving that? Presumably, it's a mix shift between loans and Card Member receivables. But I'm wondering if at any level you're also suggesting that the reserve rate on the loan portfolio is going to go up as a reflection of either -- some sort of shift there? Is it just pure mix shift as the loan portfolio grows faster than the Card Member receivables."", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. So thank you, Rick, for your question. So this is very -- this is an important point, so I'm glad you're asking the question. The first thing I want to say is that the absolute level, when you look at the delinquency rates or the write-off rates are very low in terms of our historical performance. And on the slide, I put as well the pre-pandemic levels. The write-off rate is 2% in Q4. It was 2.2% pre-pandemic, right? So we're still below where we were pre-pandemic. So in absolutely very low. Relative to our peers, which I know you know well, they're also very good. And I'm sure you noted that every competitor appear reported their numbers and experienced the same tick, but at a higher magnitude. Our tick up of 0.2 or 20 basis points is one of the lowest in the industry. So I feel good about where we are, and I feel good about the trend.When it comes to the dynamic in the portfolio, the key driver behind this is that there's still some normalization going on here. We are moving from sub-1% write-off rate during the pandemic. As you all know on this call, this was not a sustainable level, and these rates are normalizing. And they are normalizing at a slow pace, and I like that. And the 2% is, again, a place where I feel comfortable from a credit standpoint.The other thing to expand a little bit and take a step back in terms of what kind of loan growth we are seeing. The biggest contributors in terms of loan balances are the pay overtime facility that we offered with our charge products and the co-brand cards. And so both those portfolio has very strong credit profile and better credit profile than what we call internally proprietary lending, which includes Blue Cash Everyday, for instance. So if anything, the profile of the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio is shifting and evolving more towards products that have a strong credit profile and high velocity. This being said, that normalization is happening, and that's what's creating that little tick up. And as I said in my comments, we're not quite done with that normalization. There's still a bit more to come in our minds, but not a lot."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC.', 'Saul Martinez', ""Maybe I could just ask on capital. Is there any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about Basel endgame? You obviously your preliminary expectations of the proposal at least are that it would take you down to closer to 7%. But there is a lot of talk about that, that being softened. Just how are you thinking about capital management. You obviously increased your dividend. But how are you thinking about buybacks going forward in light of the uncertainty?"", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. So thank you for your question. So not a lot has changed on that front outside of the fact that we've been meeting with regulators, Steve met with regulators, I met with regulators as well. And what I can tell you is that they are listening, they're engaged. And I think they understand our comments the ball is back in their camp now and they're incorporating all the comments they received from the industry, and I'm sure you've seen a lot of those comments as well. So they have a lot of work to do. Right now, we are in waiting mode.And I think we're expecting, the current estimate is we're expecting there or at least their next version of the rules by the end of 2024. We'll see it took 10 years to get to their first drop. So we'll see when we get the next version. I'm not too concerned. I feel good about our starting point and our capital position. As you know, we generate about 30% return on equity, which means that we generate a ton of capital. And for now, we're not going to change our capital policy. The first thing we do is, of course, fund the balance sheet, then we distribute dividends. We feel very confident about the increase that we are planning to do this year. And the rest is going to go in share buybacks so that we keep capital between 10% and 11% of our risk-weighted assets. And that's what we've done for years. That's what we're going to keep doing. And we don't adapt to the Basel rule. We're running the company conservatively as well with a big buffer over the 7% rate that we have. And so nothing has changed much on that front. So more to come when we get the final rules."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen.', 'Moshe Ari Orenbuch', ""Great. And many of the questions have been asked and answered. But hoping to follow up on a comment that you had just made about the pay overtime business. Could you talk a little bit more about the characteristics of that? You mentioned that obviously, that's going to tenured charge card customers. So the quality is very strong. Can you talk a little bit about the yield and how much you've seen in kind of growth from that product?"", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. The -- so your description is correct, Moshe. It's a facility that we attached to our charge card products, where they can decide if they want to revolve a portion of their bill. And the -- this is the fastest-growing category for us in terms of loan growth. It was very well received. It was very well received by the Card Members. And I don't know what else I can tell you. Remember that their charge card has a no preset limit, which is an important feature here. So it's a way for us to give them as well, and it's a painful product. So it's a way for us to give them a facility where they can revolve over a period of time. And as I said previously, the credit profile is very strong on this product. Very much because it is attached to a very premium base, right? premium Gold Card Members are using this facility and revolving from time to time."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', ""Maybe I could ask the questions regarding what's embedded in the revenue growth expectations for 2024 differently. If we look at the fourth quarter exit run rate, would that sort of target us to the low end of the guidance range? And then Christophe, you mentioned that lower rates shouldn't help, but aren't you guys liability sensitive on the charge card portfolio?"", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""So let me take the second question first. We are slightly liability sensitive. And the key assumption for us, but the comment remains that in its totality, our total balance sheet and total funding stack level, the impact of rate cost is going to be very small to our NII. The bigger known here is what's going to happen to the beta. We've been, as an industry, trending around 0.7 on the way up. We probably got a trend 2.7% on the way down, but not immediately. And it's hard to say exactly at this point in time where we're going to be when the Fed starts cutting rates. We are making assumptions that we think are conservative, but we don't know for sure, and we'll see where we are. So there is a bit of uncertainty here. But what is -- what you know for sure is that you should not expect a big impact to our NII depending on the rate curve.Going back to the -- to your first question around revenue, I just -- I don't have a lot to say on top of what I said earlier and what I said in my prepared remarks. I'm happy to be surprised on the upside if Billed business is stronger. Card fees, we have good visibility. NII, I think the trend is very established. And on billing, as I said, we are assuming at this point in time something consistent with what we've seen in the previous quarters. And we'll see where we are at the end of the year. But if the economy rebounds, if the growth is a bit stronger than what is expected by economist and our Card Members are optimistic and keep spending. I'd be delighted to have a high Billed business to report."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer & Co.', 'Dominick Joseph Gabriele', ""Steve and Chris. I was just curious about the total card growth. I mean, we all know that you've seen some really excellent account acquisitions over the last number of years. But I was just curious about total card growth versus proprietary cards-in-force growth, in particular this quarter, if there's any color you can provide on why that may diverge or what the strategy is between maybe having more proprietary cards as a percentage of total cards. Anything on that would be excellent."", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. So we have about 140 million cards that can transact on our network. Out of the 140 million cards, about 80 million are issued by American Express. That's what we call the proprietary cards. They represent the bulk of the spend, and they drive the very vast majority of our economics. From a growth rate standpoint, if you look at cards-in-force and it's -- you'll see that in the details of our disclosures. The proprietary cards-in-force up 5% year-over-year and the total cards-in-force. So including their cards issued by network partners is up 6%. Does it answer your question?"", 'Dominick Joseph Gabriele', 'Very much. I really appreciate that.', 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi.', 'Arren Saul Cyganovich', ""Maybe you could -- I was wondering if you could talk about the plans for the next platinum refresh in the U.S. I think the last one was on 2021 and whether or not you have any plans to do that this year and if that's in your guidance for the year as well."", 'Stephen Joseph Squeri', ""Yes. So as you know, we have committed to refreshing 40 products this year as Christophe had said. And strategically, we look at refreshing all of our products on a sort of 3- to 4-year basis. And it's important, because it's really important to make sure that we keep our products fresh, we're listening to our customers and putting in those enhancements and the extra value that they want and it enables us to make sure from a generational perspective, we are modifying those products as trends change and as our customer needs change. As far as specifically for the Platinum Card, we don't really preannounce that. And so I think you just have to wait and see."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners.', 'Craig Jared Maurer', ""Two quick questions. Considering the strength of Delta Air Lines over the last number of years is consistently the top airline. You've clearly benefited a lot from that in terms of new card issuance and likely spend as they've been able to hold fares better. As we see airlines spend slow, does that benefit diminish? And is it something you have to think about? And second, in terms of small business, we've been pretty flat now for a couple of quarters. Curious what you're seeing under the covers there. Is this -- are you still able to issue new cards? Or -- and are you seeing any reluctance from small business to take additional products that might increase their cost beyond the baseline. I'm just trying to understand the move better small business owners."", 'Stephen Joseph Squeri', ""Yes. So from a small business perspective, the drive is really organic spend. We're not seeing existing small businesses spend more than they spent the year before. And that's not an American Express phenomenon. That is an industry phenomenon. As far as card acquisition within small businesses, that still remains strong. As far as small businesses looking at our platform and looking at our loans and so forth, that remains strong, and the credit quality remains strong. I think as Christophe said in his remarks, there is this phenomenon of inventory buildup, some interest rate shock and so forth. And so small businesses tend to be very, very secular. I would be much more concerned if we weren't acquiring cards, if we weren't engaging in new small businesses or if write-offs and delinquencies were higher. So at the moment, as we look at this, we truly believe this is an organic spending issue, and it's not American Express specific. I'll let Christophe talk a little bit about Delta."", 'Christophe Le Caillec', ""Yes. So the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%. And we are originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their softness in terms of Q4. Hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip, time will tell. But it's still doing very, very strong and the engagement with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong. So I don't see any softness there at all. And I will say as well that the credit quality of those new Card Members remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest growing segment on the loan side, and it comes with very strong performance. People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality. And we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So I'm not worried about that at this stage."", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.', 'Mihir Bhatia', ""I just wanted to go back a little bit and maybe just unpack the billings growth a little bit. Maybe can you just talk about how much of that is being driven by adding new Card Members versus winning wallet share? And then just related to that same topic, is just how are you thinking about the environment for new card acquisitions? Is this $3 million level that you have been at for the last couple of quarters, the right level to think about for the next year? I understand that is dynamic and you'll change, but what have you assumed in your planning?"", 'Stephen Joseph Squeri', ""Let me talk about sort of card acquisition numbers. We go out and we look at acquiring Card Members really focus on acquiring build business and require revenue. And consistently now, if you take the first quarter out of last year, where it was a little bit more of an anomaly of 3.4 million cards, we've been around that 3 million to 2.9 million. And we will -- as long as we have line of sight into high credit quality premium Card Members, we will continue to be out there aggressively acquiring Card Members. And that range will be where we see that range today between 2.9 million, 3.1 million. We don't really provide any guidance on that. But with the amount of money we're planning on spending, I think that's a -- it's a pretty fair assumption. And we report that, but what we're really focused on is making sure that we're getting build business acquired.When you look at the composition, obviously, in a stronger environment, you're really looking for more organic growth from your existing cardholders. And I just made the comment before, where small businesses, that's not what we're seeing. And so when you look at any growth that you're seeing from a small business perspective, that is truly from new cardholders acquired. And a lot of the growth from a consumer perspective right now is new cardholders acquired, which actually, as we think about engaging with our cardholders gives me a lot of confidence going forward because as we continue to engage and not only get more wallet share, but as our Card Members get back to where they were probably before the third and fourth quarter, we believe there is upside there from a billings perspective.And we've talked a lot about Millennials over time. And we get on this growth trend, we get on this trajectory with these Millennials and Gen Zers where we start with a higher share of wallet, and we start with that higher share of wallet because they're used to using their American Express Card everywhere. And as they move through their life cycles, their wallets increase. And so we have a lot of confidence in the long-term lifetime value of our -- of the Millennial base and of the Gen Z base that we're now acquiring, and you see even in this fourth quarter, that is 32% now of our total spending.So the way to think about this right now is a lot of the growth is coming, that you're seeing is coming from new card acquisition, but there will be an organic step-up as the economy gets better. So -- and that gives us a lot of confidence of how we're positioned for future growth over the long term, which gives us confidence to say, aspirationally, we should be a 10% plus revenue company. And that's why you see the guidance that we've given this year both from a revenue perspective and EPS perspective."", 'Kartik Ramachandran', ""With that, we will bring the call to an end.

They are in the red as the chipmaker's first-quarter guidance came in below expectations. You could see Intel getting shelled in today's trade, Julie, down about 12%. By the way, that stock is now down about 30% since Pat Gelsinger took charge as CEO. So Q4 results beat, but the focus is on that guide, the Q1 forecast, which was weak relative to consensus."", 'And just some puts and takes here to consider. The division that includes PC chips, that saw sales jump more than 30%. But the data center and AI segment, which is where Intel is really looking to take on Nvidia, the big player there, sales dropped 10%.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and just to put this in perspective again, as you talked about, yes, the stock is down since he took over again, but it is still up over the past year because hopes had been rising that he would be able to turn things around, that there would be a comeback for Intel, that it would be able to capitalize on the AI chip craze. So the shares are still up about 45% over the past year, even with today's decline, which is the largest single-day drop for the stock going back to July of 2020. So now the question is, Is this a fundamental hit to the optimism? or, Are we going to continue to see them recover in the coming months?"", ""The other measure that people were watching closely with Intel is its gross margin, which had regularly been around 60% if you look at a pre-2019 time frame. In the first quarter, it's going to be 44 and 1/2%. And the company is trying to work back to that gross-margin level where it was in the past, and obviously it still has some ways to go there as it does these efforts to start a foundry-- restart a foundry business and, indeed, capitalize on AI."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, we should mention, you know, Intel's Pat Gelsinger was on Yahoo Finance this morning saying the stock reaction today is an overreaction, in his opinion. He was talking about the tailwinds as he sees them-- the AI, PC, the improving product line. Told us the foundry business-- so making chips for others-- revenues will ramp in 2025 and beyond. But clearly investors, at least in today's trade, skeptical."", 'JULIE HYMAN: One of the people we both follow closely, Stacy Rasgon over at Bernstein.

It missed on the top and bottom lines here, but the company did forecast earnings that are ahead of estimates."", ""And Visa on the flip side here despite an earnings beat. We're seeing some weak commentary from Wall Street analysts who are looking at a consumer slowdown, potentially, in January."", ""Let's talk AXP quickly here.

So that might be part of the reason why investors are looking past."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, they said, listen, if it hadn't been for that, they said we would have beat."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Right, so maybe that's a little bit of the reason that investors are looking past those more negative numbers and bidding up the stock. And then Visa kind of the opposite situation there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and it was interesting comments from the American Express CEO talking to our own Brian Sozzi about the economy, saying, listen, I think it's slowing, he said, talking about the economy. And that's what's in our guidance, slightly lower economy, not a recession, he told Sozzi, but a slightly lower economy. And he was saying, listen, with our business model, we think we can perform even in that kind of environment, a slower-growth economy, sounding very confident there to Brian."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's interesting, though, on the Visa side because it does look like that a lot of the analysts were relatively positive in the commentary around the stock. But to your point, there is some concern over January numbers and how spending there is going to look and that there is a softish start to the second quarter, according to one analyst over at KeyBanc."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, I thought it was interesting on Visa. Dan Dolev over at Mizuho-- smart guy. We know him. Always one of those guys I pay attention to-- telling his clients on Visa, first quarter was strong, but he kind of did call out this softer-than-expected trends in January and higher opex guidance. So he's staying on neutral there."", ""And finally, check out shares of Spirit Airlines in the red as JetBlue could be walking away from their deal. In an SEC filing, JetBlue states that certain conditions of the deal require for closing may not be met in time. So you've got to-- this one you've got to follow the bouncing ball of this story. So Spirit really tanking here in today's trading. The news with JetBlue saying, OK, we might end this bid to buy the carrier. Of course, this comes after that judge blocked the deal, right?"", ""And JetBlue is now saying there are conditions to the deal that might not be met by the deadline in this agreement, and that could lead to termination, maybe as soon as this weekend, Julie. We don't know what terms exactly it sounds like they're being referred to here. But now Spirit then hitting back pretty hard and publicly. So a war of words beginning here."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and this is a change because both of them had been trying to fight the regulatory pressures on them to not get the deal done. Now they're turning on each other, and both of them have something to lose here. JetBlue will owe Spirit if the deal is blocked for antitrust reasons, but Spirit might owe JetBlue money also if the deal falls apart for other reasons."", ""So, you know, not-- they obviously have something to lose because they'll have to pay each other, but they'll also have something to lose because they were hoping to get stronger by teaming up here. You know, JetBlue was counting on getting those Spirit planes to try to increase its fleet. So it's definitely a messy situation."", ""JOSH LIPTON: I mean, Spirit at this point, you just kind of wonder what the options are because we've had financial analysts on our show who know the company really well, and they were talking about, you know, possible bankruptcy.

His long track record of outperforming the market backs up the notion. So when he makes a purchase for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio, it's worth paying attention."", ""Unfortunately, investors haven't had much to get excited about in Buffett's portfolio recently. During the first nine months of 2023, he was a net seller of stocks. He sold $32.8 billion in stocks for the company, buying just $9.1 billion in new investments."", ""There were several big investments Buffett trimmed in his company's portfolio last year, but there's one big holding he keeps buying. Here's what investors need to know."", 'During 2023, Buffett cut significant positions in Activision Blizzard, HP (NYSE: HPQ), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX).', ""The sale of Activision was predictable. He made a big purchase of the stock in early 2022 following the company's announced acquisition by Microsoft."", 'It was a classic arbitrage play. Buffett bought the shares below the acquisition price with the expectation that the deal would close and he would profit from holding the shares.', ""He didn't end up holding on to the shares until the deal closed, selling a large portion in the second quarter and the rest in the third quarter. The deal closed in October of 2023 after he had completely exited his position in the stock. Nonetheless, it worked out well for him."", ""Buffett's change of heart on HP was a bit surprising. He established a large position, exceeding 10% of the shares outstanding, in the first quarter of 2022. He added to it as recently as the first quarter of 2023. But he started selling shares in September, and the selling continued through November. He's now cut the position by more than half from its peak."", ""Buffett is never afraid to admit when he's made a mistake, and that appears to be the case with HP. As 2023 went on, it appeared the lasting hangover from the COVID-19 work-from-home boom was cutting into HP's results."", ""The recovery isn't coming as quickly as expected, and the long-term outlook for HP's two main businesses -- PCs and printer sales -- isn't great. As such, Buffett is cutting his losses and moving on."", 'His other big sale in 2023 has been a relative success for the Oracle of Omaha. He purchased a huge position in Chevron in the first quarter of 2022 as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine sent oil prices higher.', ""Chevron managed the ongoing tensions, and the stock's total return -- including dividends -- outpaced that of the S&P 500 through the third quarter last year."", ""But Buffett is content with decreasing his exposure to Chevron because he's more interested in owning shares of a different oil and gas company. It's the one stock he couldn't stop buying throughout 2023, and it's a good bet he'll keep buying more in 2024."", ""Throughout 2023, Buffett consistently added more shares to one of Berkshire's top holdings, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)."", ""Berkshire Hathaway established its position in the company when it put up $10 billion in capital to facilitate Occidental's acquisition of Anadarko. In exchange, Berkshire received 100,000 preferred shares of the oil and gas company, paying an 8% annual dividend."", ""But Buffett established a much larger position in the company at the same time he bought Chevron in 2022. He bought about 15% of the company's shares outstanding at that point, and he has steadily added to that position since."", ""After its most recent purchase in December, Berkshire Hathaway now controls nearly 28% of Occidental's common stock. In the meantime, though, Occidental is retiring Berkshire's preferred shares, offsetting Buffett's moves to increase exposure to the company."", ""Occidental is an interesting investment for Buffett. Its balance sheet isn't nearly as strong as competing oil companies, including Chevron. After the acquisition of Anadarko, it faced a challenging environment brought on by COVID-19. It had to suspend its dividend as a result, because cash flow dried up with low oil prices."", 'But management has been able to keep its debt under control while not being afraid to use debt to expand the business.', 'For example, its recent acquisition of oil and gas producer CrownRock will result in a lot of debt going onto the balance sheet. Management plans to sell off assets to pay down the debt quickly, just as it did with Anadarko. That makes Occidental a riskier investment, but Buffett has expressed a lot of confidence in CEO Vicki Hollub.', ""He is particularly drawn to Occidental's position in the Permian Basin. As the crux of Occidental's operations, it makes the stock much more susceptible to swings in West Texas crude oil prices, as a drop in price will make it unprofitable for Occidental to keep drilling. On the other hand, if oil moves higher, the company should be one of the biggest winners in the industry."", 'With shares trading at an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple of 5.5, they offer a slight discount to Chevron (6.3) with strong upside if oil prices move higher again.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

The stock trades at a relatively modest 16 times its estimated future profits. Investors are getting a great bang for their buck at that price.', ""AstraZeneca reported revenue of $33.8 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Its growth rate may look puny at just 2%.

Those qualities should allow the company to continue rewarding its shareholders for a long time."", ""In the mid-term, the biotech will count on its two key growth drivers, eczema treatment Dupixent and Eylea, which treats an eye disease. Though Eylea's patent protection runs out somewhere between 2025 and 2028, Regeneron earned approval for a high-dose formulation of the medicine last year that should be safe from this threat, at least for a while. Beyond that, the company still has a potentially rich and exciting pipeline that should yield key approvals and eventually replace its current crown jewels."", ""Regeneron's late-stage pipeline features 11 programs, including some brand-new ones. Elsewhere, the biotech is dipping its toes in the highly promising gene-editing field through a collaboration with an expert in this area, Intellia Therapeutics. Regeneron is going after many challenging targets with almost four dozen clinical programs in its pipeline. New approvals for key products are likely before Eylea and Dupixent lose their impact on Regeneron's revenue growth."", 'Even more regulatory approvals could be on the way.

Vertex expects to announce late-stage results for VX-548 in treating acute pain in early 2024. Previous clinical data for the drug looked highly promising.

This means the annual payment is 2.3% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.', ' See our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ', 'While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Based on the last dividend, Norfolk Southern is earning enough to cover the payment, but then it makes up 147% of cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 97.5%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 37%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.00 total annually to $5.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Norfolk Southern's EPS has declined at around 3.3% a year. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", ""Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While Norfolk Southern is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer.Last year was historically challenging with a major derailment to start off the year, followed by network disruptions, and compounded by a stubbornly weak freight market. The Eastern Ohio incident tested our resolve. I'm proud that our team responded decisively and responsibly to protect this great franchise and our shareholders, and to address the community's concerns.With an unwavering commitment, we have strengthened our safety and service. We have kept and will continue to keep our promises to make things right in Ohio, to improve our service to our customers, and to make a safe railroad even safer. A crisis allows you to accelerate change and we acted. This includes a number of positive changes to how we design the network and assemble trains with measurable results. As we show on Slide 4, our improvement in safety is already being highlighted by a dramatic 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate in 2023.2023 was also historically important for Norfolk Southern because we began to implement and advance our new strategy to position our business for sustainable growth and success. The intermodal service composite chart on the right side of Slide 4 tells an important story that speaks to the clear gains we have made in both resiliency and service following significant strides in service in 2022. With our investments in resiliency through leadership plan and resources, we demonstrated the ability to execute our strategy to run a safer railroad that delivers a compelling service product to our customers and handles increased business, a balanced approach to safely delivering service, productivity and growth.We overcame multiple significant network disruptions in 2023 and exited the year with the best intermodal service we have delivered in over 3 years, all while intermodal volume grew 5%. Entering 2024 with a safer and more fluid network that is attracting growth, we have the platform to narrow our focus to specific areas to drive increased productivity. And we are building positive momentum by executing on our strategic vision. Part of that strategic vision is our commitment to industry competitive margins, and we are determined to deliver on that promise just as we have delivered on promises on service and safety as volumes grew.We will leverage our PSR operating plan with our current resource base to meaningfully improve velocity and resilience within our merchandise network, which accounts for 2/3 of our train starts. As we achieve a high degree of compliance to the plan and merchandise, we will reduce variability, complexity and cost. We are driving that forward now with the results already seen in December and January. It will drive asset velocity that will lead to productivity gains and cost savings. And in 2024, we are targeting a double-digit percentage improvement in terminal dwell, which is a good barometer of the health of our, and fluidity, of our merchandise network.Paul will go into more detail about how we are planning to build on our success in intermodal, deploying changes to accelerate our merchandise network, which I've noted will be a major source of productivity for Norfolk Southern in 2024 and beyond. To further describe what we are doing to improve profitability and drive smart growth in 2024, Ed will talk about how his team is winning business and pushing hard to negotiate price in excess of inflation.Importantly, we are streamlining our cost structure and eliminating inefficiencies. We invested in 2023 to enhance safety and service. We will see the benefits of this in our cost structure in 2024. We will take actions this year to reduce costs in other areas. This includes a program to reduce management headcount by roughly 7% to help offset increases in critical operating areas.Our groundbreaking transformation will take time. We recognize the necessary investments in resiliency and service had temporarily increased our cost structure, particularly visible during the trough in this freight cycle.On Slide 5, you'll see we laid out the scenario where during a down cycle we may modestly underperform in order to be coiled to secure volume and incremental margin when the freight cycle recovers.While we didn't expect 2023 to be a continuation of a soft rate market, coupled with numerous disruptions, we are optimistic that recovery is on the horizon and our investments will yield returns. We will deliver near-term margin improvement as we implement our strategic vision: a balance between safe service, productivity and smart growth. We are on the path to achieve that balance.In the aftermath of the derailment and network disruptions, we have improved safety and service in a responsible manner and are in securing new business with a stabilized network and a high degree of compliance to the plan. We will continue to iterate the plan, reducing complexity and enhancing executability and balance. All of this will unlock productivity and fluidity, which, in line with our strategy, will allow us to attract more volume at accretive incremental margins and deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry competitive margins.With strong franchise advantages that will serve us well as we move through this economic cycle, we are poised for a bright future as we balance safe service, productivity and growth.I'll turn it over to Mark and the rest of the team, who will add some context around the timing and magnitude of our planned improvements in performance and profitability."", 'Mark R. George', ""Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7 with an update on our costs related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. During the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the bulk of the soil remediation being completed. It's an encouraging achievement. However, as you'll note, we incurred $137 million charge in the quarter, which related to an extension of the time line for ongoing testing as well as additional work that will be completed in nearby streams. There was another $89 million incurred in legal costs and other fees. But of note, we received $76 million of insurance recoveries, bringing the total recoveries in 2023 to just over $100 million. From a cash perspective, the net outflow in 2023 was $652 million after the insurance recoveries.While we're pleased with our remediation accomplishments, we currently expect ongoing monitoring efforts and cleanup efforts will continue through 2024. There will be additional costs in the future related to legal settlements and fees, although the amounts and timing cannot currently be estimated.Moving to Slide 8, where we illustrate the impact of these fourth quarter results on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row. While on row 2 we isolate the accounting to our Q4 financials related to the incident. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted results to prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion.Revenues were down nearly 5%, while adjusted operating expense was 3% higher. The adjusted operating ratio for Q4 2023 was 68.8%, which represented a year-over-year deterioration but notably was up 30 basis point sequential improvement from our third quarter performance. The sequential improvement is encouraging but we fell short of our expectations as service-related costs did not come down as we anticipated.While our recovery efforts related to the IT outages in late Q3 restored service quickly for our customers and allowed us to handle more business, it cost more money in the form of crew-related expenses that persisted well into the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 19% year-over-year. Net income and EPS were down 19% and 17%, respectively.Turning now to Slide 9. Adjusted operating expense for the quarter was up $59 million. The increase, excluding fuel decline, was up $123 million. The largest drivers of the increase were employment growth as well as inflation across all categories. In comp and ben, looking to '24, we plan to keep overall head count levels flat versus the year-end '23 exit rate, with some additional mechanical craft hiring to be offset by upcoming reductions in the nonagreement category that Alan discussed.Purchased services was up due to higher costs associated with technology spend as well as increased mechanical services, including repairs around our auto fleet as we prepare for growth opportunities in 2024. The increase in rents was driven by short-term locomotive resources and increased car supply for our auto fleet. We expect quarterly rents in 2024 to remain slightly above these fourth quarter levels due to more adverse TTX equity costs and volume metric related increases, partially offset by benefits coming from improved velocity.The increase in materials relates to locomotive and freight car repairs. Claims were lower year-over-year. Recall that in Q4 2022, we had a large adverse adjustment. The other component is unfavorable, driven mainly by fewer real estate gains.Moving now to Slide 10. Last quarter, we introduced this slide to help investors think about our service costs and resiliency investments, which are 2 components of our current cost structure. On the left side, we see costs that should not be part of our cost structure and have grown out of service that has not met planned levels, mainly related to recrews and overtime. These costs did not step down as expected in Q4 due to the crew-related costs we incurred to accelerate service recovery for our customers after the IT outages. So while service has been at strong levels exiting the year, Q1 costs will remain somewhat elevated in part from the cold weather we are seeing here in January. Overall service costs should meaningfully unwind in Q2.On the right hand, we show costs tied to our investments in resiliency, mainly related to additional T&E crews that we have added in locations where we were understaffed as we position Norfolk Southern to realize outsized growth in revenue and margin in a growing volume environment. Our total T&E headcount is now at an appropriate level that will allow us to absorb volume growth in '24 and beyond. There will be some additional hiring in mechanical crafts that will be offset by reductions in non-agreement positions. The additional craft hires mean that resiliency costs will settle in roughly in the $55 million per quarter range in 2024. Adding those resources will drive benefits over time of being an even safer and higher-velocity operation.Moving to Slide 11 and results below operating income. Other income of $38 million was up $4 million in the quarter, driven by higher interest income on the extra cash we are carrying ahead of the CSR closing. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2%, due to a rate adjustment on our deferred state income taxes and tax-free gains on favorable company-owned life insurance. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the usual 23% to 24% range.Turning to Slide 12 and recapping our full year results. We started the year planning for modest top line growth that would afford a level of expense growth to help drive our strategic track toward resiliency. The disruptive events of the year and an adverse macro environment upended this. Revenue declined 5%, which was meaningfully affected by about 6 points of pressure from lower fuel surcharge revenue and a sharp year-over-year decline in storage fees. At the same time, OpEx rose 5%, fueled by inflation and investments in our business. As a result, operating income fell 18%, with the operating ratio rising to 67.4%. Favorable below the line items and benefits from share repurchases held the EPS decline to 15%. In 2023, free cash flow was $1.4 billion lower than the prior year, representing the impact of the $650 million derailment-related outlays as well as the lower operating income, coupled with higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions in '23 were $1.8 billion, with 2/3 being driven by our rock-solid dividend and the remainder from share repurchase activity.I'll mention that we did issue debt in November and built up our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end as we prepare to fund the strategic CSR purchase that is scheduled to close on March 15. As a result, we will see higher interest expense in 2024, and we will temporarily suspend share repurchases while we absorb the asset and bring our credit metrics back into our target range.It's important to remember that CSR is a highly strategic, critical artery in our network, for which we had a rare window to secure and guarantee control of the asset forever. This also enables us to control longer-term costs that could have begun to escalate sharply with the upcoming lease renewal.I'll now hand over to Paul, who can provide an update on our operations."", 'Paul B. Duncan', ""Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Turning to Slide 15 to begin our operations discussion with safety. We made progress in enhancing safety in 2023. We finished the year with our second-best injury rate in 8 years but we are striving for better. We enhanced our conductor training program and continue to leverage our partnership with Atkins Nuclear, a foremost expert in safety across all industries. We also closed 2023 with a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999. Thank you to all of our craft colleagues and leaders for enhancing safety at Norfolk Southern this last year.While these are very noteworthy accomplishments, we must become even safer. When the major incident in Eastern Ohio happened in early 2023, we were already in the process of reviewing and adjusting our train makeup rules and it was a high priority of mine. We ended up accelerating network by a lot. What we produced was an even better product than we already had, which helped us make such progress in mainline accidents, and we are striving to become even safer.This is the platform for which we can now lever up our train plan to deliver productivity and growth. Though the change in our operating rules was implemented on an accelerated time line and caused network disruption, we know it was the right move for the long term and we kept our promises to restore fluidity and service levels in the second half of 2023. The future of our operation is very bright and I am proud of the work we did in 2023 on this front to keep our promises.Moving to Slide 16 for further discussion on service levels. We took a modest step backwards to begin the quarter related to the system outages that we experienced but quickly regain footing and continued our glide path of improvement in November and December. It is important to note that we deliberately chose to deploy additional resources so that we could balance restoring fluidity while delivering peak volume.We were successful on that front. We delivered a very strong service for our intermodal customers during peak season and pushed overall volumes to their highest levels in over 2.5 years as you will hear more about from Ed. But as you heard from Mark, it did result in higher-than-planned service recovery costs in the quarter. We remain sharply focused on reducing those and have actively been unwinding more T&E crew expense in recent weeks in areas such as temporary deployments, overtime, recrews and other crew-related expenses. This has included reducing our intensity of GO Team members deployed on the network. Now that we have made this next step function improvement in intermodal service, we expect to remain there as we transition to leveraging our resources to drive greater productivity and growth.Turning to Slide 17 for a discussion on productivity. We've improved 4% sequentially within workforce productivity and expect an improving glide path to continue. We are driving this in 4 ways: One, by improving fluidity; two, by maintaining strict discipline and accountabilities to plan compliance in our operations; three, through discrete productivity initiatives that we'll discuss in a moment; and finally, through converting trainees to productive employees.As promised last quarter, we ended the year with 600 conductor trainees. We are now confident with the overall size of our T&E workforce to efficiently serve the growth that is on the horizon. On the locomotive front, referencing our service commentary, miles per day remained lower as we kept additional power and service to jump start the network with peak volume. This is an area that will benefit significantly from further improvements in velocity as faster train speeds allow us to drive our locomotives in the terminals on time and send them back out on their scheduled connections. And lastly, fuel efficiency finished flat despite the additional locomotives online, thanks to our initiatives. And this is an area we are intensely focused on improving in 2024.Moving to Slide 18. The next phase of our operational improvement will be marked by enhancing the velocity and resilience within our merchandise network. Recall that our TOP|SPG operating plan, which we launched in 2022, brought further PSR principles to our intermodal network, driving enhancements to container velocity and resilience with intermodal. That successful evolution enabled intermodal service to remain strong throughout 2023, particularly in Q4 where we delivered the best intermodal service in over 3 years while delivering on peak season.Now we are building on that success with further enhancements in our merchandise network. First, we are improving our execution and discipline to run with a higher level of plan compliance. We're tying together the improvements we've made around our operational strategy leadership accountabilities and resource allocation by sweating our assets further and strict execution to the plan.Next, we are leveraging precision train building processes embedded into our terminals to optimize connections and depart trains on time. We're already seeing the benefits that arise from success in driving scheduled network velocity. Our success will be demonstrated by making sustained improvement in terminal dwell, where, as Alan mentioned in his opening remarks, we expect to drive a low double-digit percentage improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Investors can also track our progress in the AAR train speed, particularly the subset of manifest train speed, which has an outsized impact on our cost structure as well as merchandise trip plan compliance and car velocity, the outcomes of improving speed, dwell and disciplined execution of plan. Of course, there is always week-to-week noise in these measures, so we would look for improvements in trends on a rolling 12-week basis.On Slide 19, I'd like to provide more detail on how sustaining these velocity improvements will drive down our cost structure. First, we will see reductions in various buckets of T&E related expense, and that will also help to lower our headcount intensity. Next, as we spin up the flywheel, we'll get cars moving faster, a critical element to scheduled rarity and overall productivity. Having our yards in mainlines more fluid will indicate that cars are flowing unimpeded through the network. This will drive a capacity and productivity dividend within our fleets, in our yards and on our main lines. That, in turn, will allow us to bring on growth at low incremental cost, lifting the overall workforce and locomotive productivity and achieving service resilience that will allow us to take further share from truck. Driving these benefits into our operation by improving the velocity and resilience of the merchandise network will be a key aspect of delivering progress in 2024.Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed."", 'Claude E. Elkins', ""Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 21, let's cover our commercial results for the fourth quarter. Overall volume improved 3%, led by growth in intermodal and our automotive markets. Now despite volume growth, total revenue and revenue per unit declined for the quarter due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and intermodal storage and fees, along with negative shipment mix within the portfolio continuing from last quarter as well as headwinds from a weak truck price environment due to the persistent overabundance of capacity.Looking at merchandise, volume was flat compared to the prior period and revenue was challenged by lower revenue from fuel surcharge compared to that prior period. RPU less fuel increased 1% as price gains more than offset the impacts from negative mix. This increase set a new quarterly record for Norfolk Southern and marks the 34th of the last 35 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in merchandise RPU less fuel. We're committed to driving value through price and this commitment is demonstrated through quarterly record set in our automotive market for revenue, revenue less fuel, revenue per unit, and revenue per unit less fuel.Let's move to intermodal. Volume in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year, with gains in both our domestic and international lines of business. Revenue for Intermodal was down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significantly lower revenue from storage and fees in the prior period. Also lower fuel prices and an excess supply of available trucks as well as negative mix within our international business impacted revenue per unit negatively. Excluding the impacts of fuel and elevated storage and fees, which are related to supply chain congestion, Intermodal RPU declined 1% in the quarter. We're confident our domestic franchise is a coiled spring, positioned to yield strong incremental value as the truck market recovers.Turning to coal. Overall volume increased slightly, with strong demand for export more than offsetting declines in our utility coal franchise. The market for utility confronted persistently high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Coal revenue was down 4% year-over-year, with lower commodity prices and lower revenue from fuel surcharge negatively impacting RPU.Now let's turn to Slide 22 and review results for the full year. Total volume came in at 6.7 million units, a 1% decrease from 2022. Volume declines were most significant in intermodal and our energy-related chemical commodities. On the positive side, lower ocean freight rates, advanced demand for international intermodal and rising vehicle production activity drove growth in our automotive franchise, both of which contributed meaningfully to offsetting larger declines. Revenue for the year was $12.2 billion, down 5% or $590 million from 2022, driven by lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage fees as well as lower volume.I do think it's important to point out, however, that if we exclude the $650 million revenue hit from fuel and storage fees, which is essentially a post-pandemic normalization of those items, underlying revenue was actually positive, even with volume down 1%, which speaks to our commitment to core pricing smart growth. RPU excluding fuel, intermodal storage and fees increased 2% as we realized above budget price results in merchandise and in coal. In fact, we set annual records for merchandise revenue, revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel.Objectively, the freight environment in 2023 was soft with weak demand for goods, lower levels of manufacturing activity and generally less freight coming in from overseas. These conditions amplified the excess capacity in transportation pressuring margins and growth opportunities. Our focus throughout the year was creating value with a resilient network to drive growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw that growth materialize with improved volume, and that volume will bolster our revenue performance in the coming year as we execute our pricing strategy to grow core revenue per unit.Let's look ahead to 2024 on Slide 23. Our market outlook is for modest volume growth. In merchandise markets, overall volume growth is expected to be driven by gains in steel shipments. Automotive will grow on continued strength in vehicle production, including new EV business. Improved fluidity and increased network velocity will lift our effective capacity in both of these markets.Shifting to intermodal, we are optimistic that increasing levels of international trade will boost demand for both our domestic and international services. There's still uncertainty around how quickly capacity in the truck market rightsizes. Additionally, the strength of the consumer could pressure growth if the economy softens.Lastly, our coal outlook is for relatively flat volume levels compared to last year. Demand for export coal is forecasted to be high but some of this demand will be met via a shift of historically domestic coal to export markets. Utility demand will be driven by stockpile levels, which are forecast to remain elevated in 2024, aside from extreme weather events.Looking at price, we expect strong pricing conditions in our merchandise markets, aided by our improved service product. However, as mentioned, a persistently weak truck market will mute the opportunity for intermodal price with contract truck rates expected to trend roughly sideways from their current levels throughout 2024. We also faced some headwinds on coal pricing this year related to difficult comparisons for seaborne coal prices, with additional pressure from high stockpiles and weak natural gas prices.All said, we still expect to generate pricing above rail inflation in 2024. When we take all this together, we are reasonably confident that overall market fundamentals will create opportunities for us to bring on new freight and further the volume trend we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023, while delivering incremental top line revenue growth through core pricing gains as we price into the value of our enhanced service product.Finally, let's turn to Slide 24. I'd like to give you some examples of how our customer-centric approach is yielding smart and sustainable growth. Last February, our team met with FedEx Ground with the intent to enhance Norfolk Southern service for their transportation network. We listened to their business forecast and made strategic adjustments that we knew would set us up to better serve this valued customer. We charted a better way forward for both of our organizations. As a result, we were able to significantly increase our volume for FedEx Ground during peak season and we look forward to continuing that growth into the future.We also landed a new plastic recycling plant in Ohio with our new customer, PureCycle, which is expected to launch this quarter. This is a great example of the circular loop that is possible within the plastic supply chain and how Norfolk Southern can deliver that resin in a carbon-friendly manner.Finally, 2023 was another successful year for the Norfolk Southern Industrial Development team. We partnered with 62 customers to facilitate the completion of strategic industrial development projects in 2023. Collectively, these projects represent $3.1 billion in customer investment and the creation of more than 4,150 new jobs along Norfolk Southern lines. As we look into 2024, we're encouraged by the continued robust pipeline of customers that are looking to locate facilities along our lines. These successes in 2023 are indicative of the success that we expect in '24 and demonstrates our strategy to deliver a better way forward for our customers, our communities and for our shareholders.With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""We overcame a number of challenges in 2023 and we are moving forward with confidence. Our resolve to deliver on all aspects of our strategy has never been stronger. We restored service and improved safety in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and long-term shareholder value. We ended 2023 with the best intermodal service we've seen in years and with an encouraging 5% increase in intermodal volume. Now we enter 2024 with a fluid network, which will drive productivity gains and further growth this year.Turning to our outlook. We anticipate roughly 3 points of revenue growth in 2024. This growth, combined with our productivity initiatives, will yield strong accretive incremental margins with operating income growing in excess of revenues. Net income and EPS growth will be suppressed in 2024 versus 2023, owing to higher interest expense from the highly strategic acquisition of CSR, along with the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As for the progression through the year, typical seasonality suggests that second quarter and third quarter should be our strongest in terms of margin performance.Obviously, the first quarter will have some industry-wide impact, from widespread cold weather in January, and our first quarter still has year-over-year headwinds from storage fees, fuel revenue and export coal price. In line with the Investor Day guidance, over the midterm horizon, we anticipate delivering strong incremental margins, presuming a normal freight cycle and mix and 3 to 4 points of revenue growth. A combination of volume absorption, productivity initiatives and a commitment to cost control will be key drivers.We aren't going to give you a specific margin target but it should result in between 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement annually, on the pathway to narrow the margin gap with peers and deliver industry competitive margins. You'll start to see progress along those lines in 2024 once we lap some of the revenue compare challenges in the first half. We see a path to outsized gains on the up cycle, leveraging volume growth within existing resources, ample productivity runway, and strong core pricing that can outpace inflation pressures. As we narrow our margin gap over time, the secular growth prospects of our powerful franchise will deliver shareholder value through earnings momentum and free cash flow generation. And with that, let's open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to 1 question each to accommodate as many participants as possible.Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.', 'Christian F. Wetherbee', ""I wanted to think a little bit about the bigger picture here, Alan. You talked about the 100 to 150 basis points of OR opportunity per year over a 3-year period. As we kind of think about you guys relative to some of your closer peers, that's about half of the gap that exists today. So I guess as you think over, is there more opportunity beyond that? It just takes time to get there? Do you think that there's still -- there is the potential for a structural gap between you and your closest geographic peer? Just want to get a sense of how you think about the opportunity maybe beyond that 3 years and how it might play out."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Chris, we've committed to industry competitive margins. And in '23, we overcame a lot. We made a lot of progress on our strategic plan. We enhanced safety, we improved service, we attracted new business, we overcame challenges. As we look into '24, it's really a focus on productivity. And we feel like we're going to be on that pathway of 100 to 150 basis points a year, particularly as we get into the second half of the year and lap some of these revenue comps. But we gave a 3-year outlook but that's not an endpoint. We have talked about continuous productivity improvement as one of the 3 components of our balanced strategy of safe service, continuous productivity improvement and smart growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.', 'Kenneth Scott Hoexter', ""I guess I'm still surprised by that time frame, right? It should seem like there's still moves that would get you that leverage a bit quicker, I guess, just compared to some moves we've seen some other rails. So maybe just was the impetus for some of these changes, the headcount, the 3-year OR targets, there's been some activist chatter in the market, is that something that's edging you behind in terms of making some of these changes? And then I guess, ultimately, the question is, is pricing accretive to margins in '24?"", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Ken, our -- with us entering the third year of a freight recession, with the investments that we've made in safety and service that are delivering meaningful results, it's clear that our cost structure is too high for our revenue base and in 2024. And so we address service, we address safety, we addressed growth in '23. We did it in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and our shareholders. Now as we enter 2024, we've got a much more fluid network, much safer network, a network that is attracting growth, and it's a focus on productivity.And so yes, we're looking at every cost out there. And we're looking at discretionary costs. We're looking at management costs. And we're focused on productivity, because it is a balanced plan.I'll let Ed talk about price."", 'Claude E. Elkins', ""Yes. We were successful in '23 on price, and in '24, we have a good price plan that's strong and really is going to produce value every quarter this year. So we feel good about where we are with price. And there's a couple of things that I'll add to that. We're feeling really good about where we are with our service trajectory at this point. We're hearing from customers that they appreciate the value that we're providing for them. And we're doing it at the facility level, going out and talking to customers focused on that first and final mile and how we add value. And that's going to produce value for us and for our shareholders all year long."", 'Kenneth Scott Hoexter', ""I appreciate it. And I know one question but I'm just trying to understand, are you saying then we get better margins in '24? Is that pricing outpacing that cost? I just -- sorry, just trying to understand the answer there, Ed."", 'Mark R. George', ""That's part of the equation. That's part of the equation, for sure."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', ""So Alan, you've been telling us for a little while now that maybe we'll see weaker decrementals at the trough but then we'll see better incrementals on the way back up. I think about Q4 where we started to see the way back up, we saw some pretty good volume growth, and the incremental margins were still really muted even with a nice fuel ag tailwind. So how do I think about why we didn't see it this quarter? And then maybe just going forward, you just said the cost structure is too high. I don't know that I heard that you're telling us that costs come down from here though. Maybe I misheard or do costs come down from here? And then I don't know, just to put it all together, Mark, sometimes you just give us some color on near-term OpEx and margin, how to think about Q1, that would be helpful."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Yes, Scott. We had to overcome a lot in '23. And we made investments in a prudent manner to enhance safety, enhance service and attract growth, particularly in our most service-sensitive markets. And so we're -- with respect, we're putting proof points up on the board. As we moved through into the fourth quarter, we were still wrestling with a service product that was off plan, which adds complexity, adds variability and adds costs. We're operating in a really tough freight environment. And we were dealing with pretty healthy year-over-year inflation. And we're still lapping some difficult comps with respect to the fuel surcharge revenue and with respect to storage revenue, right?"", 'Mark R. George', 'And mix.', 'Alan H. Shaw', ""And mix. And so as we move into '24, those things are going to start to unwind themselves, right? We've got a much more fluid network. We're operating on plan. That will drive out our service recovery costs. And then after that, we're going to continue to iterate to our plan. That's going to help drive productivity. And we're going to attract new business. And as you noted, our strategy is all about outperforming during an up market. I don't see that in the next 6 months, when the economy does recover, it always does, when the freight market does recover, and it always does, we're going to be cold for growth."", 'Scott H. Group', ""Mark, any color on the OpEx, the OR Q1 again? I just -- I didn't -- I don't know that -- I asked, I mean, you said the cost structure is too high. Does it come down or not? I guess I'm not -- still not sure what the answer is."", 'Mark R. George', ""So I think as you go into Q1, you're going to have some of the normal seasonality that has an impact on your OR. So I think you need to expect that the first half, Q1 in particular, is probably going to step back. But then we feel much better as we lap a lot of the headwinds that we've been talking about from this first half, the intermodal storage charges, some of the fuel price and some of the other RPU challenges we're having on coal price. I think as we get to that back half is where you're going to really start to see much stronger incrementals and drop-through."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.', 'Amit Singh Mehrotra', ""I guess, Alan, if we look at the 3-year plan, I think if you ask every railroad in North America, they tell you that they also would expect to improve margins by 100 to 150 basis points a year from where we are today. So I guess the negative implication of that outlook is that you're not actually narrowing the gap. You're just improving your position from where you are but the gap actually stays intact. So I'd be curious to get your perspective on that. And I think the cost structure is high, which is you're addressing that by taking these difficult actions with nonsalaried workers and I know that's a really difficult decision. But it seems also like -- when I look at the cost structure, it seems like the answer to something going wrong is growing as many resources at that problem as possible. If I look at materials expense or rent expense. And if I talk to any operating intensive railroad, their answer is you never really drown a problem with resources. That's the opposite of what you should do. So I'm trying to understand the removal of the nonunion or the rationalization of the nonunion employees is one step in that direction. But are we having to rethink about how we actually operate the railroad day in and day at and how we respond to issues because it seems like that's kind of the root cause of the problem in terms of where the gap is today? Sorry for the long-winded question but I just want to get your perspective on that."", 'Alan H. Shaw', 'What was the first part of your question?', 'Amit Singh Mehrotra', ""Well, just in terms of the -- yes, sure, Alan. The 3-year outlook, 100 to 150 basis points, every rail on the continent will think that, so you're not actually narrowing the gap. So that was the question."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Well, that's our commitment. Our commitment is industry competitive margins and top-tier revenue and earnings growth. And we said we're going to do that through an economic cycle. We said we would have difficulty within the industry competitive margins during a trough in the freight market. And candidly, we didn't expect some of the incidents that occurred in 2023, the network disruptions, the Eastern Ohio incident, and a continuation of a very difficult truck market. We invested throughout 2023 for the long term -- in the long-term best interest of Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. And we improved service, we improved safety, volumes grew in the fourth quarter. Now we can really narrow our focus, right? We can narrow our focus into productivity. And that's exactly what we're doing. And we're going to drive that by operating to the plan, a high degree of compliance to the plan. That will shed resources. That's going to shed a lot of the service recovery resources that you just referenced. As we get on plan, we'll continue to iterate the plan and look for additional ways to drive out complexity, drive out costs and improve balance."", 'Paul B. Duncan', ""And just adding to what Alan said, as we think back to the fourth quarter, it was all about driving intermodal service, recognizing that the service sensitivity to that was going to directly drive growth of this railroad, which we did see. The shift in the layering on now is towards driving that discipline and rigor inside of our merchandise network. We recognize that is where our single biggest opportunity is.Total T&E as a result of that essentially troughed in October. And we expect that we're going to see greater productivity as we continue to dial in our merchandise network, that's going to be a reduced number of recrews and all of the associated costs: taxis, hotels, [deadheading], overtime, car hire, equipment expense. We're going to see improved capacity in our merchandise network as cars per carload improves. So that's the flywheel impact that we're talking about. So to your question about what is fundamentally changing moving forward, it's from where we are now moving forward, a direct focus on merchandise recognizing. That's our next single biggest lever for productivity."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""That's where 2/3 of our operating costs are."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.', 'Jonathan B. Chappell', ""I hate to keep on the guidance a bit but I'm going to move up to the revenue line here. I'm just trying to understand the roughly 3%. I get that there's macro headwinds. I understand the first half may be difficult. But by the same token, you have incredibly easy volume comps given all the disruption from February until August. And Ed talked about the continuation of the pricing above inflation. So one would probably expect the volumes to be a little bit better than 3% just given the comparison. So are we saying that all-in yield may be down this year? Or is there just like a healthy element of conservatism that you're putting into the macro economy in the first half of the year that may be temping that number down?"", 'Claude E. Elkins', ""I think -- this is Ed, by the way. There is a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen here in the first half of the year. I think the Street's baked a lot of expectations around Fed actions and we'll see where that goes. But frankly, you look at first quarter and we see a pretty sedate volume opportunities here in the first quarter and the recent weather events for the entire industry has kind of confirmed that. But then we see a steady progression of volume improvement throughout the year. And I think volume improvement will probably lead the parade, so to speak, in terms of revenue and yield improvement for us. But we're pretty confident we might be conservative around coal price, but that's I think the right thing to do for ourselves as well as for the rest of the industry."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.', 'Thomas Richard Wadewitz', ""I want to ask you one granular one and then kind of a higher-level one. So I guess on the granular question, for Paul, should we think about, with a fairly muted volume backdrop, that train starts would come down in '24? Or are you thinking kind of, hey, the schedule is set and we'll keep that where it is? And then the higher-level question, I think when investors look at Norfolk, they say, okay, there is a potential idiosyncratic opportunity to run the system better. Maybe that runs on its own regardless of freight market. But I don't know that that's clear. So should we look at it as more of a kind of idio improvement story? Or is this really a freight market, freight cycle leverage story, right? That it's really when the freight market improves, if that second half, is that's '25, then you're just really well positioned for that? So I think just trying to figure out what's really the right way to look at the Norfolk story."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Why don't you address the first question?"", 'Paul B. Duncan', ""Yes, absolutely, Tom. Thanks for the question. So we think about it not just as train starts but overall T&E productivity. It's all about getting the most from our crews. And we're going to see that improve through not only the -- what we've seen here over the past several weeks for improvements in network velocity but running more disciplined to plan and layer down initiatives. We know running more disciplined to plan is already starting to show itself in reductions in T&E expense. You've seen it in the other productivity measures from the slides. We're going to make further iterations to the plan as we get more discipline, particularly in our merchandise network. And that's only going to drive improvements in GTMs per horsepower but also on the T&E side. We've got a number of initiatives beyond just running the plan more disciplined and seeing that cost come out, again, that we're layering on. We've got pool transitions taking place. So as we have gotten more fluid and more consistent, we have transitioned more short-pool runs to long-pool runs, again, because we've got greater consistency and velocity in the network, that has productivity benefits. We have put more towards assigned service from a T&E standpoint. That means we've got assigned crew pools and turns, that reduces hotels, van expenses, has a quality-of-life benefit. We're going to roll out predictable work scheduling this year on our conductors -- or with our conductor, excuse me. More than 80% of our schedule -- our network is scheduled, meaning as we layer in predictable work scheduling, we will see a benefit in reductions in displacement time. We've got a number of board consolidation initiatives that are taking place. And we're driving accountabilities to run lean and to plan inside of our merchandise yard. So that all translates into we're going to see train length on the merchandise side. We've got line of sight on some improvements we can make there, not only through further iterations of the plan. We've also got some investments planned this year in some of our major merch channels that are going to drive productivity and train length. Intermodal train length went up in Q4 as a direct result of us not only delivering great service, but customers rewarding us with business. And again, we're going to continue to work on that. And from a bulk standpoint, you've heard us talk about the various longer-term initiatives we have with our customers to invest in facilities, particularly in our (inaudible) network. Several elevators are investing. And we expect to really see the benefits as that -- those investments come to play."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""And Tom, your second question. As we've lapped -- gone through 2023, and we've made the necessary improvements in safety and service and attractive growth, we can really start to focus on productivity in our own plan and execution of that plan. That provides benefit as well. And then our whole strategy is about outperforming during the up cycle. Our franchise is built to outperform during the up cycle. You've seen us recover from network disruptions much faster than we have in the past. So there's a proof point as well. We're not calling when that up cycle occurs. But when it does, we do believe that we will outperform and we will attract new business with high incremental margins.So it's improving our own operations and executability with the plans as we can now narrow our focus on really operate into the plan and driving efficiencies, and then participating and outperforming during the up cycle."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.', 'Brian Patrick Ossenbeck', ""Just a quick follow-up for Paul. If you can just give us some sense in terms of how much of those productivity metrics you're talking about are actually independent of volume, I'm sure that would help. But how much do you have line of sight if volume stays flat or maybe doesn't recover in the back half? And then just to ask more broadly, do you think there's a structural margin gap that will always be here for this network versus some of your peers? I mean do you have roughly 10 percentage points more intermodal, more truck competitive, you can have shorter length of haul dynamics in international as well, lighter weight, more touches?So I'd just be curious to hear if that's something you think about in the long term in terms of closing that gap that might be a hindrance, or if there's something I'm not thinking about from a productivity density perspective that could make that incorrect assumption."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Brian, each franchise has unique strengths. We have committed to top-tier revenue and top-tier earnings growth coupled with industry competitive margins. We're going to deliver that. We've got a franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy and a franchise that's poised for growth. We're entering the third year of a freight recession. That will unwind. And when it does, the enhancements that we've made to safety, the enhancements that we've made to service, the ability to attract business in the fourth quarter in automotive and intermodal, which are our most service-sensitive markets, right, give us a pathway to success going forward and allow us to unlock our full potential. And Paul and his team and the entire executive team are intently focused on driving out cost inefficiencies and driving productivity."", 'Mark R. George', ""Let me just add real quick. This entire team recognizes that a margin gap exists today between where we are and where we should be. And we're focused intently on closing and narrowing that gap before we get to an area of talking about why any remaining gap exists. There's a lot of runway still for us organically and self-help."", 'Paul B. Duncan', ""Yes. And the specific around how much is initiatives versus volume adjust, many of those initiatives that I spoke to are going to continue regardless of the volume environment. The iterations to the plan are always going to continue. But that is going to be the lever that is most sensitive to volume. But we're going to continue to drive train length. We're going to continue to drive crew productivity regardless of the volume environment."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.', 'Brandon Robert Oglenski', ""And I guess maybe the frustration from the investor side is that if we go back a couple of analyst meeting, and maybe even back to 2015, the mantra here has always been that we're trying to close the gap. But I guess, constructively, Paul or Ed, can you help us understand where you are in trip plan compliance with your customers? Because I think ultimately, it's consistency of service that matters, right? So what can you talk about what did you learn through changing the makeup rules through 2023? And where is the future on service to your customers? What are you seeing today?"", 'Paul B. Duncan', ""Well, let me start off, and I'd love to have Ed jump in here as well. From an intermodal perspective as we look at where we finished fourth quarter, we delivered the best intermodal service we have put across this railroad in several years. And customers rewarded us with volume as a result. We expect to maintain that level of service based on what we've heard from our customers is their expectation. From a merchandise standpoint, we continue to see improvements in merchandise trip plan compliance throughout the year.To your point around the train maker pools, we said that we were going to recover after we had moved forward with those, meant to, again, drive greater safety and resiliency across our network. We feel very confident that we've seen merchandise trip line compliance continue to come up throughout the year, and we feel that we're very confident as we look at 2024, based on the further discipline that we are going to build and drive inside of our merchandise network."", 'Claude E. Elkins', ""I'd offer a couple of proof points, just to think about that are recent. The first one is we have one of our very largest customers comment to us that, emerging from the weather events that just happened in the past year -- or excuse me, the past week, that we recovered better than just about anybody else. And we really take that to heart because they themselves are a broad survey of many other railroads. So we think that that's really important as a proof point for resilience. As we return back to plan faster and faster after inevitable events, that's going to define a large part of the value that we're offering customers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc.', 'Justin Trennon Long', ""So for 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces that you've talked about. But when you put it all together, do you think you'll be within that targeted longer-term range of 100 to 150 basis points of annual improvement in the OR? And Mark, I think you and Alan both mentioned the interest expense headwind you'll have this year. I was wondering if you could help quantify that year-over-year headwind."", 'Mark R. George', ""Yes. Thanks, Justin. Let's be explicit with interest. We've got -- we ended 2023 with about $17.2 billion of outstanding debt. The effective interest rate is about 4.7%. So I would model about $210 million a quarter for interest expense on the go forward. We've essentially kind of prefunded that CSR acquisition. So that should be relatively steady within a couple of few million dollars per quarter of that. And as we look at the moving pieces, again, we've got some headwinds here in the first half. I think as volume starts to grow as we go from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, we should really start to see with the compares a pretty good improvement year-over-year.So I don't see so much in the first quarter, certainly. I think there's a risk of regression there. But I think as we navigate the second quarter depending on volumes, but in particular, in the second half, is where you'll see most of the improvement. And look, I think that 100, 150 that we're talking about kind of on the go-forward, we should definitely be there in the back half. Whether it translates into a full year amount or not, I think, depends on a number of other factors."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.', 'Jason H. Seidl', ""I'll put the bat away for the horse that is guidance here and turn the attention a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of impacts from any diversions on the port side, whether they're from geopolitical events from the Panama Canal. And if you haven't seen them yet, do you expect to see them? And what sort of impact should we look for going forward?"", 'Alan H. Shaw', 'Ed, what do you hear from customers?', 'Claude E. Elkins', ""We're talking to our customers a lot about this. It's a situation that has grown over time. We haven't seen any impact yet to our volumes. In fact, our East Coast port volumes continue to be remarkably strong. And we are hearing customers start to evaluate their West Coast options, and that makes sense given some rather unprecedented things that are going on. But regardless, the great thing about our network is we're well-positioned to pick up that volume growth, whether it comes in the East Coast or the West Coast. And I think we're going to be able to very ably serve our customers and satisfy their needs."", 'Jason H. Seidl', 'Ed, is there a preference on East Coast versus West Coast in the network?', 'Claude E. Elkins', ""Well, there's all kinds of preferences. But no, we've got the network built for -- to take on volume, whether it comes through the East Coast or the West Coast. I think there's probably more intermodal conversion opportunity when it comes through the West Coast. But we've gotten very good at doing short-haul intermodal with our international customers."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Frankly, that's one of the benefits of our franchise, right? We got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, which serves 60% of the consumers. So no matter whatever comes in the East Coast or West Coast, we're going to handle it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.', 'Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic', 'So with the focus on long-term growth, could you maybe talk to the growth investment embedded in CapEx? Is it higher, is it lower? And then with that longer-term margin road map, is there an offset embedded in that, given just sort of the ongoing investment in service that (inaudible) is making? Just any thoughts there.', 'Alan H. Shaw', 'Mark, do you want to talk about the capital program, please?', 'Mark R. George', ""Yes. The capital -- I mean, the capital guidance actually for '23, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that was going to be largely flat with 2022. And I would say that the mix within that, between reinvesting in the business and safety and resilience, it's about the same as what it was in '22, call it, about 60%, 65%, and the growth element to that is the balance, call it, 35%, and that's pretty consistent between the 2 years, Allison. Second part of your question, again, I don't recall."", 'Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic', ""Yes. Just in that longer-term margin road map, obviously, you're investing in service. Is there sort of an offset embedded in that margin just given this ongoing investment, it just certainly doesn't end here. Just trying to think through that."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Well, I know that a faster network is a less expensive network. So as we invest in service and we invest in resiliency, it translates to fewer recrews, fewer network disruptions, fewer -- less overtime, less equipment rents, improved fuel consumption and fuel efficiency. So yes, that's the part of our franchise -- or pardon me, of our strategy, right, is that balance between service productivity and growth, and they build on each other."", 'Paul B. Duncan', 'The velocity piece plays into the growth.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.', 'Jordan Robert Alliger', ""Just a couple of clarifications or make sure I understand. In terms of thinking about this year, in light of the -- you mentioned steadily increasing volume assumptions and then increasing incrementals, particularly in the second half and the year-over-year improvement in margin notably in the second half. I guess the question is, what needs to happen to do better than the 100 to 150, the longer-term target? I would imagine part of the plan for the back half of this year is probably to exceed that, I would think. And then secondarily, can you give a little more color around the use of cash this year? I think you said you're suspending the buyback but the interest expense is pretty high. So is debt reduction part of it? Because I think you also mentioned you want to get the liquidity ratios more in line. So maybe where do you hope to end the year on that front?"", 'Mark R. George', ""Yes, Jordan, on the cash side, we've got the big CSR purchase here in March. We've gone outside of our preferred debt-to-EBITDA range at the very end of the year, in part because we've had to also fund these ballasting costs. So that will continue to consume some cash as well in 2024. And then we've got the CSR purchase in addition to that. There are no debt redemptions planned this year. So it's really an issue of operating cash, minus CapEx, gets you to free cash flow. And then in that free cash flow, we've got our CapEx budget, which is flat with last year as well as the CSR purchase.From there, we don't expect to have remaining cash to do share repurchase. So as we go into 2025, we should be in a better track with EBITDA growth to start to have a more normal capital allocation cycle like we've experienced in the past."", 'Jordan Robert Alliger', 'And then just the first part.', 'Mark R. George', ""Yes, why don't you repeat the first part?"", 'Jordan Robert Alliger', ""Yes. I mean, you've mentioned a few times that you expect steadily increasing volumes and steady increasing incrementals as we move through the year, with the second half seeing the lion's share, I suppose, of the margin improvement. So I guess I'm just curious, would the plan contemplate in excess of the 100 to 150 in the back half? And what needs to happen to do that? I assume it's volume, but..."", 'Mark R. George', ""Yes. So Jordan, I think as you look at it, one thing that's going to happen on the cost side is the service costs that I laid out in my chart will come out. They may not come out as great in the first quarter, largely because of what we're doing to mitigate the cold weather but they're going to come out. And they're going to start coming out in the first quarter. And the plan is that most of those will start to release here in the second quarter, if not be completely gone. So that provides us some traction for sure. A lot of the other fluidity and improvements that Paul mentioned will start to really take hold and provide traction where we actually think our T&E counts may end the year a little bit lower than where they started the year, which means you're taking on more volume and you're actually having perhaps fewer crews, that's embedded productivity right there. And then, of course, we're doing actions on the nonagreement side that will also yield some benefits. So we feel really good about our back half and our margin profile. I think a little bit stronger revenue, we can absolutely outperform that 150 in the back half -- the 100 to 150 in the back half and possibly be there for the full year because of it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ravi Shanker', ""Maybe just a high-level question here, and maybe going back to some of the previous questions asked and just tying it up. I mean, look, there's always a margin gap to your peers, and it's kind of easy to point to cost as a reason why. But you guys have been cutting costs for many years and you've taken a lot of resources down and you've done a lot to improve the service product. I think you have the lowest cost per carload of any of your peers. At what point is this not really a cost problem and it's more of a revenue problem and that needs the bulk of the resources addressing that rather than trying to take out more cost?"", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""Look, it's a balanced approach, and we overcame a lot of Norfolk Southern specific headwinds in 2023. And we enter 2024 and with a safer network, a more fluid network and a network that is attracting business from our most service-sensitive customers. Once we get through this freight recession, and we will, we are poised for outperformance during the up cycle. That is the essence of our strategy. We're doing what we laid out at our Investor Day 14 months ago. And I'm proud of the way that we've overcome these obstacles in 2023 and set the stage for margin improvement in 2024, while protecting the best long-term interest of our shareholders and the Norfolk Southern franchise."", 'Mark R. George', ""Yes. Make no mistake, Ravi, this franchise, this network is built to handle a lot more volume but we have a lot of cost runway ahead of us. And that's what we're focused on right now and we're certainly going to welcome the revenue when it comes. And I think, again, that's going to drive the high incrementals at that point. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein.', 'David Scott Vernon', 'Mark, on the topic of costs, I think there were some headlines last night about some headcount actions nonunion workforce. Is there a specific cost program in place with a quantifiable number that we can be thinking about in terms of pursuit of sort of the nonoperational costs as we kind of await the flywheel is starting to spin?', 'Mark R. George', ""Well, with regard to the nonagreement program, maybe I'm going to assume that's what you're referring to, we had mentioned about 7% was our target and that's going to yield over 300 people. And -- but I think the timing will probably start to take effect here in the second quarter, just the way the voluntary program works. So we'll start to see the cost relief take place here in the second quarter. And frankly, the savings amount will depend upon the mix of the folks that put their names in. So we certainly internally have a number in mind and we'll see where it settles after that. But we're going to -- but aside from that, there are other areas we're going to go after. Again, we're not happy with our Purchased service spend. We were in a year of very, very difficult, challenging situation where we had to quickly get our network up and running again from a number of challenges, be it weather or accidents. So we've put a lot of money into quickly revamp -- using some outside services to quickly revamp our network on the mechanical side as well as engineering side. I would hope that those things start to really settle down. That's our focus, Paul and I, as well as even on the technology spend, where we've been using a lot more software as a service -- cloud-based services which show up in purchased services as opposed to CapEx. So that's been putting pressure on our Purchased services. But we've got to try to, again, put a lid on that growth. And I will mention that can't discount inflation. Inflation in 2023 was well over 4% in our cost structure. As we go into 2024, I expect to see inflation maybe be half of that impact. So that's going to be another area of tailwind. So thanks for the question, David."", 'David Scott Vernon', ""That's helpful. And maybe just to squeeze one in here. On the CSR purchase. Obviously, you're going to be adding depreciation on the rent side. Is there any sort of like net benefit of owning that property versus just renting? Or is this just more about avoiding future lease payments?"", 'Mark R. George', ""Yes. Look, I think the biggest issue is these costs could have quickly run away from us upon lease renewal. We did not control what the lease rate was going to be and we knew that would go to arbitration, and it could be a significant multiple of where we were. So it's really a benefit when you think about what it could be on the go forward, overall. There is some above-the-line benefits that we have in our depreciation today that lessen as well as the rent payment that goes away. But again, the interest burden and a pause on share repurchase provides a temporary hurdle for us.All right. We've got it wrong. We've got another question before we wrap up here."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Walter Noel Spracklin', ""So Alan, I just want to understand, again, at the end of the day here, you're talking about top tier volume growth at industry competitive margins. And when I look at industry competitive margins, say, consensus estimates for next year, it's in 60% to 61% range of OR for each of the -- each of your peers. And even if they do nothing and they don't move in their OR at all, and I just take the midpoint of your 100, 150, I mean that's 6 years before you can get to industry competitive margins. So is that what we're communicating here? Is that the setup? Or we just look -- am I looking at it the wrong way? Maybe you can help me there."", 'Alan H. Shaw', ""That's -- we've given you a road map for the next 3 years on how we're going to narrow the gap with our peers with respect to margin. Our commitment is industry competitive margins. We've given you an outline of where we're headed based on where we see markets, if there's more lift in the freight market, then I fully expect that we're going to outperform because our investments in safety and service and our ability to attract growth in the fastest-growing markets, in the most service-sensitive markets are going to yield outsized benefits to Norfolk Southern and our shareholders during an up cycle. But we're not calling that yet."", 'Operator', 'Our final question this morning comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group.', 'Bascome Majors', ""Mark, you've been candid about the lumpy legal outflows and the insurance inflows on the cash flow front you're going to see from the Eastern Ohio incident and how that's going to be with you for some time here. But as we think about the cost structure, can you talk a little more about the ongoing operating cost increases that came from that, and how fully burdened what we saw in the fourth quarter was for that, and what may still be ahead? And I'm thinking things like insurance premiums or depreciation or say, maintenance or testing contracts but really anything you can share on the ongoing cost increase and how far along we are in that process, would be really helpful."", 'Mark R. George', ""So I'm interpreting the question beyond the East Palestine specific impacts that we reported and kind of the after-effects of it that are in the operating results. And I'll ask Paul to help. But clearly, there were impacts that consequential from East Palestine where we accelerated those train makeup rule changes that certainly had an impact in the second quarter and probably going into the third quarter. I think we've ingested that now. And that's no longer really providing any adverse impact. We have installed more additional wayside detectors that we're carrying. We're doing more testing. We've got some more people monitoring our wayside deaths, et cetera. I wouldn't say that the incremental direct safety costs that come out of EP are consequential. And frankly, I think, ultimately, they're going to yield to better results in the go forward because we are running a safer railroad, we're having much better derailment experience in terms of less frequency as a result of some of the operational changes, including the makeup rules, have had. So overall, there's probably some -- for sure, some lingering incremental costs because we're doing things different but there will be a benefit longer term.Paul, do you want to add anything?"", 'Paul B. Duncan', ""Yes. I'll just add. Thanks, Mark. The proof is in the pudding that we saw a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate this year. So as Alan described, part of our strategy has been to safely deliver reliable and resilient service, and 2023 was a challenging year for us but those are the types of things that are going to move the needle in driving towards we have a safer, more resilient product on the railroad. So yes, there are going to be some of those costs, as Mark just outlined very well that remain embedded with the offset being we're going to see and deliver a safer product for our customers and through the communities that we serve."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for final comments."", 'Alan H. Shaw', 'Thank you for joining us today.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Let's take a closer look at which is the better stock to buy right now."", ""Coke's latest results show off several of its major competitive strengths. Beverages are a consumer staple niche, and that factor has helped sales rise even as shoppers pulled back on other spending areas in recent months. Coke's organic revenue was up 11% year over year last quarter, beating management's expectations."", ""Home Depot competes in a more discretionary industry, as evidenced by management's forecast of a roughly 4% comparable-store sales drop in fiscal 2023. Do-it-yourself projects have been downsized compared to 2022, and shoppers aren't spending as much on big-ticket items like appliances. Sales are down 3% over the first three quarters of 2023. Most Wall Street pros expect the chain to boost revenue by less than 2% next year, trailing Coke's results."", ""Coke has more pricing power in this environment, and you can see proof of that fact in its rising prices and in Coke's market-leading 30% operating profit margin. Home Depot is faring better than its main rival Lowe's in the profitability department, but it is still struggling with flat average spending per visit and declining customer traffic."", ""Ironically, Home Depot seems better positioned for improving earnings over the medium term. A lot of its pricing challenges stem from deflation in lumber prices, which won't last forever. And the chain is doing a stellar job at generating cash, having recently set a new annual record."", 'These metrics imply that Home Depot will enjoy a sharp earnings rebound once conditions stabilize in the home improvement market. Coca-Cola, in contrast, is likely to post consistently positive, but often weaker, profit trends.', ""Two other factors count in Coke's favor. Its shares come with a meatier yield today, and the company has a much longer track record of consecutive annual payout hikes. Coke has boosted its dividend for more than 60 straight years, while Home Depot had to pause its increase during the worst of the Great Recession. That suspension put the chain behind rival Lowe's, which has kept its payout steadily rising for just over 50 years."", ""Ultimately, most income investors will prefer Coca-Cola stock for its more predictable sales, steadier earnings, and longer dividend-track record. If you prefer long-term growth and don't mind taking on higher risk, then Home Depot is a fine choice.

These global franchises allow it to sell over 2 billion drinks per day across its vast network that spans restaurants, fast-food chains, theme parks, convenience stores, and more.', ""You might be surprised to learn that Coke doesn't make most of its money from the sales of those sparkling beverages. In fact, about 60% of its revenue comes from another source entirely."", ""Coke counted $43 billion of revenue in the most recent full fiscal year, up from $39 billion in the prior year. You can see that it's a truly global business from the breakdown of those sales, too. Coke generated $28 billion, or 65% of revenue, from outside of the United States. You'll find Coke products relatively easily in over 200 countries."", 'Yet the beverage titan doesn\'t make much from the actual sparkling drinks you might buy at a fast-food chain or sporting event. These products, which executives refer to as ""finished beverages,"" account for just 44% of Coca-Cola\'s sales. The bigger proportion comes from the company\'s massive concentrate operations that deliver the remaining 56% of annual sales.', ""This segment of Coke's business involves the sale of concentrates and syrups that contain all the flavorings needed to make one of its drinks. Even a small container of concentrate can make over 100 servings of finished sodas once it is mixed with sparkling water at the point of sale."", ""There are lots of benefits to selling drinks this way. Coke doesn't need to ship the water that accounts for over 80% of a beverage's bulk, for example. It doesn't have to worry about securing that water, infusing it with carbon dioxide, or shipping the finished drinks in a way that preserves that carbonation in plastic bottles or aluminum cans."", ""And Coke generates much higher earnings from its concentrate sales. That's a big factor behind the company's 60% gross profit margin that's well ahead of PepsiCo's (NASDAQ: PEP) rate. Pepsi sells more of its beverages in a finished state on account of its bigger sales presence in grocery stores. It also has a large snacks and packaged foods business that produces weaker profitability than Coke's concentrate sales."", 'Coke is enjoying strong operating momentum heading into 2024, with organic sales on track to rise by between 10% and 11%. Management hiked that outlook in late October after sales volumes increased by a healthy 2%. Executives also lifted their earnings forecast to call for a boost of as much as 14%.', 'Wall Street has been down on the stock despite those positive trends. Many investors have been gravitating toward faster-growing stocks in the tech industry, after all. But Coke is on pace for another good growth year in 2024 and another year of rising dividends.

All in, Coca-Cola looks like it is trading at a reasonable price, not at a deep value."", 'Another option for investors looking at the consumer staples space is Hormel Foods, which is not getting a lot of love on Wall Street these days.', 'To offer some key comparison points, Hormel is also a Dividend King with 57 consecutive years of annual dividend increases behind it.

That's interesting on an absolute level, but there's an important thing to consider: In recent history, Hormel's yield has never been higher than it is right now. That suggests that Hormel is trading at deeply depressed prices, unlike Coca-Cola. That's backed up by notably below-average valuation metrics."", ""There are reasons why investors are so downbeat on Hormel. For example, it hasn't been as successful as its peers at passing inflation-driven price increases on to customers. Avian flu has been a headwind to the company's turkey operations for a couple of years. The recent Planters acquisition has come at a time when the nut segment has been weak."", ""And growth in China hasn't lived up to expectations as the country moved past COVID-19-related lockdowns."", ""Hormel isn't the only company facing these types of issues, but it is probably the only one facing them all at the same time. That said, if you look at each problem individually, none of the headwinds is likely to be permanent. They all just require some time to work through."", ""Given the company's impressive history, highlighted by its status as a Dividend King, it seems very likely that it will muddle through all of this. And assuming that happens, Wall Street will likely reward the stock with a higher valuation."", ""It's not like it would be a disastrous mistake to buy Coca-Cola. It's a well-run company that seems fairly valued today -- and maybe even a little cheap."", 'But if you prefer to buy your stocks when everyone else is selling, Hormel has more going for it, including an equally strong track record as a business, a higher absolute yield, and a higher historical yield.

The retailer is projecting an earnings decline this fiscal year, likely constraining management's next dividend increase. Coke is expecting to boost profits at a double-digit rate, on the other hand."", 'Investors might still prefer Home Depot for its brighter long-term growth outlook.

You may begin.', 'Andy Taylor', ""Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish."", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $839 million or $1.15 per diluted share on net sales of $7.7 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2023 earnings totaled $749 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $219 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding a net after-tax benefit of $98 million for special items, we earned $121 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $321 million.I'll start this morning by thanking our employees for their solid execution and performance in 2023. Through their collective efforts, we delivered industry-leading operating performance, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful advancements across our multiyear targets. As we enter 2024, we're well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and remain focused on driving superior long-term value for our shareholders.As highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slides, we generated $986 million of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2023. We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.14 per share. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.76 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $0.90 per share. Including $125 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $783 million of total cash to shareholders based on 2023 results or approximately 80% of 2023 adjusted FAD, which is at the high end of our annual target payout range.As summarized on Page 20, upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned $4.6 billion in total cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchase since the first full year of our new cash framework in 2021. It's worth noting that although our adjusted FAD in 2023 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate that our cash return framework is both sustainable and appropriate for the company's portfolio and the cash flow that we generate from our businesses across market cycles. Notably, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% in 2023 and returned additional cash through share repurchase in our supplemental dividend. The additional cash was fully funded within our framework and required no balance sheet or portfolio actions to cover our return commitment.And given the design of our framework, we retain 20% to 25% of our adjusted FAD annually, all of which can be utilized as we evaluate future capital allocation levers, including strategic growth opportunities. We continue to believe this framework is a powerful differentiator, one that enhances our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a variety of market conditions and also delivers an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders.Before moving on to business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on the purchase and sale transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter, which included the acquisition of high-quality timberlands in the Carolinas and Mississippi and the divestiture of less strategic acreage in upstate South Carolina. These transactions represent a unique opportunity to further optimize our Southern Timberlands portfolio with high-quality, highly productive acreage that is well integrated with our existing operations. And these transactions were structured in a tax-efficient like-kind exchange, resulting in a net cash inflow of $7 million. The gain was recorded on the sale transaction and reported as a special item in the fourth quarter.As highlighted on Page 22, we're progressing nicely against our target to grow our Timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $530 million towards our goal, including announced acquisitions in Washington, the Carolinas and Mississippi.With that, I'll now turn to fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Excluding special items, Timberlands contributed $77 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million and results across all Timberlands regions were comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log demand and pricing faced downward pressure at the outset of the fourth quarter as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, lumber takeaway improved slightly and log supply decreased seasonally. Despite lower log prices during the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increased mix of grade logs.Our domestic sales volumes were lower in the fourth quarter as we shifted volume to China to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower compared to the third quarter.Moving to the Western export business. In Japan, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, inventories of European lumber imports have largely normalized, and the Japanese log market returned to a more balanced state in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the third quarter. Our Japanese sales volumes were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and continued to be impacted by reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at one of its sawmills in the third quarter of last year. That said, this customer has implemented plans to recover most of the lost production, and we continue to shift volume to other customers in Japan. As a result, we expect to increase our export volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter.In China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels, and the market was largely balanced in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were comparable to the third quarter. Given steady demand from our Chinese customers, coupled with moderating market conditions in Western domestic market, we significantly increased our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter.Turning to the South. Southern sawlog and fiber markets softened slightly in the fourth quarter, largely in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations and fee harvest volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower.Turning now to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $320 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $50 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, a $27 million decrease compared to the third quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased from the prior quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to see stable interest from buyers for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 23, our full year adjusted EBITDA was $47 million. This represents a 9% increase compared to 2022 and a 114% increase since the inception of this business in 2020. For 2023, we achieved solid contributions from conservation, mitigation banking and renewables, and demand for these businesses continues to grow. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our forest carbon business in 2023, including the approval of our pilot project in Maine and the monetization of the initial credits from this project. These credits were sold in the fourth quarter at a strong price and demonstrate our commitment to offering only the highest-quality credits to the market. Looking forward, we expect the new issuance of credits from our Maine project later this year. Further, we're developing additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands. We anticipate receiving approval on 2 projects in the U.S. South in early '24 and intend to monetize additional credits in the voluntary market this year.Turning to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to see solid progress being made on the projects we've announced with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Exxon, and both are expected to be online in late 2025 or 2026. Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality CCS developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future.As we look back over the last several years, I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made in our Natural Climate Solutions business and the leadership we've demonstrated along the way. We were the first company in our space to embark on this journey in a comprehensive manner and had delivered notable accomplishments across all of our NCS businesses. And in the process, we built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and a strong commercial focus. We've laid the foundation to develop and advance our NCS offerings in-house, allowing Weyerhaeuser to capture the vast majority of the economics associated with these opportunities. And we've quickly established a peer-leading position in emerging carbon markets.As we think about the future, we remain focused on growing our NCS business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025, and we see significant future upside as markets continue to develop, particularly in carbon and renewables. And with the work we've already completed and the prospects of advancing NCS across our expansive timberland holdings, we have a lot of conviction that there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser.So now moving on to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $105 million to earnings before special items in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million, a 52% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by lower commodity pricing. Starting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $34 million loss. Weaker product pricing was the primary driver as the framing lumber composite posted its lowest quarterly average in a number of years. Our average sales realizations decreased 14% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by cautious buyer sentiment and ample lumber supply in the North American market.That said, buyer sentiment and product pricing started to improve toward the end of the year, following stronger-than-expected housing starts data and positive signals from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rates. Our fourth quarter performance was further impacted by a decrease in production levels, which resulted in lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs. This was largely driven by a combination of taking additional holiday downtime at our Pacific Northwest mills, a period of downtime at our mill in British Columbia and operating challenges at certain facilities. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the Northwest in the fourth quarter, given the more rapid decline in lumber pricing compared to log prices.As we enter 2024, market conditions are starting to improve, and we expect stronger performance from our lumber business in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB was $73 million, a decrease of $45 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter on a downward trajectory but stabilized by the end of October and increased through year-end. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and a resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our OSB pricing exited the quarter at a higher level than where we entered. However, our fourth quarter average realizations decreased by 17% compared to the prior quarter. Our sales volumes and fiber costs were comparable to the third quarter, and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower.Engineered Wood Products delivered $104 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of $21 million compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. I would note, however, that pricing remains quite healthy on a historical basis. Sales volumes were lower for most products compared to the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower demand and improving supply across the EWP market. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly lower in the fourth quarter, and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock.In distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased $15 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a decrease in commodity realizations and seasonally lower sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2024 outlook."", 'David M. Wold', ""Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $288 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $1.4 billion. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $783 million to shareholders based on 2023 results, which includes $125 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $15 million, and we have now completed approximately $750 million of activity under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Entering 2024, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $102 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. In December, we repaid our $860 million, 5.2% private note at maturity and also closed on a 5-year $250 million variable rate term loan. This completes a series of transactions over the course of the year, along with our $750 million bond issuance in May to refinance approximately $1 billion of debt. We ended the year with gross debt of $5.1 billion, consistent with our total as of the prior year-end, and we have no further debt maturities until 2025.Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $8 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2024 are presented on Pages 24 and 25. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023.Turning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady log demand in the domestic market in the first quarter as mills respond to seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. That said, we anticipate a slight decrease in our overall and our average domestic sales realizations largely driven by a lower mix of grade logs. Absent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. And forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we expect to deliver higher sales volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. This is largely in response to measures taken by one of our customers to increase production following a fire at their sawmill in the third quarter of last year. With a more balanced Japanese log market and improving conditions in the Western domestic market, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations for our export logs into Japan in the first quarter.In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.Turning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern log markets are expected to be fairly stable in the first quarter as mills respond to a seasonal reduction in log supply and the prospect of increased demand for finished goods. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter, and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2024, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35.5 million tons, with all regions delivering slightly higher volumes compared to 2023 levels.Moving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2024 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we anticipate a significant increase in EBITDA in 2024 as we continue to advance toward our $100 million target. For the segment, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $320 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $15 million higher primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.Turning to our Wood Products segment. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB have increased from lower levels in the fourth quarter but have remained fairly stable over the last several weeks. As the quarter progresses, we expect improving market conditions and demand for both products heading into the spring building season. Excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings before special items to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating conditions improve. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower, primarily in Canada.For our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. As shown on Page 26, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are slightly higher than the fourth quarter averages.Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. We expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes in the first quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower for most products as previously determined price adjustments take effect in certain markets. Raw material costs are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by an increase in commodity realizations and higher sales volumes.I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 25. Our full year 2023 interest expense was $280 million. For full year 2024, we expect interest expense will be approximately $275 million. Turning to taxes, our full year 2023 effective tax rate was approximately 12%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 13% and 16% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid $63 million for full year 2023, which was lower than our tax expense excluding special items due to the timing of U.S. and Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2024 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.For pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was $45 million in 2023. For 2024, we expect this expense will be comparable to 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2023 was $20 million. In 2024, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan, and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $20 million.Turning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2023 capital investments totaled $440 million plus $7 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital for 2024 will be comparable at approximately $440 million, which includes: $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $310 million for Wood Products; and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets and touch briefly on our multiyear targets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates for most of the year, the housing market remained resilient in 2023, particularly in the single-family segment. This was supported by a limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the homebuilder's ability to offer mortgage rate buy-downs and other incentives and underpinned by a strong overall demand for housing.Given the tailwinds from last year, along with improving mortgage rates and a more favorable macro environment, our outlook for single-family housing demand in 2024 is more optimistic relative to this time last year. And that aligns with what we are hearing from our homebuilder customers. We are, however, somewhat less optimistic about the multifamily segment in the near term, largely driven by the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily. All in all, we're more positive on the housing setup for 2024 and believe we should see an uptick in demand for our products. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.Turning to repair and remodel. Activity in the fourth quarter remained steady. And barring significant weather disruptions, we expect a similar level of repair and remodel demand in the first quarter. As for 2024, we believe the underlying demand fundamentals are incrementally more positive compared to last year, supported by otherwise prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment, combined with a healthier economy. And based on recent trends, we think activity will be more heavily weighted toward the pro segment versus DIY. Looking beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.Finally, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made notable advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio, we've more than -- we're more than halfway to our $1 billion Timberlands growth target, and we've increased Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 114% since the inception of that business. In terms of our operating performance, we've made progress against all of our OpEx priorities and have captured $77 million of margin improvements over the last 2 years. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses and are #1 in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands. On the ESG front, we're making progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have committed to net zero emissions by 2040.And finally, we continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by more than 5% annually and returning nearly $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders based on our results from 2021 through 2023. We're incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which have made Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, we remain committed to driving continued improvements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our strategic targets by year-end 2025.So in closing, our performance in 2023 reflects solid execution across our businesses. As we enter 2024, we're encouraged by resiliency in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Just start with the outline that you gave, framing the housing outlook for this year was helpful. And when you think about Weyerhaeuser's positioning relative to that, can you talk about the ability to ramp your production across the different product categories? Where do you think you're sort of best able to really capture the benefits of that lift, especially perhaps if some of the R&R activity comes back this year? And then any thoughts on the channel inventories across the different products and how they're positioned going into the spring?"", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure. Well, I'll start with the first question and sort of go product by product. On the lumber side, that's the business where we have the most flexibility to increase production. And I would say just as a baseline, we would expect to see a pretty significant increase in our production levels in 2024 as we've made a lot of capital investments over the last several years that are really starting to come to fruition. But we do have some upside there. Lumber is one of those areas where you can add shifts, you can add some overtime to take advantage of strong markets when those present themselves.OSB, it's a little bit more difficult. Those operations typically run 24/7 already, so there's really not a whole lot of flex on the OSB side. I would say on the EWP side, there's a little bit of flexibility but those typically have an operating posture where you just don't have as much slack in the system. So really, for the most part, it's going to be lumber and, to a large extent, distribution as well is another area where you can take advantage of strong markets.On the inventory and the channel question, I would say lumber inventory right now is still pretty lean across the system. OSB, I would say, is more or less normal for this time of year. Before the weather events, I would say that the South maybe on the OSB side was a little leaner than normal but otherwise mostly balanced across the system. And then on EWP, I'd say it's about normal for this time of year."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the $77 million of OpEx that you have realized in the last 2 years. As you think about 2024, any thoughts on some of the initiatives you'll be focused on, perhaps areas that you are planning to do certain initiatives in? Can you just give us some color on that?"", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure. Well, just a quick note on that $77 million. Given the inflationary backdrop that we've been operating in over the last several years, that's really a remarkable number. And as we think about rolling into 2024, a lot of the initiatives are the same ones we've been working on. It's reliability in the Wood Products business, taking advantage of all of those capital projects and just the operating improvements. It's looking for opportunities to improve recovery, to make sure that you're capturing the full value of the raw materials entering the mill set.We're continuing to work on innovation across the system all throughout Wood Products, and I think that's going to start really delivering some value. On the Timberlands side, it's continuing to look for ways to reduce our log and haul costs, improve how we build roads, really just across the whole system, looking for opportunities to take cost out of the system and improve efficiency and reliability. So it's a lot of the same things that we've been working on for a long time.I think the good news is that OpEx is deeply ingrained in the culture. We have a lot of buy-in all up and down the organization, and we're going to stay really focused. And assuming that we're going to be in an environment this year with inflation where it's back to a more normalized level, I think we'll see an uptick in the OpEx that we deliver this year relative to the last couple."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from George Staphos, Bank of America.', 'George Leon Staphos', ""Congratulations on the year overall. My 2 questions, I wanted to maybe piggyback, it's a good segue from Susan's questions. So certainly, there's been a lot of progress in Wood Products and in lumber, in particular, over the years through black at the bottom. Yet it was interesting that, in fact, lumber did have a bit of a loss here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, at pricing headwinds, you had some seasonality, yet there are some other issues as well in terms of maybe some additional downtime relative to normal. But tell us how you think about maybe the need to go back to black at the bottom and see if there's a need for more significant work, given what you said to Susan's question about the fact there's been more inflation. How should we think about that, Devin?"", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure. Good question. George, candidly, Q4 was a very challenging quarter in the lumber markets. The product pricing, really the key driver when you see prices going back to the lowest levels in several years, combined with log prices really not going down nearly as much, that just creates a very challenging operating environment. I think as we look at black at the bottom, we think about that not just on a quarterly basis but really over a year-long period. And even in what was a more challenging environment last year, we're obviously still profitable in lumber.That all being said, we're never satisfied. And I do think one of the things you'll see in 2024 is we're going to really ramp up the OpEx in really not just in lumber, across Wood Products as we're facing less headwinds from labor inflation, supplies and equipment inflation. Ordinarily, we can more than offset that through our OpEx work. This last year was just a little bit more challenging. So I expect to see more traction on that front.And then the other thing is we've been doing a lot of work around CapEx over the last several years. And I think in '24, you're going to see some of that result. Holden will be up and fully running this year. We've had a number of other capital projects underway that I think you're going to see the benefits of this year. So we feel pretty good about where we are, notwithstanding a difficult Q4. As we look across the industry and the cost curve, I still think we're in pretty good shape there.You've been around lumber for a long time, George. From time to time, you see these moments in time where the pricing dips below what's probably reasonable. It will eventually recover, and we think we're on that path here even just as we head into Q1. But we're never satisfied. We're going to keep pushing. We want to be industry-leading from a cost standpoint, from a production standpoint, from an efficiency standpoint, and we're not going to stop until we're there."", 'George Leon Staphos', ""Appreciate the thoughts on that, Devin. And certainly, we'll look to mark the progress. My other question, again, is on the lumber side, but in this case, EWP and Engineered Product. So can you talk about why you're seeing, I guess, realization as flat to down? I don't want to paraphrase poorly but that was my take on your commentary, looking out into 1Q. I realize it's a regional market, you get sometimes some imbalances. But what's your view on the year relative to supply-demand, your operating stance, and how that will translate overall into commercial realizations?"", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure, George. On the realization side, as we look at the EWP market, unlike OSB and lumber, which price minute to minute, EWP pricing actions typically have a lag. And so as much as anything, Q1, the commentary on realizations is just over the course of 2023, as that market was rebalancing, there were a variety of different price actions in different geographies. And so Q1 is really when those are hitting in full. The EWP market as a whole, I think, is still pretty solid. Pricing overall, if you look back on a historical basis, is still very strong.As we look into '24, we're getting some pretty strong optimistic signals from our builder customers. And so we're expecting steady demand. Pricing is always just a reflection in each individual market of what the supply-demand dynamic looks like. But in a stronger housing environment, with what we expect to be mortgage rates continuing to come down, we think the setup for EWP is good. And to the extent that, that market really develops and picks up, we'll be in good shape from an EWP standpoint."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.', 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""Looking at the market for Timberlands, when you look back at 2023, can you talk about maybe what kind of price appreciation trends you saw in the market maybe on average for good quality Southern Timberlands and the volume of transactions that you saw? And then as we start out the year here, any kind of further comments on just how you see the market in terms of availability of timberlands, who you're competing with for some of these transactions? Or has there been any sort of change there?"", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure. Well, when we look back at 2023, I think the year as a whole is pretty typical in terms of transaction volume, somewhere in that $2.5 billion mark. Last year was a little bit more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. We saw more activity as we got towards the end of 2023. In terms of the overall appreciation, you can look back just really over the last several years. It wasn't that long ago where $2,000 an acre for good timberlands in the South was pretty typical.Those values have increased pretty substantially. We've seen examples of really high-quality timberlands in the South going as much as $4,000 an acre, and it's not atypical to see above-average properties going in the high 2s. So we've seen a pretty strong value appreciation in U.S. Southern Timberlands prices. Same thing for the West, I would say, just as an example. As we think about 2024, still very early in the year. There aren't a whole lot of transactions in the market right now. That's not unusual in January. But as we think about the year as a whole, we're expecting a pretty typical year, anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion of transaction value for the year. I would expect those deals to continue to be very competitive. Still seems to be a lot of interest in this asset class.And in terms of who we're going to be competing for deals, it's going to, I'm sure, be the same cast of characters. The TIMOs will be active. The timber REITs, I assume, will be into some of those deals, maybe not quite as much, given some of the announcements from some of our competitors. But I suspect they'll still be having their toe in the water to some extent. But then I think you're also going to continue to see some of these new entrants, some of the alternative entities that are looking for carbon values or others that haven't historically been active.So we're expecting it to continue to be competitive. We'll be very active as we have been over a number of years. We'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the value of our asset but at the same time being disciplined to make sure that we pay the right price for those assets."", 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to Wood Products. In the Pacific Northwest, I think recently, you had a competitor that closed a sawmill in Oregon. And they expressed concerns around potentially restrictive policies on harvests on state forests. And I'm just curious, I mean, does that have any impact on the market or your business maybe not directly but just in terms of availability of contractors, competitive dynamics? I'm just curious if there's any read-through there."", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure. Well, the reference there from that mill closure was with respect to some new regulations in Oregon that came into full implementation on January 1 of this year. And the reality is Oregon was already a very tensioned wood basket and with these new regulations, which I'll say just by the way, these regulations are really just bringing Oregon closer to the regulations in Washington. So it's -- we've done business in Washington for a long time under those regulations, and we'll be just fine under these new regulations.But the reality is it's going to make Oregon somewhat more tensioned than it already was. And so fiber supply will be challenged for certain participants depending on the geography. For Weyerhaeuser, we're in a beneficial position in that we have our own fee timberlands. And so I don't anticipate any issues with fiber availability for our mills. But it may ultimately push the price of logs up in that market as there's less timber supply across the stable manufacturing base."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.', 'Kurt Willem Yinger', ""I just had one question. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of European lumber imports over the second half of the year? And in addition to that, we've heard at least that there's been a growing amount of imported LVL showing up as well. How are you thinking about that potentially impacting the EWP market in '24? And longer term, I guess, the potential that European competitors could try to, I guess, become bigger participants in the domestic market here?"", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Well, with respect to your first question on European lumber, we certainly saw that come down over the back half of 2023. I think that's a reflection of primarily lumber prices and just the all-in cost to get lumber from Europe to the U.S. Relative to the pricing dynamic, it just didn't make a lot of sense. So that certainly came down over the course of '23.On a go-forward basis, as we think about lumber, European lumber coming into the market, a couple of things I would point out. First of all, one of the things that was making that trip a little easier is with all of the salvage activity in Central Europe from the beetle infestation, they were getting very, very cheap logs. That salvage activity is starting to wind down. And certainly, we've seen that in terms of the fewer logs going into China from Europe from salvage. And we've heard anecdotally, a lot of the salvageable -- economically salvageable wood is working through. So there won't be as much cheap fiber to compete in this market.And then over the longer term, given that beetle infestation, the loss of Russian lumber into that market, at some point, the European economy will improve and the domestic demand for European lumber will improve. And I think you'll see more of that lumber staying in that market over the long term.With respect to your question about LVL, I think that anecdotally, I think that's true around the margins. You are seeing more of that coming into the U.S. I still think it's more or less a rounding error at this point. For us, in the market that we participate in on the EWP space, it comes with a heavy service component. And there's a customer service aspect that we're able to provide to our customers that one of the reasons is why Trus Joist is such a respected brand. It's not just the quality but the service component. And I think that will be hard for people that are importing a small amount of LVL to compete with. So it's something we'll watch, but I'm not overly concerned about it at this point."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Matthew McKellar', ""First would be now that you're through monetizing your initial forest carbon credits for the pilot project in Maine, could you maybe share any key lessons learned through undertaking that first project? And talk to how you intend to apply those to the projects you're developing in the U.S. South and elsewhere over the next couple of years."", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Sure. Well, we certainly learned some things going through that project. That's why we called it a pilot project. I think the key things from my standpoint are number one, and we certainly saw this, I think, in the price that we were able to get with these initial carbon credits, quality matters. And so we put in the time upfront to build out the internal team and expertise to do these things right. And I think that will certainly serve us well.These are complicated. And so again, that expertise to be able to navigate the -- both the development but also the interactions with the third-party auditors and the ACR, that process, having people that really know what they're doing serves you well and makes it more efficient. And I think we've learned a number of things that will make that process go much more quickly going forward. I do think there's still an opportunity to build out some of the infrastructure, particularly around third-party auditors for the amount of carbon credits that we expect to be coming to market in the years to come. We're going to need more infrastructure to ensure that, that can be done efficiently.But the good news is as we get through this project, if you bring quality projects to the market, we think there's a lot of demand. And so we're really pleased with where we are. We're building out the pipeline, 2 projects we expect to get approved in the first half. We've got 2 or 3 more in the pipeline. We expect to be monetizing additional credits this year, and those just continue to build. Each project you get layers on top of the prior ones, and you build out a nice revenue stream over time. So I think we're really well positioned and in good shape heading into 2024."", 'Matthew McKellar', ""Great. And maybe next, has there been any change at all in your confidence level or appetite around the target of acquiring that $1 billion in timberlands by 2025? It looks like you included your transaction in the Carolinas and Mississippi with FIA towards that target, but that did come with a net cash inflow. So just wondering if there's any change in your thinking, even at the margin, around being a net acquirer of timberlands with the view that prices should rise over time."", 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""No. We still have a high degree of conviction about the value of timberlands over time and our ability to generate strong returns off of that asset. So just a reminder, that $1 billion was really just a reflection of year-over-year through our programmatic M&A activities, we think we will, on average, bring in about $250 million of acquisitions. So there's no magic to that $1 billion. We're going to continue to buy timberlands today, tomorrow, years from now. That's just our core business.We're also always going to be optimizing. And so from time to time, you'll see us trim the portfolio here and there. I think this FIA transaction was a great example of that. We picked up some really strong mature timber that's going to generate nice cash flow close to our other operations, close to our mills, opportunities to create synergies there, and divested some land, which was fine land. It was just -- it was a little bit more scattered in upstate South Carolina, wasn't near other operations, so just weren't able to provide some of the synergies that we can provide in other places.So those kinds of transactions will happen from time to time. It's pretty unique to be able to do those buy-sell transactions concurrently. When you find those opportunities, we're certainly happy to entertain those. But on balance, we still expect to be a net acquirer over time because we think the value of timberlands is going up, and we think we do a good job running them and continue to generate returns."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities.', 'Michael Andrew Roxland', 'Congrats on the year. Just one quick question on EWP. I just want to get some color on order files and how extended they may be into 1Q, particularly as you mentioned, Devin, that those builders are actively seeking products ahead of the spring construction season. So where do order files stand at present? And can you comment on where your EWP operating rate was in 4Q? I think you called out a high 70s rate in 3Q.', 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Yes. So you're a little fuzzy there. I think you're asking about order files. Across the different product lines, order files are pretty much in the normal range across lumber and OSB for this time of year. EWP, we have brought those down to a more normalized level last year. I think as we started off 2023, we were expecting a softer single-family housing market, and so we had dialed back production. It took us a good part of the year to get caught back up. Our order files extended out quite a bit for much of 2023.But heading into '24, I think we're in a better position, which will be, I think, appreciated by our customers. As we look at operating rates in Q4 for EWP, we were in the low 80s in terms of operating rates for EWP and we'll be up somewhat as we look to Q1 2024."", 'Michael Andrew Roxland', 'Appreciate that. And so then for the order files, I mean, how far do they extend in 1Q thus far? Is it to February, March? I mean, how many weeks out do they extend, particularly given the fact -- given your comment around the strong interest from the builders.', 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Yes. I mean, it's product dependent but it can range anywhere from 3 weeks to 5 weeks is pretty much in that normal range, and that's kind of where we're sitting right now."", 'Michael Andrew Roxland', 'Perfect. And then just one quick question on Timberland, especially on pulpwood. I want to get your thoughts around the mill closures, line closures that happened in terms of the number of containerboard mills that closed, the number of pulp lines have been taken offline permanently. You have Enviva going through a restructuring. So would love to get your thoughts on pulpwood demand, obviously plus [valuable inflection], but nevertheless, it helps with -- a shorter rotation helps with near-term cash flow. So how do you think about rotations, harvest planning and the like, given the changing end market dynamics?', 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Yes, that's a great question. We've seen over the last several years, generally speaking, the pulpwood market has been somewhat in decline. We've seen a lot of mill closures over the years, as you say. Just even recently, we've had a handful of either full mill closures or line closures. And that's created some challenge, broadly speaking, in the pulpwood market. I would say for us, because of our scale, we generally have pretty strong relationships with the big consumers of pulpwood. That's true across the pulp and paper manufacturers. That's true across the pellet manufacturers.And so as a general matter, we're typically able to move our volume. But obviously, the pricing dynamic is impacted with less demand overall, so it's something that we're certainly watching. As we think about silviculture, one of the fundamental tenets of how we think about that over the long term is to make sure that we have optionality out into the future. And so as we think about how many trees per acre, our thinning regimes, all of those things, they contemplate a future where we either need more or less grade fiber, et cetera. So we try to preserve as much flexibility out into the future as we can.All of that being said, I would note on the pulpwood market, we're continuing to look -- we, Weyerhaeuser, are continuing to look for opportunities to move that volume. We're having conversations with parties in Asia about potential either pellet or pulpwood-type opportunities for export. I think there may, in the not-too-distant future, be opportunities for biofuels, sustainable aviation fuels that could tension up some of those markets as well. And so our business development team is very focused on that. And we'll make sure that we, Weyerhaeuser, are able to move our pulpwood volume over time."", 'Operator', 'Our final question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Ketan Mamtora', 'Devin or Davie, can you talk a little bit about maybe just a couple of key projects that you have in Wood Products from a CapEx standpoint?', 'Devin W. Stockfish', ""Yes. I mean, so I'll start with Holden. That's our latest mill rebuild brownfield project. That's coming along nicely. We started up the planer mill in Q4. We're ramping up production. We feel very good about that project. The beauty about Holden is it's going to be a phenomenal world-class mill that's completely surrounded by our fee timberlands. So a lot of synergies there, and we're excited to see that fully ramp up this year.Beyond that, our program is really just -- it's projects that we've already done in other places. So it's nothing super sexy. It's adding CDKs, it's adding new merchandisers, trim store stackers, gang saws. Really, the way that program is developed is every mill has a 5-year road map on how to get from where we are today to world-class. And each individual mill may have different things that are bottlenecks that they need to fix and solve to get to that point. So it's nothing really remarkable. It's just continuing to do what we have been doing, executing well and making sure we do those projects on time, on budget. And that's really the essence of our capital plan and has been, for the most part, for a number of years."", 'Ketan Mamtora', ""Understood. That's helpful. And then just one more question around capital allocation, Devin. As you sort of look to 2024 and beyond, I mean, it's been for a couple of years that you are on this sort of the new approach to capital allocation. Any sort of update around how you guys are thinking about supplemental dividend versus share repurchases? And sort of as you look at the different options, sort of how do you think about one over the other?"", 'David M. Wold', ""Sure. You bet, Ketan. I think we really have looked at that consistently over the last few years, and I really don't see that changing substantially as we move forward. I would just say we're in a very fortunate position. We have a lot of levers, so that includes M&A, investing in the business, paying down debt, base variable dividend payments, among others. We're constantly evaluating those views on capital allocation, but those factors are dynamic so it's something we always need to be watching.To your point, our capital allocation framework starts with that commitment to return 75% to 80% of our adjusted FAD back to shareholders via the base, the supplemental. And we do have the flexibility with our framework to use share repurchase as we've done over the last few years. So that portion is really earmarked for returning cash back to shareholders. And with the remaining adjusted FAD, we can allocate that across other opportunities.So as we move forward, I would expect we're likely going to be allocating most of that amount that we have on our balance sheet here in the near term to timberland acquisitions as part of our previously announced plan to purchase $1 billion of timberlands over the next few years. But that said, we do have the flexibility within our capital allocation approach to deploy those cash across the options when we see an opportunity to create value for shareholders."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments.', 'Devin W. Stockfish', 'Terrific. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference.

Founded in 1965, Progressive is a leading independent agency writer of private passenger auto coverage, and the market share leader for the motorcycle products since 1998. Progressive operates through three business segments.', 'The Personal Lines (77% of 2022 Net Premium earned) segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted toward a specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. Personal Lines products comprise insurance for personal autos and special lines products. The agency business includes business written by Progressive’s network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as brokerages in New York and California and strategic alliance business relationships (other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies). The direct business includes business written directly by the company online and over the phone.', 'The Commercial Lines (18%) segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses. The majority of its Commercial Auto customers insure two or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Lines business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the business auto and specialty truck markets. The business auto market accounts for one third of its total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 60% of the vehicles Progressive insures in this business. The remainder is in the specialty truck commercial auto market, which includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage and other short-haul commercial vehicles.', 'The Property (5%) segment writes personal property insurance, for homeowners, other property owners, and renters, in the Agency channel in over 31 states and the District of Columbia for personal property insurance and in over four states for commercial property insurance.', 'Bottom Line', ""Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Progressive, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today."", 'A $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $7,177.82, or a gain of 617.78%, as of January 26, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.', ""Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 173.37% and gold's return of 57.01% over the same time frame."", 'Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PGR.', ""Shares of Progressive have outperformed the industry over the past year. It continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy. However, exposure to catastrophe losses induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses due to higher losses and settlement expenses remain an overhang on the margin. High debt level along with low times earned interest pose financial risk."", 'The stock has jumped 12.42% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$23b and statutory earnings per share of US$9.25 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Sherwin-Williams is executing in line with expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Sherwin-Williams after the latest results."", ' See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Sherwin-Williams from 27 analysts is for revenues of US$23.7b in 2024. If met, it would imply a modest 2.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 13% to US$10.56. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$23.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$10.52 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$314. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Sherwin-Williams at US$360 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$214. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Sherwin-Williams shareholders."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Sherwin-Williams' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 2.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 6.5% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.2% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Sherwin-Williams."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Sherwin-Williams' revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

The utility sector typically encompasses electric power, natural gas, water, and wastewater services. In 2023, the utility sector emerged as the weakest industry within the market. The S&P 500 Utilities index, a benchmark representing the performance of utility stocks, incurred a loss of approximately 10.6% over the course of the year. This contrasts starkly with the broader market sentiment reflected in the S&P 500, which recorded a substantial gain of 19.7% during the same period."", ""A recent Time report attributed the decline in the utility sector to the impact of climate change. This underscores a crucial reminder for investors that climate change is poised to challenge conventional notions about risk and return. Various industries, including agriculture, energy, and insurance, are confronting significant risks linked to climate change. Importantly, this doesn't imply that these sectors will become unsuitable for investment. On the contrary, companies within these industries are likely to necessitate capital to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change."", ""While utility stocks underperformed last year, a historical examination reveals that this has not been a consistent trend. According to Morningstar, utility stocks have demonstrated a robust performance, yielding an annual return of 11% since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. This figure is noteworthy as it nearly aligns with the total return of the entire U.S. market, inclusive of dividends. In 2022, utilities exhibited a remarkable outperformance, surpassing the broader market by an impressive margin of 21 percentage points. This marked the sector's most notable relative performance since the year 2000."", 'Despite their poor performance in 2023, there is a positive aspect for investors seeking to invest in these companies that pay dividends. According to analysts at Morningstar, a significant number of them are currently undervalued. This suggests that there may be opportunities for investors to find stocks in this category that are trading below their perceived intrinsic value, potentially offering a favorable entry point for those looking to allocate funds. The Morningstar report also mentioned that the sector presents an appealing income potential. The median dividend yield stands at 3.7%, marking its highest point since 2013. This figure is consistent with the 20-year average, indicating that the sector is currently providing income opportunities in line with historical trends.', ""The downturn witnessed in the utility sector throughout 2023 is not merely a result of isolated factors but is rather indicative of the sector's broader objectives and challenges. According to a report from Deloitte, in the same year, the power and utilities industry in the US elevated its commitment to decarbonization significantly. This commitment was demonstrated through the deployment of unprecedented volumes of solar power and energy storage, aimed at enhancing both grid reliability and flexibility.

The healthcare giant is worth more than $200 billion, pays a dividend that yields 2.2%, and has a robust portfolio of products. But over the past 12 months, the stock hasn't been a big winner."", 'For opportunistic investors, now may be an optimal time to load up on this big drugmaker. The stock trades at a relatively modest 16 times its estimated future profits. Investors are getting a great bang for their buck at that price.', ""AstraZeneca reported revenue of $33.8 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Its growth rate may look puny at just 2%. However, when factoring out COVID-19 revenue and exchange rates, the company's sales actually increased 15% year over year. AstraZeneca also has multiple segments that have generated double-digit growth at constant exchange rates, including oncology (up 20%); cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism (up 18%); and rare diseases (up 12%)."", ""The company's broad mix of segments and products makes AstraZeneca an ideal stock to hang on to for the long haul because it can pursue many different growth opportunities.

Its performance over the past few decades generally beats the market handily. Of course, that's no guarantee of future success, but Regeneron's history points to a solid underlying business and strong innovative capabilities in developing new medicines. Those qualities should allow the company to continue rewarding its shareholders for a long time."", ""In the mid-term, the biotech will count on its two key growth drivers, eczema treatment Dupixent and Eylea, which treats an eye disease. Though Eylea's patent protection runs out somewhere between 2025 and 2028, Regeneron earned approval for a high-dose formulation of the medicine last year that should be safe from this threat, at least for a while. Beyond that, the company still has a potentially rich and exciting pipeline that should yield key approvals and eventually replace its current crown jewels."", ""Regeneron's late-stage pipeline features 11 programs, including some brand-new ones. Elsewhere, the biotech is dipping its toes in the highly promising gene-editing field through a collaboration with an expert in this area, Intellia Therapeutics. Regeneron is going after many challenging targets with almost four dozen clinical programs in its pipeline. New approvals for key products are likely before Eylea and Dupixent lose their impact on Regeneron's revenue growth."", 'Even more regulatory approvals could be on the way.

Vertex and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, recently won U.S. and U.K. approvals for Casgevy in treating (and effectively curing) rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.', ""Another new non-CF drug could also be on the way soon. Vertex expects to announce late-stage results for VX-548 in treating acute pain in early 2024. Previous clinical data for the drug looked highly promising. Because VX-548 doesn't have the side effects and addictive characteristics of opioid drugs, it could be a huge commercial success story for Vertex."", ""I think Vertex could have another CF-like opportunity with inaxaplin. The drug is currently being evaluated in a pivotal study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD), which affects more patients globally than CF. There aren't any therapies approved for treating the underlying cause of AMKD; inaxaplin could become the first if all goes well."", ""My hunch is that you've already been convinced that Vertex has a bright future.

In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$25.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$11.39 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", 'There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$251, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Union Pacific, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$290 and the most bearish at US$200 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Union Pacific shareholders.', ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 3.1% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 2.9% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry (in aggregate), which analyst estimates suggest will see revenues grow 7.4% annually. So although Union Pacific is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's forecast to grow slower than the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Union Pacific's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$251, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

(NYSE:AMP) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 25, 2024', 'Ameriprise Financial, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin."", ""Alicia Charity: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into company operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website. Some statements that we make on the call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance."", ""These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings release, our 2022 annual report to shareholders and our 2022 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you see adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations, and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis."", ""Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim."", ""James Cracchiolo: Good morning, everyone. I hope that 2024 started off well for each of you. As you saw in our earnings release, Ameriprise delivered a strong fourth quarter to complete an excellent year. I'm proud of our team and what we've accomplished. We've navigated the environmental uncertainty well, supported our clients, and further demonstrated the strength of our value propositions. Regarding the operating environment. What was more positive to end 2023 and start the new year, we know there are questions regarding the continuation of economic growth, inflation and the timing of interest rate reductions. Of course, markets are unpredictable. However, at Ameriprise, our expertise is preparing both our clients and the business to be successful even in an uncertain climate."", ""Now with that backdrop, let's move to our results. For the quarter, revenue growth continued to be robust, up 8%, reflecting good organic growth and positive markets. We again generated strong earnings growth with EPS up 10% or 14% normalized for the items referenced in our press release. And our nearly 50% ROE is consistently among the best in the industry. We also delivered excellent full year adjusted operating results. Excluding unlocking and the items we referenced, revenue was $15.4 billion, up 8%. Earnings increased 18% to $3.3 billion. And our EPS was $30.46, up another 24%. In fact, these are record results for Ameriprise, and assets under management and administration were near an all-time high at $1.4 trillion. Across the firm, we're very well positioned to help investors with our compelling client experience and complement the businesses, capabilities and talented team."", 'With regard to some business highlights. Wealth Management delivered another strong quarter. Our efforts are centered on engaging more people in our advice-based client experience, which helps our clients achieve more of their goals and creates higher satisfaction, net flows and productivity growth. Client acquisition was up nicely in the quarter, especially in the $500,000 to $5 million client segment. Total client assets increased to a new record of $901 billion, up 19%, and client flows were approximately $23 billion. Total transactional activity picked up a bit in the quarter. However, given the environment, clients continued to maintain higher cash levels with assets and cash products growing to about $82 billion. Over time, we expect these assets will be further deployed as clients return to the markets more fully.', 'Year after year, our adviser productivity growth is consistently among the best in the industry. In fact, it increased another 11% to a new high of $916,000 per adviser in the quarter. Our field force is highly engaged, and they value the Ameriprise culture. As to the experienced advisers we recruit. In the quarter, we brought on board 166 productive advisers, which includes the Comerica advisers who joined us. Recruits tell us that associating with Ameriprise has given them a strong client value proposition integrated technology and the leadership support they need to provide first-class service to their clients and grow their practices. Our bank continues to provide benefits and grow nicely. Bank and certificate assets increased 28% to $37 billion.', ""We see good opportunity here to further deepen client relationships and bring in more of our client assets that they hold at other banking institutions. As you can see, our consistent focus and investment in the business is driving strong results. And we're not standing still. We continue to invest significantly to drive further efficiency and organic growth. Advisers using our integrated e-meeting capability, customer relationship platform and online adviser dashboards find that these tools enhance their ability to deliver for clients and manage their practices, as well as identify growth opportunities. We're also leveraging advanced analytics and accelerating enhancements to our mobile and digital experiences on our public and secure sites to engage more clients and prospects."", ""I'd also highlight that Ameriprise brand awareness is strong and steady, and our growth opportunity continues to be significant. Clients and prospects across segments need meaningful contact and advice more than ever, and that's where we're concentrating. Earlier this month, I met with our field leaders to kick off the year. They are highly engaged and energized about our position and ability to build on our success in 2024. Next, in Retirement & Protection, we're driving good sales. These solutions help serve our clients' comprehensive needs and the business is consistently a strong earnings contributor. The team is focused on providing a best-in-class experience with an ease of doing business and it's resulting in better sales. Total variable annuity sales were up 15%, with good sales in our structured product."", ""Protection sales were up 6%, driven by our higher-margin product. In addition, we just introduced new enhancements to our core product lines to help further serve our clients' evolving protection and income needs. Moving to Asset Management. We continue to serve clients in an evolving market. Assets under management grew nicely in the fourth quarter, up 9% to $637 billion driven by market appreciation and positive foreign exchange. In terms of some color on flows. Our U.S. retail mutual fund outflows were in line with the industry. Though they remained pressured, we had a bit of a pickup in gross sales and redemptions have slowed from a year ago. U.K. retail remained soft, and we're seeing some improvements in Europe. For global institutional, our outflows were elevated as we expected due to the actions we set to realign resources, including portfolio management changes."", ""Our product capabilities are extensive and the team is concentrating on regaining sales momentum. Performance is critical to that, and we're delivering consistent competitive investment performance that reflects our research expertise. Our 3, 5 and 10-year numbers are very strong, and we saw a nice pickup in the 1-year fixed income numbers. And I highlight that we continue to have 113 4- and 5-star Morningstar rated funds in our lineup. Like other active managers, we're managing industry pressure and doing a great deal to refine our operating processes while reducing expenses globally. We're enhancing our efficiency and effectiveness while making good investments, including in data and analytics. We're focused on leveraging our performance as well as our global distribution and servicing capabilities."", 'So for Ameriprise, it was another great year and a continuation of our significant growth over many years. In addition, we built on our record of strong financial performance, including generating one of the best ROEs in the industry. And with that, we consistently demonstrate our ability to return to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, Ameriprise returned another $587 million, and for the full year, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, we returned a substantial amount to shareholders that resulted in a share count reduction of 25%. As I look at Ameriprise, we continue to be well positioned. The strong performance we achieved is underscored by the industry accolades Ameriprise consistently earns. Over the course of the year, this is the type of recognition we received.', ""4.9 out of 5 stars in client satisfaction from our clients. Our employee and adviser engagement ranks among the best across all industries. We have one of the highest customer trust scores in financial services. J.D. Power has awarded us for outstanding customer service experience for our adviser phone support 5 years in a row. Ameriprise is the winner in the Wealth Management category from Kiplinger. In addition, we've been recognized as a military-friendly employer in 9 years in a row and as a best place to work for disability inclusion. Finally, Ameriprise is among the Best Managed Companies of 2023 on the Wall Street Journal Management Top 250 list. For the firm overall, as we enter 130 year in the business, our foundation and business are strong."", ""I'm immensely proud of our people, and we have a great opportunity to continue our success together in 2024. Now I'll turn things over to Walter, and then we'll take your questions."", ""Walter Berman: Thank you, Jim. As Jim said, strong results this quarter continue to demonstrate the leverage of our diversified business model across market cycles. Underlying EPS grew 14% to $7.75 after adjusting for items in the quarter that we called out in the release. These included $0.28 of expense related to a regulatory accrual, $0.14 from severance expense, and elevated mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation expense of $0.13 resulting from Ameriprise's substantial share price appreciation. You would not have been aware of these items and their associated magnitude. Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, up 15%, benefiting from $36 billion of client flows in 2023 and market appreciation."", ""Across the firm, we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment. G&A increased only 2% normalized to the items I noted. We continue to take a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses across the firm to manage margins given the uncertainty in the macro environment as evidenced by the $26 million of severance recognized in the third and fourth quarters. At the same time, we continue to make investments to drive business growth, particularly in Wealth Management. As we move into 2024, we will continue the same discipline and we'll maintain a flat expense base for the year at a minimum. Our consolidated margin was 26.4% excluding the items I noted. And we have a best-in-class return on equity of 48.5%."", ""The balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our excess capital and liquidity positions remain strong and we've seen a significant $1.8 billion reduction in the net unrealized loss position to only $1.5 billion. Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable 90% free cash flow contributions across all business segments. This allowed us to return $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the year, a continuation of our differentiated track record. Lastly, I mentioned that Ameriprise successfully expanded its presence in the financial institutions channel. The closing on our partnership with Comerica Bank in November that added an initial $15 billion of client flows. Given the timing of the conversion, there was limited financial benefit in the quarter."", ""On Slide 6, you'll see our strong results in 2023 were driven by business momentum across key measures. Assets grew 15%, with revenues up 8%. Pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 10%. And the pretax adjusted operating margin was 26.4%. The diversified nature of our businesses strengthens our model and drives our consistent performance. It is this balance that enables Ameriprise to consistently drive shareholder value across market cycles. The key growth driver of Ameriprise is the Wealth Management business, as you can see on Slide 7. Wealth Management client assets increased 19% year-over-year to $901 billion, driven by strong organic growth and client flows, along with higher equity markets. We had $53 billion of net inflows over the past year, with $23 billion coming in the quarter from new clients joining the firm, the deepening of existing relationships and adding experienced advisers."", 'Revenue per adviser reached $916,000 in the quarter, up 11% from the prior year, from higher spread revenue, enhanced productivity and business growth. On Slide 8, you can see how the business performance drove strong financial results for Wealth Management. In the quarter, adjusted operating net revenues increased 8% to $2.4 billion from growth in client assets in both wrap and brokerage accounts and improved transactional activity. This included about $15 billion of initial flows related to Comerica partnership, in addition to the $8 billion of underlying client flows. While markets were favorable in the quarter, we did not realize the full benefit of the market appreciation in the quarter given our beginning-of-month billing practice. We are starting the year with the wind at our backs with the significant market appreciation to end the year.', 'Total cash balance, including third-party money market funds and brokered CDs reached a new high this quarter at $81.5 billion. We have seen stability in our underlying client cash positions with free cash up 4% sequentially. This stabilization has continued into January. Additionally, we continue to see new money flowing into money market funds and brokered CDs as well as into our certificates. This creates a significant redeployment opportunities as markets normalize for clients to put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform over time. The financial benefits from cash remain significant and will be a sustainable source of earnings going forward. Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 9%, with distribution expense up 10%, reflecting higher asset balances.', 'Excluding the regulatory accrual, G&A declined 1% in the quarter and was up only 4% for the full year. We will continue to invest in this growing business while maintaining this expense discipline in 2024. In total, the underlying margin expanded 40 basis points to 30.3%, reflecting our revenue growth combined with expense discipline. This level is consistent with our margin for the full year. Turning to Asset Management on Slide 9. Financial results were very strong in the quarter, and we are managing the business well through a challenging environment for active asset managers. Total AUM increased 9% to $637 billion, primarily from higher equity markets and foreign exchange translation, partially offset by net outflows. Like other active managers, we experienced pressure retail flows from global market volatility and a risk-off investor sentiment.', 'In addition, we had $3 billion of institutional outflows that included $2 billion of expected breakage from portfolio management changes made as part of our reengineering initiatives. Investment performance is another critical area of focus and long-term 3-, 5- and 10-year investment performance remains strong. We also had notable improvements in 1-year fixed income performance in the quarter from strength in mortgage opportunities, tax exempt and strategic municipal income strategies. In the quarter, operating earnings increased $194 million as a result of equity market appreciation, disciplined expense management and higher performance fees which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows. Performance fees are an important part of our business and reflect excellent performance in our hedge fund and other institutional accounts, but the recognition of performance fees is uneven throughout the year.', ""While we had $30 million in performance fees in both 2023 and '22, the fourth quarter this year included $21 million in performance fees and the fourth quarter of 2022 only included $5 million. We are finalizing the integration of BMO and are looking globally at areas where we can enhance operational efficiency and manage expenses so we are well positioned going forward. G&A was down 4% excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation and performance fee compensation. And the margin was in our target range of 32% in the quarter. Looking ahead, as Jim said, we will continue to take further expense action in 2024 given the environment to preserve margin in our target range. Let's turn to Slide 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation, reflecting the high quality of the business that has been built over a long period of time."", 'Pretax adjusted operating earnings in the quarter increased 2% to $202 million, reflecting higher investment yields. Overall, Retirement & Protection Solutions sales improved in the quarter, with protection sales up 6% to $72 million, primarily in higher-margin products. Variable annuity sales grew 15% to $1.1 billion, with the majority of sales in structured variable annuities. Turning to Slide 11. Ameriprise delivered excellent growth in 2023 and has done the same over the longer term and through changing market cycles, reflecting our focus on profitable growth. In 2023, revenues grew 8% from higher interest earnings, higher equity markets and solid client net inflows. Earnings per share increased 21% from last year from revenue trends, well-managed expenses and differentiated capital return.', ""And ROE increased 290 basis points to nearly 49%. Over the past 5 years, we have generated 6% revenue and 15% EPS compounded annual growth and 1,170 basis points of improvement in ROE. This is differentiated performance across multiple cycles compared to our peers and speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix and the growth of our Wealth Management business. Turning to Slide 12. You can see Wealth Management was a significant contributor to Ameriprise's successful performance, driving 2/3 of the company's operating earnings. Our advisers are becoming more productive with the support of our advice model, with revenue per adviser of $916,000 in the year, up 8% on an annualized basis from 2018. And we are growing profitably with 16% growth in pretax earnings since 2018."", ""And over that time frame, our Wealth Management margin has expanded 840 basis points to nearly 31%, putting at industry-leading levels. Now let's finish with the balance sheet on Slide 13. Our solid balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation have supported our ability to execute a consistent capital return strategy, while continuing to invest for growth. In 2023, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders, with $587 million in the fourth quarter. But over the past 5 years, we returned $12 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. This included the repurchase of 41 million shares at an average price of $215, resulting in a net reduction in our share count of 25%. Looking ahead, capital management will continue to be a point of differentiation for Ameriprise."", 'With that, we will take your questions.', 'See also 15 Highest Quality Boot Brands in the US and 19 Best Reusable Water Bottles on Amazon Under $50.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Ahead of International Data Privacy Day, the findings highlight the growing Privacy concerns with GenAI, trust challenges facing organizations over their use of AI, and the attractive returns from privacy investment. Drawing on responses from 2,600 privacy and security professionals across 12 geographies, the seventh edition of the Benchmark shows that privacy is much more than a regulatory compliance matter.', 'Growing Privacy Concerns with Generative AI', '""Organizations see GenAI as a fundamentally different technology with novel challenges to consider,"" said Dev Stahlkopf, Cisco Chief Legal Officer. ""More than 90% of respondents believe GenAI requires new techniques to manage data and risk. This is where thoughtful governance comes into play. Preserving customer trust depends on it.""', ""Among the top concerns, businesses cited the threats to an organization's legal and Intellectual Property rights (69%), and the risk of disclosure of information to the public or competitors (68%)."", 'Most organizations are aware of these risks and are putting in place controls to limit exposure: 63% have established limitations on what data can be entered, 61% have limits on which GenAI tools can be used by employees, and 27% said their organization had banned GenAI applications altogether for the time being. Nonetheless, many individuals have entered information that could be problematic, including employee information (45%) or non-public information about the company (48%).', 'Slow Progress on AI and Transparency', ""Consumers are concerned about AI use involving their data today, and yet 91% of organizations recognize they need to do more to reassure their customers that their data is being used only for intended and legitimate purposes in AI. This is similar to last year's levels, suggesting that not much progress has been achieved."", ""Organizations' priorities to build consumer trust differ from those of individuals. Consumers identified their top priorities as getting clear information on exactly how their data is being used, and not having their data sold for marketing purposes. When asked the same question, businesses identified their top priorities as complying with privacy laws (25%) and avoiding data breaches (23%). It suggests additional attention on transparency would be helpful — especially with AI applications where it may be difficult to understand how the algorithms make their decisions."", 'Privacy and Trust: the Role of External Certifications and Laws', ""Organizations recognize the need to reassure their customers about how their data is being used, and 98% said that external privacy certifications are an important factor in their buying decisions. This is the highest we've seen over the years."", '""94% of respondents said their customers would not buy from them if they did not adequately protect data,"" explains Harvey Jang, Cisco Vice President and Chief Privacy Officer. ""They are looking for hard evidence the organization can be trusted. Privacy has become inextricably tied to customer trust and loyalty. This is even more true in the era of AI, where investing in privacy better positions organizations to leverage AI ethically and responsibly.""', 'Despite the costs and requirements privacy laws may impose on organizations, 80% of respondents said privacy laws have had a positive impact on them, and only 6% said the impact has been negative. Strong privacy regulation boosts consumer confidence and trust in the organizations they choose to share their data with.', 'Further, many governments and organizations are putting in place data localization requirements to keep certain data within country or region. Whilst most businesses (91%) believe that their data would be inherently safer if stored within their country or region, 86% also said that a global provider, operating at scale, can better protect their data compared to a local provider.', 'Privacy: a Valuable Investment', 'Over the past five years, privacy spending has more than doubled, benefits have trended up, and returns have remained strong. This year, 95% indicated that privacy\'s benefits exceed its costs, and the average organization reports getting privacy benefits of 1.6 times their spending. Further, 80% indicated getting significant ""Loyalty and Trust"" benefits from their privacy investments, and this is even higher (92%) for the most privacy-mature organizations.', 'In 2023, largest organizations (10,000+ employees) increased their privacy spending by seven to eight percent since last year. However, smaller organizations saw lower investment, for example, businesses with 50-249 employees decreased their privacy investment by a fourth on average.', 'Additional Resources', 'Cisco 2024 Data Privacy Benchmark Study', 'Infographic', 'Cisco Security Blog', 'About Cisco', 'Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.
