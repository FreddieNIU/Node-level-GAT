The integration with FilingRamp gives Mozart users an end-to-end forms solution, where they can easily analyze, develop and submit updated forms to regulators in a single workflow.How it worksMozart can help insurers create and manage policy forms and endorsements across the entire product life cycle, helping to create significant workflow efficiencies and cost savings. Its advanced machine learning algorithms analyze an insurer’s forms for words and even concepts to help ensure their coverage language remains consistent across their portfolio. With a complete audit trail and workflow tools, insurers can work smarter while mitigating compliance risks.Streamlining the filing processThanks to a new integration with FilingRamp, Mozart users can now file new and revised forms to state regulators through the System for Electronic Rates &amp; Forms Filing (SERFF), the filing system managed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The integration enables Mozart users to centralize their forms management workflow and streamline what’s typically a multi-step process of manually interacting with SERFF to track filings and respond to regulator questions. FilingRamp features full two-way API integration with SERFF, helping to automate form submissions.“We believe that the forms submission process needed to be modernized,” said Jeremy Battles, FilingRamp CEO. “FilingRamp and Mozart together allow insurers to submit filings with improved speed, shaving valuable time from the process. Faster submissions can lead to faster approvals, which helps insurers reduce paperwork and sell products more quickly.”Story continues“By leveraging the advanced workflow, forms management and authoring tools within Mozart, insurers have been able to launch products faster while maintaining high levels of quality control and policy language consistency across their forms portfolio,” said Ron Beiderman, Senior Vice President of Commercial Lines Underwriting at Verisk. “The integration of Mozart and FilingRamp builds on this success by making it even easier for insurers to submit forms to regulators, creating powerful efficiencies that free them to focus on more strategic initiatives.”To learn more about Mozart, visit verisk.com/mozart/.

Per ETFGI, total assets in ETFs and ETPs listed globally reached $8.87 trillion at the end of October. This is especially due to their unique strategies, creativity, transparency, diversification benefits, enhanced tax competencies, low turnover and, of course, low cost.While there are several types of cost associated with ETFs, like trading commissions, bid/ask spreads, premiums and discounts, and tracking error, expense ratios have been the biggest crowd pullers in the ETF world. In fact, the price war has been an ongoing theme in the ETF space over the past few years. It is now in high gear, with most of the ETFs having an expense ratio of zero or below zero. This is especially true as ETFs with low expense ratios significantly outperform their expensive counterparts when other factors remain constant. This can be explained by the following example (see: all the ETFs with Low Expense Ratios here).Consider two funds with expense ratios of 0.10% and 0.50% and invest $10,000 in both. Now, both funds have delivered the same annual returns of 10% in 10 years. The fund with an expense ratio of 0.10% will grow to $25,703 in 10 years while the same fund with 0.50% in expense ratio will grow by a lower amount of $24,782 in the same time frame. Further, the difference in total returns (after expenses) becomes more significant if we increase the holding period. The same funds with an expense ratio of 0.10% and 0.50%, when invested for 30 years, would have a value of $169,797 and $152,203, respectively, after 30 years.Keeping the importance of expense ratio in mind, we have highlighted the 25 cheapest ETFs currently on the market and have AUM of more than $50 million:BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF BKLC – Expense ratio: 0.00%BNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF provides investors with broad exposure to large-capitalization stocks and follows the Morningstar U.S. Large Cap Index.

The company uses renewable energy to refine low-grade iron ores into high-purity iron through electrochemical and hydrometallurgical processes. This material will be used in the steelmaking process to offset other high-quality metallics that come with higher greenhouse gas emissions.""We are excited to partner with Electra and its revolutionary process to produce emission-free iron,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""Just as Nucor changed the face of the steel industry 53 years ago with our first electric arc furnace, successfully developing and scaling up a zero-carbon iron product is the type of transformative technology that could change the steel industry as we know it.""The process developed by Electra produces Low-Temperature Iron (LTI) from commercial and low-grade ores using zero-carbon intermittent electricity. The company electrochemically refines iron ore into pure iron at 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) using renewable electricity. That iron can be turned into steel using existing electric arc furnaces, which account for 70% of steel production in the U.S.Electra's process results in zero carbon dioxide emissions. By comparison, approximately 70% of the steel produced globally is made with blast furnace technology, an extractive process fed by iron ore, coal, and limestone that emits about two tons of carbon dioxide for every ton of steel produced.Using primarily recycled scrap as raw material, Nucor is already one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world. The circular nature of remelting recycled scrap in electric arc furnaces, combined with steel's ability to be infinitely recycled, means that Nucor's steelmaking facilities generate roughly one-third of the carbon dioxide of extractive steelmaking plants. Its investment in Electra is one of several investments the company is making that furthers Nucor's status as a sustainability leader and builds on the innovation that has already led to cleaner steel production in the United States.Story continues""We are focused on investing our capital on opportunities like these that have the potential to take our company and the entire industry to the next level,"" said Doug Jellison, Nucor's Executive Vice President of Raw Materials, and a member of Electra's Market Advisory Board. ""We will continue to look to the future for new and innovative ways to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals.""About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel -- in bars, beams, sheet and plate; hollow structural section tubing; electrical conduit; steel racking; steel piling; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; precision castings; steel fasteners; metal building systems; insulated metal panels; overhead doors; steel grating; and wire and wire mesh.

This, in turn, boosts the ownership stake of shareholders in the company's shares.Overall, this year had not been a good one for Lincoln National, as cited by the company CEO Ellen Cooper at the abovementioned conference. Headwinds ranging from a statutory charge of $550 million on LNC’s reserves, continued incidence of COVID claims and adverse results within the life insurance business gave a blow to the insurer’s performance.Before 2022, Lincoln National maintained a sound record of generating an annual capital of $2.4 billion. It also resorted to increasing share buyback authorization from time to time. However, due to several challenges this year, management expects LNC to witness a negative capital generation of $1.6 billion in 2022. In absence of prudent capital management, the insurer’s risk-based capital ratio might continue to deteriorate.Bringing in a ray of hope, Lincoln National is undertaking steps to shield itself against adversities inflicted by the cropping up of unforeseeable macro headwinds. These measures include bringing about a change in the business mix, decreasing volatility to capital markets and raising capital in the form of preferred equity. With the financial impetus received through such efforts, LNC aims to repay debts in the third quarter of 2023 and inject strength in the form of contributing 30 points to its risk-based capital ratio.Story continuesThough the CEO remains optimistic about capital generation improving next year, it is still likely to face a headwind and remain below the pre-2022 record. Management believes continued strong sales, new business generation, frequent interest rate hikes and cost-cutting efforts arising from the Spark program can help in restoring a strong financial position. Only then LNC can lift the suspension on share buybacks and continue rewarding more profits to shareholders.  Shares of LNC have lost 35.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 2.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksLincoln National currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the insurance space are Employers Holdings, Inc.

(“BBH”) to terminate the proposed acquisition of BBH’s Investor Services business, State Street STT announced additional share repurchases. The company intends to buy back $500 million worth of shares during the fourth quarter of 2022. This brings the total authorization to $1.5 billion for the quarter.Also, State Street plans to return more than 80% of its earnings next year. The company chairman and CEO, Ron O’Hanley said, “We recognize the priority our shareholders place on capital return, and we continue to expect to use dividends and share repurchases to return significantly more capital than our medium term target payout of 80% of earnings in 2023.”Hence, the investor-friendly decision was cheered by the market participants, and STT’s share price soared 8.2% yesterday. Another reason for the bullish stance is that many banks are doing away with share repurchases and dividend hikes on higher capital requirements and deteriorating economic outlook. One such big name is JPMorgan JPM. The company, in order to meet higher future capital requirements amid macroeconomic woes, temporarily suspended buybacks. Also, JPM kept the quarterly dividend unchanged at $1 per share despite clearing the 2022 stress test in June.State Street paused share repurchases at the time of announcing the transaction to acquire the above-mention business in September 2021. However, the deal faced unprecedented delays. So, on Nov 30, both companies decided to terminate the agreement as it wasn’t “in the best interests of clients, shareholders or employees to continue to invest time and resources in the transaction in this challenging financial services M&amp;A environment.”Further, following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, State Street announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to 63 cents per share in July 2022. Considering the last day’s closing price, STT’s dividend yield currently stands at 3.39%. The yield is attractive for income investors and represents a steady income stream.State Street remains well-poised with respect to fundamental business activities, given the global exposure, higher interest rates and a broad array of innovative products and services (including the launch of State Street Digital and State Street Alpha). These efforts, along with new business servicing wins and inorganic growth strategy, are expected to keep supporting revenues.So far this year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 13.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 20%.

But only 24% of computer scientists are women, compared to 37% in 1994. The biggest drop off in interest in computer science in girls happens when they are ages 13 to 17.The nonprofit Girls Who Code is trying to reverse that trend with a multi-pronged approach aimed at educating, inspiring and equipping girls to explore coding and prepare for a career in tech. U.S. Bank recently marked the fifth anniversary of its cumulative $1 million national investment in the group, which has included sponsoring clubs for students grades 3-12 to explore coding in a fun and friendly environment and also hosting events and field trips with U.S. Bank tech leaders.""We say it all the time: ‘you can't be what you can't see.' Our girls before they are even 10 years old are inundated with these images of what a computer scientist looks like,"" and it doesn't look like them, said Dr. Tarika Barrett, CEO of Girls Who Code, during a recent Real Good podcast interview. ""The culture piece is very real. That's why we have a laser-like focus on teaching girls computer science and building this pipeline.""""The culture piece is very real. That's why we have a laser-like focus on teaching girls computer science and building this pipeline.""- Dr. Tarika Barrett, CEO of Girls Who CodeGirls Who Code has set an ambitious goal of eliminating the gender gap in entry-level tech jobs by 2030. To achieve that, the organization partners with school districts, libraries and afterschool programs across the country to offer free Club programs to spark an early interest in computer science for 3rd-5th an 6th-12th grade students. Some 470,000 students have attended Club programs since 2012. For older students, Girls Who Code offers programs including virtual mentoring and a hiring summit to connect hiring managers to a diverse slate of candidates for internships and jobs.Story continuesComputing skills are highly sought after by employers, which means candidates can command higher salaries and more job mobility. Equally important is the reality that technology ""meets us at every touch stone of our lives"" - from voting to healthcare to security and beyond, Barrett notes, and it is vital to have the perspective of women and underrepresented minorities in those conversations.""Our actions today will have a ripple effect for years to come,"" said Dilip Venkatachari, global chief information and technology officer at U.S. Bank. ""As one of the country's largest employers, we are committed to fostering inclusion in technology and all areas of our company.""In addition to its sponsorship of Girls Who Code, U.S. Bank supports several other initiatives to increase the representation of women in tech, including sponsoring several teams of middle and high school girls participating in the Appapalooza competition by Technovation, investing in a program with the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio to help expand its cybersecurity badge program and donating to nonprofits in the workforce development field including Girls Inc. and Girls with Impact.Learn more about U.S. Bank hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730915/US-Bank-Celebrates-Five-Years-of-Girls-Who-Code-Partnership]"

Harper is based out of Indianapolis and was the Region V honoree, while Moberly, who is based in Kansas City, was the Region VII winner.The Star Among Stars program was established to recognize Region VII VPP participants that post total case incidence rates (TCIR) and days away/restricted/transferred case incidence rates (DART) well below the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) national averages.""Maintaining our employee-partners’ safety and health is a commitment embraced by our entire workforce,"" said Stephen Jenkins, Cintas Director of Safety and Health. ""VPP is central to Cintas’ safety and health journey and we dedicate significant resources to the program. We are committed to pursuing – and then maintaining – VPP Star certifications at our locations, and we believe we’ve established standards and protocols that can help support other companies in their safety and health efforts. That’s one reason we also embrace our employee-partners efforts to participate in OSHA’s SGE program. We believe it’s one of the best ways we can give back and help make workplaces safer for all.Story continues""We’re incredibly proud that our employee-partners have been recognized for their own commitments to VPP. Myron and Meghan do incredible work as SGEs. It’s fantastic that the VPPPA has recognized their dedication and influence in their roles to support safety and health in their regions’ workplaces. And as a location, Kansas City First Aid &amp; Safety has created and maintained a very strong culture of safety. This recognition is a great example of how our location leaders demonstrate a strong commitment to safety and health."" Jenkins added.Cintas’ commitment to OSHA’s VPP has set a new standard for U.S. companies. As of September 2022, a total of 127 Cintas U.S. facilities were VPP Star certified, a total that far outpaces every American company.What is VPPOSHA established VPP to promote effective and cooperative worksite safety and health in both private industry and at federal worksites.Achieving VPP certification is rigorous. Businesses must demonstrate that management and employees work cooperatively – and proactively – to prevent workplace accidents by implementing a comprehensive safety and health management system and maintaining injury and illness rates below national BLS averages for their respective industries.Approval into VPP is OSHA’s official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health. To remain in the program, VPP participants must be re-evaluated every three to five years.What Are SGEs and What Do They Do?OSHA launched the SGE program in 1994 to support the VPP’s on-site evaluations and leverage the expansive experience and knowledge base of safety and health professionals in the private sector. It also allows industry professionals to work alongside government officials and share views and ideas from a workplace perspective.Prospective SGEs must apply to OSHA for consideration for the program, and must also receive the recommendation of their employers to apply. SGEs are selected from a competitive pool of applicants and have to meet specific criteria to be eligible, including employment at a VPP-certified location or by a VPP-approved employer, as well as successfully completing additional continuing education and certifications.SGEs are volunteers and assist OSHA personnel during on-site facility evaluations. They may also conduct SGE training sessions and VPP application workshops, mentor sites that are applying for or recertifying for VPP certification, or present on the VPP or other safety and health topics at regional or national VPPPA conferences and events.According to OSHA, ""The SGE Program encompasses the spirit of VPP – industry, labor, and government cooperation."" This cooperative program ""embodies the idea of continuous improvement, which allows SGEs to bring a unique perspective to the team effort and take back to their sites ideas and best practices to further improve worker protections.""What is the SGE of the Year Award?The SGE of the Year Award was created by the VPPPA and, according to the organization, recognizes an SGE ""who epitomizes and exhibits exceptional support, effort, and action in VPP, and in doing so sets him/herself apart from other SGEs.""Winners must meet three criteria: be actively involved in volunteer activities that benefit the VPP, perform outreach and assistance to employers/employees outside his/her own company, and demonstrate an outstanding commitment to the partnership ideals of VPP.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers’ facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

In other words, the warehouse giant sells merchandise you wouldn't expect to find inside a retail store that promises rock-bottom prices on everyday essentials.For example, Costco sells caskets online. Once you are done buying a casket, you can purchase a vacation and a $329,000-plus 6.5-carat engagement ring.Inside a new Costco store in Lake Stevens, Washington, we found a nearly $2,000 bottle of wine, an inflatable jacuzzi, and, of course, the legendary 93-inch, 48.5-pound stuffed Costco bear.A woman pushes a trolley with a teddy bear at the first Costco outlet in China on the store's opening day in Shanghai on August 27, 2019. (HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP/Getty Images)Costco's longtime CEO Craig Jelinek told Yahoo Finance that selling these products (which do in fact sell, says Jelinek) only enhances the shopping experience for members.""It's just one of those things that powers the brand on exciting items,"" Jelinek said of the giant stuffed bear. ""I got one of these for my grandkids and brought it back from Australia...Where we first brought them in was Australia. I said we need to move this everywhere. The bear has now been around for five or six years.""Naturally, these higher ticket items help to enhance Costco's top and bottom lines.""People like to go shop in stores, it's the thrill of the [treasure] hunt, and that is what people love with Costco,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe explained.Indeed, executing on this treasure hunt experience has supported Costco's growth in 2022 and helped it win the Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award. More on that below.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Costco's 2022 at a GlanceCostco's same-store sales have outperformed conventional competitors: Costco's U.S. same-store sales for the nine weeks that ended October 30 increased by 10%.By comparison, third-quarter same-store sales for discounters Walmart (WMT) U.S. and Target (TGT) rose by a far slower 8.2% and 2.7%, respectively.Story continuesStacked up against its pure-play warehouse rivals, Costco's recent sales growth trends are more in line with competitors. East Coast warehouse club rival BJ's Wholesale (BJ) saw third-quarter same-store sales increase by 9.7% while same-store sales at Walmart's Sam's Club increased by 10% in the third quarter. But given that Costco is much bigger than Sam's, which has sales of about $59 billion, those same-store sales figures are impressive.Costco had a bang-up year within its key operating metrics: For the fiscal year ending Aug. 28, Costco posted a 14.4% overall same-store sales increase, a 93% renewal rate for U.S. members, the addition of 7.3 million members, and a slight increase in net profit margins (a win in the hyperinflationary environment).

However, the company is benefitting from the strength in the adoption of augmented reality (AR) lenses.Snap recently announced its fifth Lens Fest, which is a multi-day global virtual event exploring the new dimensions of AR and celebrating the lens creator community that shapes the future of AR.Snap reports that its AR ecosystem is expanding, with over 300,000 AR creators and developers who have contributed to more than 3 million AR Lenses.It has further collaborated with a small group of creators and developers who are building Lenses with digital goods, including power-ups, AR items, and extra tools within a Lens, which can be unlocked by snapchatters using Snap Tokens. These lenses are expected to be rolled out in a few weeks in specific locations.To keep fueling innovations in AR, Snap has also announced a new Lensathon event, which will challenge creators to push the boundaries of AR and create lenses beyond it for a prize pool of $200K.How is Snap Planning to Disrupt the AR Industry?As fashion and AR technology join hands, Snap takes this opportunity to enhance its AR for the use of shopping.Snap created a range of AR lenses for Vogue World’s New York Fashion Week runway show, wherein attendees could capture looks from designer brands including Dior, Burberry, Christopher John Rogers and Bode, and could then access virtual versions of the designs and try them on using Snap AR technology.Snap also introduced a new digital fashion collaboration with Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M, which allows users to select outfits designed by H&amp;M, strike a pose, and share their favorite digital looks.Snap Inc.

Snap reports more than 250 million snapchatters who have been engaged with AR shopping Lenses since January 2021.Snap joined Walmart’s WMT Walmart Connect in September as an innovation partner, enabling advertisers to buy Snap ad units through Walmart Connect and reach the latter’s large and engaged audience through its video and augmented reality ad formats.These extensive product offerings have deepened the engagement of its global community, which increased 19% year over year to reach 363 million daily active users in third-quarter fiscal 2022.Besides this, Snap has been aggressively focused on developing AR glasses for many years now. Though there isn’t an update on it, the company has had hundreds of developers from 30 countries in the last two years who have experimented with the next generation of Spectacles, building hundreds of lenses right in Lens Studio.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is determined to achieve success with its AR glasses and though this looks a little far-fetched right now, it will be a remarkable and growth-driven achievement for the company once accomplished.Story continues You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Snap To Face Competition in The AR IndustryPer GlobeNewswire, Augmented Reality (AR) Market Size is expected to hit $461.25 billion by 2030.

(“BBH”) to terminate the proposed acquisition of BBH’s Investor Services business, State Street STT announced additional share repurchases. The company intends to buy back $500 million worth of shares during the fourth quarter of 2022. This brings the total authorization to $1.5 billion for the quarter.Also, State Street plans to return more than 80% of its earnings next year. The company chairman and CEO, Ron O’Hanley said, “We recognize the priority our shareholders place on capital return, and we continue to expect to use dividends and share repurchases to return significantly more capital than our medium term target payout of 80% of earnings in 2023.”Hence, the investor-friendly decision was cheered by the market participants, and STT’s share price soared 8.2% yesterday. Another reason for the bullish stance is that many banks are doing away with share repurchases and dividend hikes on higher capital requirements and deteriorating economic outlook. One such big name is JPMorgan JPM. The company, in order to meet higher future capital requirements amid macroeconomic woes, temporarily suspended buybacks. Also, JPM kept the quarterly dividend unchanged at $1 per share despite clearing the 2022 stress test in June.State Street paused share repurchases at the time of announcing the transaction to acquire the above-mention business in September 2021. However, the deal faced unprecedented delays. So, on Nov 30, both companies decided to terminate the agreement as it wasn’t “in the best interests of clients, shareholders or employees to continue to invest time and resources in the transaction in this challenging financial services M&amp;A environment.”Further, following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, State Street announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to 63 cents per share in July 2022. Considering the last day’s closing price, STT’s dividend yield currently stands at 3.39%. The yield is attractive for income investors and represents a steady income stream.State Street remains well-poised with respect to fundamental business activities, given the global exposure, higher interest rates and a broad array of innovative products and services (including the launch of State Street Digital and State Street Alpha). These efforts, along with new business servicing wins and inorganic growth strategy, are expected to keep supporting revenues.So far this year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 13.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 20%.

21,b6e0c808-3d86-39e2-aa6a-9b1294317956,MMC,2022-12-09,"Health Benefit Cost Rose 3.2% in 2022, but Employers See Bigger Increases Ahead, Mercer Survey",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/health-benefit-cost-rose-3-140300233.html,1670508180,STORY,['MMC'],"[US employers expect a sharper increase of 5.4% in 2023 -- and faster cost growth in the years ahead seems likelyFor now, most employers are prioritizing enhancing benefits to attract and retain workers over cost-cutting; enhancements range from adding perks to improving healthcare affordabilityMental health remains a top concern of employers and employees – and virtual mental healthcare is proving key to improving access to servicesNEW YORK, December 08, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The average per-employee cost of employer-sponsored health insurance rose by 3.2% in 2022, according to Mercer’s 2022 National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, released today (Fig 1). Last year saw a spike in cost growth (to 6.3%) as individuals caught up on healthcare needs delayed as a result of the pandemic. While this year’s increase may seem like a return to normal trend, it is far below general inflation, which is averaging about 8% for 2022. Typically, health benefit cost growth runs higher than general inflation. According to Sunit Patel, Chief Health Actuary at Mercer, 2022 is an anomaly because employer health plan sponsors haven’t felt the full impact of inflation yet.""In the healthcare sector, higher wages, labor shortages, and consolidation will almost certainly result in higher prices,"" Patel said. ""One reason cost growth lagged inflation this year is because healthcare providers typically have multi-year contracts with health plans. So although employers did not feel the full brunt of inflation immediately, it’s very likely that inflation-driven cost increases will phase in over the next few years as contracts are renewed.""Employers did project a higher average increase for next year -- 5.4% -- and Patel cautions they should be prepared for continued accelerated cost growth in 2024 and beyond.Total health benefit cost per employee reached $15,013 on average in 2022, with small organizations (50-499 employees) reporting slightly higher costs than large organizations (500 or more employees). While large employers generally offer richer benefits than small employers, most are able to self-fund their medical plans (saving on insurance company risk charges), and they typically have more resources to devote to health program management.Story continuesKeeping healthcare affordableCost growth may be on the rise, but employers continue to face a tight labor market and are well aware that healthcare benefits weigh heavily in employment decisions. Mercer’s survey asked employers to rate their strategic priorities for their benefits programs for the next few years. Prior to the pandemic, employers most often prioritized cost-management strategies; this year ""enhancing benefits to improve attraction and retention"" topped the list, with 84% of large employers rating it important or very important). Also high on the list were ""adding programs/service to expand access to behavioral healthcare"" (73%) and ""improving healthcare affordability"" (68%).In today’s inflationary environment, with many employees concerned about their ability simply to cover their monthly bills, affordable healthcare is even more critical. In a recent Mercer survey of over 4,000 US employees, 68% said they feel challenged in getting needed healthcare, and the most common challenge cited was being able to afford healthcare expenses that aren’t covered by insurance.Given the focus on affordability, it is not surprising that, despite expectations of higher healthcare costs, most leaders are avoiding ""healthcare cost shifting,"" or giving plan members more responsibility for the cost of health services through higher deductibles or copays; there was little change in the median amount of these cost-sharing features in 2022. The survey also found employers are continuing to back away from offering a high-deductible account-based plan as the only option, particularly among the very large organizations (20,000 or more employees) that had been the fastest to adopt this so-called ""full-replacement"" strategy. Just 9% of these employers now offer a high-deductible plan as the only option at the largest worksite, down from 13% in 2021, and 22% four years ago in 2018.In addition, more of these very large employers used salary-based premiums in 2022 (34%, up from 29% in 2021), by which lower-wage workers see smaller paycheck deductions for health coverage than those with higher salaries.""The affordability issue cuts both ways. Employers will be challenged to absorb the higher costs coming down the pike, but they also know some people will forego important care when they feel they can’t afford it,"" said Tracy Watts, National Leader for US Health Policy, Mercer. ""Particularly with inflation putting added stress on household finances, budget concerns need to be balanced with the downstream implications of healthcare affordability. So the focus now is on strategies to rein in cost growth without shifting the cost to the employee.""How employers are managing cost without shifting the cost to employeesThe survey found that about a third of all large employers (35%) – and more than half of very large employers (53%) – say that steering employees to high-performing provider networks and other sources of high-value care is an important strategy for them. More than a third of very large employers (36%) offer a telephonic navigation and advocacy service to help members find the right provider based on quality and cost, and 17% offer a digital navigation tool.One of the biggest health benefit cost drivers is high-cost specialty drugs, such as those used to treat complex medical conditions like cancer and autoimmune disorders. Large employers reported that spending on specialty drugs rose by nearly 10% in 2022, and still higher increases are expected as more breakthrough gene and cellular therapies enter the market, with the FDA estimating that by 2025 it will be approving 10 to 20 gene and cell therapy products per year. Over a third of large employers (34%) say they will add or enhance stop-loss protection (a form of insurance for large claims for self-funded employers) in anticipation of an increase in very large claims, and about a fourth will work with their carriers and pharmacy benefits managers on cost and clinical management strategies.Virtual mental healthcare is a bright spotGrowth in virtual mental healthcare is part of a larger trend: Employers are adding many types of virtual healthcare solutions to their programs, and utilization rates for traditional telemedicine have jumped since the pandemic began. At the same time, the demand for mental healthcare is growing. More than ever before, employers view supporting the mental, emotional and behavioral health of employees as a business imperative – especially given that ""burnout"" is one of the top three reasons employees consider leaving their jobs.A Mercer survey of more than 700 organizations conducted earlier this year that focused on strategies for 2023 asked about actions employers would take to provide greater support for behavioral health. Over half (52%) of large survey respondents say employees will have access to virtual behavioral healthcare in 2023.""Even before the pandemic, there was a shortage of mental health providers and that has not changed. What has changed is the explosion of virtual mental healthcare as an alternative to in-person care,"" added Watts. ""Being able to receive care in the privacy of one’s home – and saving the time and cost of traveling to a physical office – is a game-changer for many people.""People’s willingness to use virtual mental healthcare is demonstrated by an analysis of data in MercerFOCUS, which warehouses the claims of over 1 million health plan members. There was a substantial increase in the number of people accessing outpatient behavioral health services in 2021, from 73 members per 1,000 to 83. Notably, virtual mental health visits – essentially non-existent prior to the pandemic – were utilized by 39 members per 1,000, suggesting that the availability of this option resulted in more people getting mental health support.""It is encouraging that so many employers have prioritized mental health in their health program strategies – not just at the benefit level but in an organization’s culture as well. In a Mercer survey conducted earlier this year, more than a third of large employers are training managers to recognize behavioral health issues and direct employees to existing resources,"" says Watts. ""Ideally, behavioral healthcare will become an integrated, essential part of healthcare, in which an anxiety disorder or burnout is easily identified and addressed – and without stigma.""Survey MethodologyMercer’s National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans included 2,028 public and private employers in 2022. Based on responses from employers in a national probability sample in combination with a non-probability sample, survey results have been weighted (using employer size and geographic stratification) to represent the approximately 170,000 employer health plan sponsors across the US with 50 or more employees. These organizations employ about 124 million full- and part-time employees.The full report on the Mercer survey, including a separate appendix of tables of responses broken out by employer size, region, and industry, will be published in March 2023.

Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Norwegian Cruise Line due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Norwegian Cruise Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesNorwegian Cruise reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, both metrics improved year over year.The company is benefiting from improving occupancy. In the third quarter of 2022, occupancy improved 17 basis points to nearly 82%. The company anticipates occupancy levels to improve and reach historical levels for the second quarter of 2023. In fourth-quarter 2022, the company expects occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80 percent range.Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionNorwegian Cruise reported an adjusted loss per share of 64 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 71 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported a loss per share of $2.17.Quarterly revenues of $1,615.5 million beat the consensus mark of $1,576 million. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported revenues of $153.1 million. The upside can primarily be attributed to the resumption of cruise operations.In the quarter under review, passenger ticket revenues were $1,105.9 million compared with $86.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Onboard and other revenues increased to $509.6 million from $67 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Expenses &amp; Operating ResultsTotal cruise operating expenses increased 181.7% in the quarter under review from the year-ago quarter’s levels. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages. The company noted that the increase in 2022 reflects an improvement in payroll, fuel and direct variable costs of fully operating ships.Gross cruise costs in the third quarter increased 141.3% year over year to $1,614.2 million. Adjusted net cruise costs (excluding fuel) amounted to $947.7 million compared with $538 million in the prior-year quarter. Fuel price per metric ton (net of hedges) increased to $830 from $693 in 2021.Net interest expenses in the quarter were $152.3 million, up from $161.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesBalance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2022, were $1.2 billion compared with $1.5 billion at the end of Dec 31, 2021. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2022, came in at $12.9 billion compared with $11.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2021.Guidance &amp; Booking UpdatesThe company said that booked position for fourth-quarter 2022 is below the comparable 2019 level. However, booking trends for 2023 remain in line with that of 2019. Pricing is meaningfully higher than that of 2019 at the same point in time for the full year 2023.Due to the coronavirus outbreak and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the company is unable to estimate the impact on its business. The company expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. In fourth-quarter 2022, it anticipates net interest expenses to be nearly $170 million. For the full year, it expects the same to be $610 million, excluding losses on extinguishment of debt. Depreciation and amortization are forecast to be roughly $195 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $740 million for the full year of 2022.The company expects occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80% range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Capacity days are anticipated to be 5.1 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be in the range of $1.4-$1.5 billion. Adjusted net cruise cost (excluding fuel per capacity day) is likely to decline nearly 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -23.59% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Norwegian Cruise Line has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Norwegian Cruise Line has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNorwegian Cruise Line belongs to the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Royal Caribbean (RCL), has gained 7.6% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Royal Caribbean reported revenues of $2.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +555%.

In the past three months, shares of the company have gained 5.9% against the industry’s fall of 1.4%. However, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions pose concerns.Let us discuss why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.Key CatalystsNorwegian Cruise is benefitting from improvements in occupancy. In third-quarter 2022, occupancy was approximately 82%, in line with the company’s expectations. In the previous quarter, the company had reported occupancy of 65%. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company expects occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80% range. Although seasonality-induced headwinds are likely to persist during the fourth quarter, the company anticipates sequential improvements in load factor, with sequential gap reduction (of about 20%) from 2019 levels. The company anticipates occupancy ramp-up to continue and reach historical levels (of 100% plus) during the second quarter of 2023. Relaxation in COVID-related protocols is likely to add to the positives.Norwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size to drive growth. It has plans to introduce eight more ships through 2027. Most of them are on order for the Norwegian Cruise Line, while the rest are for Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. For the Regent brand, it has one Explorer Class Ship to be delivered in 2023. For the Oceania Cruises brand, the company has two Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2023 and 2025. With the project Leonardo, Norwegian Cruise will have an additional six ships with expected delivery dates from 2022 through 2027. In 2023, the company anticipates the additions of Norwegian Viva, Oceania Cruises Vista and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur to its fleet.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesSequential improvements in booking activities have been aiding the company. The bookings include incorporating higher pricing and the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (FCCs). As of Sep 30, 2022, the company’s advance ticket sales (including the long-term portion) were $2.5 billion compared with $2.2 billion reported in the previous quarter. The amount includes FCCs worth approximately $258 million. Although the cumulative booked position for the fourth quarter of 2022 is below the comparable 2019 levels, the company stated that booking trends for 2023 remain in line with the record of 2019. Pricing is also higher than 2019 levels at the same point in time for the full year 2023. The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods.The company emphasizes on its booking window to drive top-line. The initiative not only evaluates the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel but also provides better visibility for price increases and moderating marketing expenses. During the third quarter of 2022, the booking window was approximately 245 days, nearly 10% ahead of 2019 levels. The company anticipates the indicator to be a driving factor of sales in the upcoming periods.ConcernsThe company’s operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Also, geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, the management has decided to withdraw all activity in Russia. During the third quarter of 2022, the company’s performance was negatively impacted by the absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries. Also, it stated that the impacts of COVID-19 (on the shipyards), Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and other macroeconomic events, have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries. The company anticipates the close-end nature of the deployment change and its inability to find alternatives for the itineraries to disrupt booking patterns for some time.Norwegian Cruise has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the third quarter of 2022, total cruise operating expenses increased 181.7% year over year to $ 1,238.9 million. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages. The company noted that the increase in 2022 reflects an improvement in payroll, fuel, and direct variable costs of fully operating ships. Also, inflationary pressures relating to food, perishables, and logistics added to the woes. The company anticipates inflation and global supply chain constraints to dent margins in the near term.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderNorwegian Cruise currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

26,b2bac430-1706-396f-a40a-26be0a0992b7,NCLH,2022-12-09,J.P. Morgan Says These 2 Stocks Could Surge Over 90% From Current Levels,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-p-morgan-says-2-143855700.html,1670510335,STORY,"['NCLH', 'PLRX']","[Investors searching for that feeling telling you market sentiment is shifting to a more positive outlook have been brought down to earth again. Following 2022’s market behavior to a tee, the recent rally has run into a brick wall. To wit, the S&amp;P 500 notched 5 consecutive negative sessions over the last week with investors mulling over the prospect of a recession.Indeed, financial experts have been sounding the warning bells on the precarious state of the global economy. One of the doomsayers has been J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who said recently that the Fed’s rate-hiking endeavors might not be enough to stave off a recession after all.However, not all stocks are destined for the bargain bin. In fact, while Dimon fears for the economy, the analysts at JPMorgan see two names bucking the trend and pushing higher over the coming months – to the tune of 90% or more. Do other analysts agree with JPM? We’ve opened the TipRanks database to find out. Here’s the lowdown.Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)The first JPM-endorsed name we’ll look at is Norwegian Cruise Line, one of the biggest cruise companies in the world. Norwegian owns and operates three separate cruise lines, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, with a total ship count of 28, riding the waves to 490+ destinations worldwide.The last few years have been one long headache for the cruise-line industry. Unable to operate during the pandemic, the reopening came as welcome relief. The return to normalcy, however, has been interrupted with worries about the struggling global economy amidst soaring inflation and rising input costs. However, there appears to be plenty of pent-up demand too and with Norwegian focused on the premium market, its target audience might be less likely to feel the pinch of a recession.In the company’s latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, revenue saw a huge 958% year-over-year increase to reach $1.62 billion, while the company delivered adj. EPS of -$0.64. Both results beat Street expectations. Occupancy rates are also getting better and reached around 82% of pre-pandemic levels. These are expected to keep on improving and reach the mid-to-high 80% range in Q4.Story continuesCovering the stock for J.P. Morgan, analyst Daniel Adam writes that he's bullish on NCLH’s prospects, including among his reasons: “(1) disciplined market-to-fill (as opposed to discount-to-fill) pricing strategy; (2) outsized growth potential versus peers, as NCLH has a smaller, nimbler, and younger fleet with premium pricing; and (3) attractive relative valuation — particularly using estimates two or more years out.”“In terms of size,” Adam went on to add, “NCLH commands only ~9% of the global cruise market. Accordingly, while it lacks the same scale benefits enjoyed by larger peers (CCL at ~38% capacity share and RCL at ~18%), NCLH has a greater opportunity for growth, which we consider a positive against the backdrop of strong pent-up leisure travel demand and the attractive value proposition that cruise lines offer versus land-based vacation alternatives.”Accordingly, Adam rates NCLH shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), while his $30 price target makes room for 12-month gains of 94%. (To watch Adam’s track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. 6 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell add up to a Moderate Buy consensus. The shares are expected to reward investors with returns of 31% a year from now, considering the average target stands at $20.30. (See NCLH stock forecast on TipRanks)Pliant Therapeutics (PLRX)We’ll now pivot to a completely different sector for the next JPM pick. Pliant Therapeutics is a clinical biotech company with a remit to develop and bring to market novel treatments for a range of fibrotic diseases. The aim is to halt their progression, thereby safeguarding organ function.The company’s lead candidate is bexotegrast (PLN-74809), an inhibitor of the αvβ6/αvβ1 integrins, which is being assessed in phase 2 studies for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In partnership with Novartis, the company is also developing αvβ1 inhibitor PLN-1474, whose phase 1 trial concluded in 2021 with the drug now moving towards phase 2 studies. There are also treatments for solid tumors and muscular dystrophy still in the pre-clinical stages.PLRX shares have surged 156% higher over the past 6 months. The gains can be attributed to the results in the phase 2a study (INTEGRIS) of PLN-74809 in IPF, in which the drug met both its primary and secondary endpoints. Further updates from the high dose (320mg) cohort are expected in early 2023 and mid-way through the year.It is LN-74809's potential that has piqued the interest of JPMorgan's Eric Joseph.“In our view,” said the analyst, “lead candidate bexotegrast (PLN-74809) - a novel, dual selective αvβ1 inhibitor enjoys compelling biologic rationale for the treatment of IPF with an emerging mid-stage development field. In view of the multi-billion dollar commercial opportunity in IPF, we see current levels as not reflecting bexotegrast’s commercial potential in IPF and see additional optionality for bexotegrast in PSC.”“Relative to some other mid-late-stage IPF development programs,” Joseph further explained, “we believe the INTEGRIS data set and (phase 3 program expected to similarly incorporate SoC) should set up '809 for a differentiated label breadth and flexibility of utilization- furthermore, our physician feedback indicates high preference for orals over IV administrated products in this category.”Underpinning these comments with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and $42 price target, Joseph sees the stock yielding additional returns of 130% over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Joseph’s track record, click here)Joseph’s confident outlook is no anomaly; all 4 other recent analyst reviews are positive too, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The average target is slightly higher than Joseph’s objective; at $43.60, the figure suggests share gains of 139% are in the cards for the coming year.

PLN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""The key flaw in the presentation of the list of plants to retire is a lack of disclosure on the selection criteria,"" Elrika Hamdi, energy finance analyst at IEEFA, said in the report.""A reasonable level of transparency and disclosure is required to justify why some plants are better than others,"" she said, adding that the level of pollution generated and the overall marginal cost of operation should be key factors.The same concern applies to the lack of disclosure on the selection process of the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) first potential transaction for an early coal power plant retirement, Hamdi said.Indonesia, the ADB and a private power firm announced last month they are teaming up to refinance and prematurely retire a 660-megawatt power plant in West Java.The report added that with all the schemes running simultaneously and the long lead time of each transition, Indonesia also needs to ensure strong governance and long term political commitment.(Reporting by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Martin Petty)]"

But the portion of cash that flows to shareholders may be higher because companies will spend less on debt repayment, BMO's managing director of oil and gas equity research Randy Ollenberger said.""We don’t see 2023 as being challenging for the sector given the improvement to balance sheets,"" he said.Most large- and mid-size producers expect to be net-debt-free in the second half of 2023, according to BMO. Net debt represents a company's gross debt minus cash and cash-like assets.Companies might accelerate buybacks next year ahead of Canada's planned 2% buyback tax, which takes effect in 2024, according to CIBC.One company with cash to spend is Bonterra Energy Corp, a conventional oil producer extracting 13,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.It faced an existential threat in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic crushed oil prices. A government-backed loan helped sustain it and as prices rebounded, Bonterra repaid the loan, along with C$150 million in debt during the past year as of the third quarter.Bonterra expects to pay off its remaining C$38 million bank debt by the third quarter 2023, and still have options like initiating a dividend, raising production or repaying debt further, Chief Executive Officer Pat Oliver told Reuters.""It's been a radical transformation of balance sheets over the last couple of years, an amazing turnaround from where we were,"" Oliver said.Story continuesCanadian Natural Resources, the country's biggest oil producer, said on Nov. 30 that it will raise shareholder returns to 80% to 100% of free cash flow from 50%, once it reduces net debt to C$8 billion. An analyst said this would likely happen late next year.The TSX energy index has generated 46% year to date as of Thursday, though down 17% since peaking in June. The benchmark Canadian share index is down nearly 6% for the year.""There was a higher debt-load going through COVID, and now (producers) have got options,"" said Ryan Bushell, President of Newhaven Asset Management, which holds shares in Canadian Natural and ARC Resources Ltd.Producers generated big profits due to high prices this year fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices have since slid to around $72 per barrel from a 14-year high of $130.50 in March. Canadian producers also absorb a $29 per barrel discount due to distance from U.S. refineries and lower heavy oil demand.That discount may worsen after the Keystone oil pipeline shut down on Wednesday.If oil prices dip below $65, companies may tighten spending but opt to reduce capital budgets before shareholder returns, Bushell said.($1 = 1.3599 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

That would be some 4.5 percentage points below the year's peak in March.At least the numbers are expected to be reliable. Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Friday it was cancelling next week's producer price report after discovering further potential problems with the calculation of the series dogged by errors in diesel and food prices.The disinflation theme more generally has been encouraged by the plunge in Brent crude oil prices this week to their lowest of the year below $76 per barrel, although a major leak lifted U.S. prices marginally on Friday.Canada's TC Energy shut its Keystone pipeline in the United States after more than 14,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into a creek in Kansas, making it one of the largest crude spills in the United States in nearly a decade.Hopes for a China economic reboot, however, lifted London copper prices, which rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday to hit their highest in more than five months.Story continuesU.S. stock futures were marginally higher ahead of Wall Street's open after the S&amp;P500 broke a 5-day losing streak on Thursday. U.S. Treasury yields were steady after rebounding from 3-month lows yesterday. The dollar was a touch lower.Elsewhere, Britain's finance ministry on Friday set out plans to overhaul the financial sector, including a review of rules to make bankers accountable for their decisions and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders.Credit Suisse stock rose another 3% after it hailed on Thursday a ""milestone"" in its turnaround plan after raising 2.24 billion Swiss francs ($2.39 billion) as part of a 4 billion franc fund raising. Shareholders exercised 98.4% of their subscription rights, giving a boost to managers tasked with getting the Swiss bank back on track after the biggest crisis in its 166-year history.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* U.S. Nov producer prices, University of Michigan's Dec consumer sentiment* U.S. Federal Reserve issues quarterly financial accounts of the United States* U.S. corporate earnings: Oracle Graphic: China's negative PPI, slowing CPI growth in Nov, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/xmvjkkgmqpr/chart.png Graphic: Jobless claims, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klpyggemlpg/joblessclaims2.png Graphic: Heading the wrong direction? https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/znvnbbdqyvl/chart.png(By Mike Dolan, editing by Jane Merriman mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

The Canadian company said it initiated an energy shutdown and response at 8 p.m. CT on Wednesday after alarms went off detecting a pressure drop in the system.The cause of the leak is not known. It is not immediately clear as of presstime when the pipeline is expected to come back online.The affected segment of the Keystone pipeline system ""has been isolated"" and remains shut, the company said.The leak at Keystone is the largest oil leak since a Tesoro Corp. pipeline leak in October 2013 that released more than 20,000 barrels of oil in North Dakota, Reuters reported, citing data from the US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA. It's the Keystone's seventh spill since starting operations in June 2010, Reuters reported, citing PHMSA data.The PHMSA on Thursday said it's investigating the leak. It has ordered TC Energy to keep the pipeline shut until it authorizes a restart.Leaks from Keystone are problematic because the pipeline carries tar sands and spills containing this substance are harder to clean up. Fears about such spills have already thwarted the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension projection, which President Joe Biden canceled in January 2021, even though the construction had already begun.Keystone's shutdown sent US West Texas Intermediate futures soaring over 4% to top $75 a barrel on Thursday.

Higher interest rates dry up the market, resulting in less room for leverage buyouts, new debt issues, mergers, acquisitions, etc. Even though the investment banking arm of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is smaller than some of its peers, it is one of the firms most affected by rate hikes because of its credit ratings business.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MS. Click here to check it out. MS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MSPeter Lynch Chart of MSPutting these short-term issues aside, though, Morgan Stanley has shown resiliency over the years and has healthy shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Additionally, the launch of the new exchange-traded funds will help the firm to diversify a little more, achieve some trading flexibility and limit its leverage. Thus, could a value opportunity open up soon for investors interested in Morgan Stanley?Morgan Stanley is being dealt heavy blowsInvestors hoping for a solid third quarter from Morgan Stanley stand bitterly disappointed. The investment bank's third-quarter results were far below expectations, with a drop in both revenue and profit. The cause of this disappointing performance was the weak global economy, which has been hit hard by the afteraffects of the pandemic and the raging bull market that was born from extreme monetary stimulus.With businesses worldwide struggling, there has been less demand for Morgan Stanley's services. This has hit the bank's bottom line, with its shares falling sharply in response to the news.Morgan Stanley Is Heading Into 2023 in Battered ShapeHowever, despite this weak quarter, Morgan Stanley remains one of the strongest banks in the world and is expected to bounce back when the economy recovers. Perhaps this is why the stock is still miles above pre-Covid levels.Morgan Stanleys revenue fell by 11.9% to $12.99 billion in the third quarter and missed analyst estimates by $320 million. Moreover, the earnings of $1.47 per diluted share were significantly below the $1.97 per share reported in the third quarter of 2021. The major culprit was its investment banking revenue, down 54% from the prior year and worse than most of its peers. However, the banking giant saw significant growth in its net interest income, which saw a surge of 49% year-over-year, slightly offsetting the negative effects of its investment banking segment.Story continuesMoreover, the good news is that part of the companys revenue comes from the asset management arm, which is expected to deliver $20 billion by the end of this year. The wealth management segment reported revenues of $6.1 billion in the third quarter compared to $5.9 billion last year. The segment also picked up $65 billion in net new assets, a great sign considering the circumstances.Shareholder returns continue to be healthyAt a time when many investors are reeling from negative earnings results, Morgan Stanley believes that returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends is a wonderful way to reward them for their loyalty in continuing to hold the stock. It is the best time to pursue this strategy, as it will help to shore up investor confidence and encourage more people to invest in the stock market.While some critics argue that this strategy is a short-term fix, Morgan Stanley believes it is a sound long-term investment. By returning capital to shareholders, the company is signaling its confidence in the future of its business and its commitment to rewarding its investors. This is a crucial message to send in today's uncertain economic climate.At the time of writing, Morgan Stanley has a trailing dividend yield of 3.39% compared to the 3.02% industry average. Furthermore, the company has a payout ratio of 0.42 compared to the sector average of 0.24In addition, Morgan Stanley had announced a share repurchase program of up to $20 billion earlier in June 2022. The repurchase program was set to initiate in the latest quarter with no expiration date. Under the program, Morgan Stanley purchased $2.6 billion in shares in the third quarter.On top of that, Morgan Stanley issued new P series preferred stock in July with a 6.5% dividend yield and an initial price of $25 to the public.Morgan Stanley enters the world of ETFsIn August, Morgan Stanley announced its plans to launch its first four exchange-traded funds. In November, the firm launched its first ETF after a long hiatus; the Innovator Equity Managed Floor ETF (SFLR). The highest weight in the fund has been given to the Information Technology sector at 30.12%, followed by the Health Care and Consumer Discretionary sectors at 14.55% and 11.36%, respectively.Launching these ETFs is a great move from Morgan Stanley and will help immensely reduce investor concerns. Over the past few months, there has been a lot of uncertainty in the markets, and investors have been increasingly seeking out safe havens for their money. Given Morgan Stanley's strong reputation as a financial institution, these ETFs are likely to be well-received by investors looking for stability in these volatile times. Furthermore, the fact that the ETFs are based on indexes gives them an added layer of protection against market fluctuations. Overall, I think this is a smart move by Morgan Stanley that is likely to pay off handsomely in the current climate.TakeawayMorgan Stanley's investment bank and credit ratings businesses have taken a hit in the last few quarters due to a wide variety of economic factors. However, Morgan Stanley has a long history of market resilience. Plus, the company is doing well with dividends and shareholder returns. Additionally, launching the new exchange-traded funds will help the firm diversify and achieve greater flexibility. This move is strategic as it allows Morgan Stanley to enter into a market that is growing rapidly and where it can compete quite easily, given its size and scope. Furthermore, this diversification will help offset any potential losses from its core businesses in case of a further downturn.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(CVE:INCA) will have been dismayed by the negative share price return over the last three years. In addition, the company's per-share earnings growth is not looking good, despite growing revenues. The AGM coming up on 15 December 2022 will be an opportunity for shareholders to have their concerns addressed by the board and for them to exercise their influence on management through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration. Here's our take on why we think shareholders might be hesitant about approving a raise at the moment. Check out our latest analysis for Inca One Gold Comparing Inca One Gold Corp.'s CEO Compensation With The IndustryAccording to our data, Inca One Gold Corp. has a market capitalization of CA$7.7m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$301k over the year to April 2022. We note that's a decrease of 27% compared to last year. Notably, the salary which is US$187.3k, represents most of the total compensation being paid.On comparing similar-sized companies in the industry with market capitalizations below CA$272m, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$133k. This suggests that Ed Kelly is paid more than the median for the industry. Furthermore, Ed Kelly directly owns CA$227k worth of shares in the company.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$187kUS$195k62%OtherUS$114kUS$218k38%Total CompensationUS$301kUS$413k100%Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 88% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 12% of the pie. It's interesting to note that Inca One Gold allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation veers towards salary, it suggests that the variable portion - which is generally tied to performance, is lower.ceo-compensationA Look at Inca One Gold Corp.'s Growth NumbersOver the last three years, Inca One Gold Corp. has shrunk its earnings per share by 27% per year. It achieved revenue growth of 57% over the last year.Story continuesThe decrease in EPS could be a concern for some investors. On the other hand, the strong revenue growth suggests the business is growing. These two metrics are moving in different directions, so while it's hard to be confident judging performance, we think the stock is worth watching. We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Has Inca One Gold Corp. Been A Good Investment?Few Inca One Gold Corp. shareholders would feel satisfied with the return of -35% over three years. So shareholders would probably want the company to be less generous with CEO compensation.In Summary...The returns to shareholders is disappointing along with lack of earnings growth, which goes some way in explaining the poor returns. The upcoming AGM will provide shareholders the opportunity to revisit the company’s remuneration policies and evaluate if the board’s judgement and decision-making is aligned with that of the company’s shareholders.It is always advisable to analyse CEO pay, along with performing a thorough analysis of the company's key performance areas. We did our research and identified 4 warning signs (and 3 which can't be ignored) in Inca One Gold we think you should know about.Switching gears from Inca One Gold, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this free list of high return, low debt companies is a great place to look.Have feedback on this article?

Benioff didn’t acknowledge Taylor’s absence, and a press event scheduled after the speech with the soon-to-be sole CEO was canceled.Benioff and Taylor shared keynote speeches at earlier conferences this year including Dreamforce, the company’s annual major event in September.

Days after Taylor’s announcement, three executives from Slack, the business communications platform Salesforce acquired last year for more than $27 billion, said they were departing the company. The exits included Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield, who was seen as a possible successor to Taylor. Butterfield said his exit was unrelated to Taylor’s departure and long-planned.Meanwhile, the software company has projected its slowest growth ever and is under pressure from activists including Starboard Value to improve margins. The shares have tumbled 19% since Taylor’s Nov. 30 resignation announcement and have plunged 49% this year.Story continuesThe event in New York is an example of the promotional spending that Salesforce is famous for, and may need to scale back to improve margins. Benioff’s keynote was preceded by an appearance by New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and a television commercial featuring Matthew McConaughey. “We’re known for our towers, we’re known for our events,” Taylor said last year in an interview with Greylock Partners.Franklin, the CMO, told a group of reporters that Salesforce isn’t planning to reduce the number of events as a cost-cutting measure. She added that many aspects of conferences such as Dreamforce are sponsored, and the company is looking to boost that mix. Franklin acknowledged that customers have been asking about Taylor’s departure.A demonstration during Benioff’s speech highlighted that it will now be easier to use Tableau, a data visualization program acquired in 2019 for nearly $14 billion, to view information stored in other Salesforce services. Much of Tableau’s leadership team has been gutted this year — last week, CEO Mark Nelson stepped down, about a year and a half after the resignation of its previous leader, Adam Selipsky.(Updates with comments from chief marketing officer in the eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmEx Hooked Big Spenders and Regained the Throne With a Pricier Platinum CardTikTok’s Problem Child Has 7 Million Followers and One Proud MomElon Musk’s Twitter Is a Shakespearean Psychodrama Set in Silicon ValleyLong Covid’s Effects Go Beyond Respiratory IssuesThe FUD Behind the Crypto Collapse©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

And Wall Street's not taking the news well. Shares saw their worst day since 2020 this week, and they're taking a hit this morning after a downgrade from investment firm Baird. To the drama-- the drama, I should say, caught the attention of Mr. Sozzi, and that's where we find his take today. You follow this company pretty closely.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. It's-- first of all, I have to give a hat tip to Emily Glazer over ""The Wall Street Journal."" They reported some tensions internally over at Salesforce between now outgoing co-CEO Bret Taylor and founder Marc Benioff. Just my interactions with both of them, they're two very distinctly different people. I think Bret has been very, I think, focused on operational execution and getting-- talking to CEOs a lot outside of the company.Marc Benioff is Marc Benioff. He's a big presence. But I think he wanted to maybe pull back a little bit here and start focusing on other efforts and his other various endeavors.But again, here are a couple problems here I think that is ultimately hurting Salesforce and at some point they're going to have to address. You have that C-suite exodus. Not only is Taylor leaving, you also have Slack founder Stewart Butterfield. He recently said he was leaving about a week and a half ago. You had Tableau's CEO leave as well.So-- there's also been a couple other people leave at Slack in addition too. This comes at a time where the company is really trying to focus on improving its operating margins. And oh, yeah, that's also happening while sales growth is slowing. And again, you have this leadership uncertainty not just within the CEOs of each or some of these brands, but also that next level or third level down inside of Salesforce.And to that end, we just recently caught up with Brent Thill. He's been covering Salesforce for a long while. Take a listen to his comments on what he thinks is bugging or really weighing on Salesforce shares here.Story continuesBRENT THILL: Again, I have huge admiration for Mark, but I think investors right now have lost confidence in his ability to get control of the expenses and actually drive this through this recession. And so, you know, again, that's investor sentiment.BRIAN SOZZI: You know, I was thinking back over to Dreamforce. That, of course, is the big Salesforce annual conference. And I asked Marc about the focus on operating profits and operating margins. It is-- they have been lagging a lot of peers in the industry, and it reflects a lot of the acquisitions the company has made over the past five years-- Slack, Tableau, you name it, MuleSoft. And Marc said, I don't think the market appreciates how much we're focused on operating margins.And to that point, here's my take. Marc's going to have to prove that this company can get its operating margins up next year, and they can do so in a big way. They have the brands. They have the scale. They have the market share. And there I am with Marc Benioff in those clouds, you know, wanting to see them do well. I mean, this is a good company doing a lot of good, interesting things on the tech front, and they do have a good opportunity to bring those margins up.- I think what Salesforce did well very early on was making CRM and SAS sexy. It was a user interface that people would rather spend mass amount of times in if you had to, if you put that up against Oracle or SAP. But that was now 10 years ago. And so now for the disruption that they've been able to do, the acquisitions that they've been able to strategically move forward with, and now that next leg of growth that they're trying to initiate, what is the next reinvention for that user experience that's going to really upcycle that next wave of customers that are going to hop into the ecosystem?BRIAN SOZZI: Well, on the positive side, I think they have successfully integrated Slack with Tableau, and MuleSoft, and Salesforce. All these products are now being sold in one uniform way. That's good. And there is a lot of innovation coming on Slack, and MuleSoft, and Tableau. But again, they're going have to drive a lot more of it and perhaps hold off on making that next big acquisition, even though valuations for a lot of companies that they are eyeing have come down considerably and really, I think, next year about execution, improving margins in all of those businesses.- All right.- All right.]"

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Flowserve's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Flowserve How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Flowserve is:5.5% = US$93m ÷ US$1.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Flowserve's Earnings Growth And 5.5% ROEOn the face of it, Flowserve's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 13%. Flowserve was still able to see a decent net income growth of 12% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Flowserve's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 7.3% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is FLS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether FLS is currently mispriced by the market.Is Flowserve Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Flowserve has a three-year median payout ratio of 70% (which means it retains 30% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Besides, Flowserve has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 45% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 14% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Flowserve has some positive aspects to its business. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty substantial, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low, meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) is preparing to respond to potential power outages and urges customers to be prepared as well.PG&amp;E meteorologists, along with experts from the National Weather Service, forecast that a potent storm system is expected to arrive in our service area overnight Friday before moving southward Saturday. This weather system is expected to produce rain, heavy at times, strong gusty winds, and heavy mountain snow across the Sierra. The strong winds in the 40-50 mph range may be widespread with gusts in excess of 50-55 mph possible for the northern areas, coastal strip north of Monterey, and across the northern San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys.PG&amp;E’s all-hands-on-deck response will be prepared to address any issues caused by the adverse weather which could result in trees, limbs and other debris falling onto powerlines, damaging equipment and interrupting electric service. PG&amp;E vegetation management crews work year-round to keep trees away from powerlines, including before a storm.We have a plan to respond to outages and have activated our companywide Emergency Operations Center to more efficiently allocate crews, materials and other resources for restoration efforts across our service area. Local PG&amp;E operations emergency centers will also activate in impacted regions to provide efficient support to our customers.""We are actively tracking the weather around the clock and supporting our local Electric Operations crews who are at the ready to respond to outage activity as quickly as possible,"" said Evan Duffey, a PG&amp;E meteorologist. ""We urge customers to pay close attention to the weather and keep their situational awareness high to effectively respond to weather-related emergencies, as well as having an emergency plan in place to prepare for outages.""Story continuesPG&amp;E’s meteorology team utilizes our Storm Outage Prediction Model that incorporates real-time weather forecasts, historical data and system knowledge to accurately show where and when storm impacts will be most severe. This model enables PG&amp;E to pre-stage crews and equipment, such as power poles, powerlines, and transformers, as storms approach to enable rapid response to outages.Keeping Customers InformedCustomers can view real-time outage information on our outage center website and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email or phone. PG&amp;E will send information to inform customers about the cause of an outage, repair crew response, estimated restoration time and when power has been actually restored.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action Center.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

The decline was mainly due to negative foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Book Publishing segment on account of lower physical book sales from Amazon, partly offset by higher revenues in the Dow Jones segment. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 6% negative impact on revenues. Adjusted revenues rose 3%.Total EBITDA decreased 15% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $350 million, thanks to higher costs due to inflationary pressures and lower sales. Foreign currency fluctuations had a $23-million negative impact on total segment EBITDA. Adjusted total segment EBITDA fell 13%.Segment DetailsRevenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment slipped 1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading to $421 million, induced by a 5% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment revenues increased 3%.Revenues in Move dipped 6% to $169 million due to lower real-estate revenues, somewhat offset by increased advertising revenues. Real Estate revenues, contributing 84% to total Move revenues, fell 9% due to the tough macroeconomic landscape, including higher household interest rates. The referral model generated 30% of the overall Move revenues in the reported quarter. Move’s internal data shows that average monthly unique users of Realtor.com’s web and mobile sites fell 11% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to 86 million. Lead volume also dropped 32%.Revenues at the REA Group inched up 2% to $252 million, driven by greater depth penetration, growth in national listings and higher Australian residential revenues on price increases. The upside was somewhat offset by 9% foreign currency headwinds and lower financial services revenues.The Subscription Video Services segment’s revenues were $502 million, down 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. Foreign currency fluctuations adversely impacted the segment’s revenues by 8%. Increased revenues from Kayo and BINGE as well as higher commercial and advertising revenues were partly offset by fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Adjusted segment’s revenues rose 6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $542 million.Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented nearly 25% of the overall circulation and subscription revenues compared with 19% in the prior year. Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were 4.5 million as of Sep 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. The upside can be attributed to an increase in BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partly offset by lower residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn improved slightly to 14.2% from 14% in the previous fiscal year. Broadcast ARPU grew 1% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s reading to A$83 (US$57).Revenues at the Dow Jones segment rose 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $515 million. This includes contributions of $34 million and $18 million from the buyouts of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted segment revenues grew 6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level owing to higher circulation and subscription revenues from digital subscription gains and growth in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, and increased digital advertising revenues. The segment’s digital revenues contributed 79% to total revenues compared with 75% seen in the last fiscal year.Circulation and subscription revenues improved 19% during the fiscal quarter under discussion. Circulation revenues rose 5%, driven by consistent strength in the digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues jumped 40%, mainly driven by the OPIS and CMA acquisitions and an improvement in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, offset by negative currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues represented 68% of the circulation revenues.Advertising revenues increased 4%, primarily owing to an 11% rise in digital advertising revenues, partly offset by a 6%-drop in print advertising revenues. Digital advertising accounted for nearly 65% of the total advertising revenues in the reported quarter.During the fiscal quarter, the overall average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached above 4.9 million, up 8% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 13%. Subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal jumped 8% to 3.8 million average subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal increased 13% to more than 3.1 million average subscriptions, accounting for 84% of the total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $487 million, down 11% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level, mainly due to the lower physical book sales stemming from Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of the warehouse footprint. This resulted in lower order volumes and higher returns in spite of the consumer sales data being consistent with the previous quarters’ statistics. Foreign currency headwinds also hurt revenues to the tune of 4%. Major titles in the fiscal quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner.  The segment’s adjusted revenues fell 7%. Digital sales grew 1% on increased sales of downloadable audiobooks, offset by lower e-book sales. Digital sales accounted for 23% of the consumer revenues compared with 21% in the prior fiscal year. Backlist sales represented about 65% of the overall revenues in the fiscal first quarter.Revenues in the News Media segment dipped 4% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level to $553 million in the reported quarter due to the adverse impact of 11% from the foreign currency fluctuations. This was partly offset by increased circulation and subscription revenues, and growth in advertising revenues at constant currency. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia rose 1%, while the metric at News UK declined 9%. Adjusted revenues for the segment climbed 6%.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 6% due to lower print volumes and a 12% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations.Advertising revenues dipped 4% due to negative foreign currency fluctuations of 9% because of a fall in print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group, partly due to the absence of the Euro 2020.Digital revenues contributed 36% to the News Media segment’s revenues compared with 33% in the year-ago fiscal quarter. The same accounted for 33% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. As of Sep 30, 2022, The Times and Sunday Times’ closing digital subscribers comprising the Times Literary Supplement were 468,000. The same at the News Corp Australia was 1,012,000. New York Post’s digital network attained about 151 million monthly unique users in the same month.Story continuesOther Financial AspectsNews Corporation ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,458 million, borrowings of $2,977 million and a stockholders’ equity of $7,872 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $856 million.Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

(NYSE:MSI) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-motorola-solutions-inc-100818393.html,1670580498,STORY,['MSI'],"[Readers hoping to buy Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Motorola Solutions' shares on or after the 14th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of January.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.88 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.16 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Motorola Solutions stock has a trailing yield of around 1.2% on the current share price of $269.79. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Motorola Solutions's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Motorola Solutions's payout ratio is modest, at just 45% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 52% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Motorola Solutions's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Motorola Solutions's earnings per share have been growing at 16% a year for the past five years. Motorola Solutions has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Motorola Solutions has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Motorola Solutions? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while Motorola Solutions looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Motorola Solutions you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

A big news day. The Federal Trade Commission now suing to block Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. We're joined by John Freeman, CFRA Vice President of Equity Research for a reaction on this. Good to see you, sir. Let's just give you a blank slate to begin-- your reaction to the FTC blocking this. Is this what you expected?JOHN FREEMAN: Yes. And I'm surprised that there was-- apparently, it was 3-1. So there was actually a dissenter. I thought that's surprising. I mean, you know, I'm a big fan of the free market, but the law is written such that it says, you know, if you're a monopoly or if you have monopolistic power, you're not allowed to use that power to gain an unfair advantage in an adjacent or potential market. This looks like that would be the case, here. In fact, it's kind of the whole justification for the purchase.So you know, I think Microsoft, too-- I'm trying to-- gave it a good shot. You know, I don't know. They might be able to pull it off. Even now, they might be able to pull it off through appeals. But you know, I don't know. I'm not surprised by the outcome from the FTC perspective.- John, what do you think the odds are that they are going to be able to pull it off through appeals? Because Microsoft still remaining pretty confident. We heard from Activision-Blizzard CEO saying he is confident that this deal is still going to get done.JOHN FREEMAN: Right. Well, the thing is, though, you can't not show confidence. Because then, all kinds of other dominoes fall, and then it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, I think. I don't know. Here's the thing. I think it's possible, but-- I don't know, maybe less than 50/50 possibility, I think.Story continuesThe thing that I look at, though, is should they do it? And I think a $3 billion break-up fee would be a fine thing for Microsoft to do. I want them to focus on the enterprise era. I have a strong buy on Microsoft. I think it's a fantastic company, fantastic stock position for cloud migration, which I think they should focus on and focus their acquisitions there. They can get much better deals now in the enterprise software space, in the cloud space, rather than the video game space, which-- they're a legitimate duopoly. So whatever acquisition they make there, any acquisition they make there is going to get a lot of scrutiny.- Hey, John. I guess, from a gaming fan point of view, it's not really a monopoly when you have Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo sort of dominating the market. If Microsoft can effectively take Activision off the board but then say, hey, we'll get you to give games for 10 years-- you know, I feel like Microsoft's case is not that weak. And also, what if you have a consent decree that allows them to say, hey, Microsoft, you have to let these games go to the competitors for X number of years. Would that make it-- or resolve some of the issues?JOHN FREEMAN: It might. But certainly, I didn't think that they were going to be able to pull this off without concessions. That, I never really thought. They were going to have to make concessions if they wanted to pull it off. And certainly, that Activision user base-- the ""Call of Duty"" user base-- I mean, isn't that-- I understand why they're interested in buying Activision, right? They want that ""Call of Duty"" user base.There are a couple hundred million, you know, real-time, 3-D-- it's basically a narrowly-defined version of what we've been talking as the metaverse. Right? So if they could generalize that with other applications, wow. That would be a fantastic property to own both content, technology, and user base. So I understand why they would want to do it.And at the same time, because it is effectively, I don't know, a duopoly for living room consoles, right? Non-mobile platforms-- they have monopoly-- I think, you know, they have monopolistic power. So they don't have to have an absolute monopoly. At least, that's the interpretation I have been hearing. I'm not a lawyer. But that's what I've been hearing.- Microsoft President Brad Smith saying, ""We've been committed from day one to addressing competition concerns. He elaborated later about where they're going-- ""complete confidence in our case, and we welcome the opportunity present it in court."" John, you mentioned how you feel about Microsoft going forward. What's the investor story and the impact of Activision's side of this?JOHN FREEMAN: Well, here's the thing. I don't think it's that bad an outcome, because Microsoft will have to pay, even if it's blocked. Even if it's a regulatory block, they'll have to pay Activision $3 billion. Well, you know, that's not much for Microsoft. They've got a net cash position of over $50 billion.But it would be really nice for Activision. I mean, it gives them a nice war chest for them to do acquisitions. Activision's always been a good acquirer of studios, [INAUDIBLE] has a real nose for what's up and coming and being able to integrate it with the platform. I don't know. Like, I believe that Activision would be perfectly fine and healthy, even if they don't get bought by Microsoft.- John Freeman. Thank you so much, man.]"

VVNT – have been on cruise control, all climbing more than 10% month-to-date. This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks have displayed remarkable relative strength in December, crushing the S&amp;P 500’s performance.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the strategy returned -4.47% Net of Bundled Fees compared to the Russell 3000 Value Index’s -5.56% return.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a global specialty coffee retailer. On December 6, 2022, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock closed at $102.08 per share. One-month return of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was 10.06% and its shares lost 12.209% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a market capitalization of $117.167 billion.Heartland Advisors made the following comment about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“An example of this focus is Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), a position initiated during the quarter. The coffee giant’s moat is driven by its global scale and brand recognition. Recently, Starbucks grappled with shifting challenges as a result of COVID-19. During the pandemic, demand migrated from Starbucks’ urban locations to overwhelmed suburban stores, as the remote workforce increased, and many remain in a hybrid or work-from-home mode. This, along with stricter COVID-19 lockdowns in China, resulted in margin compression while many of sector peers enjoyed unprecedented margin expansion owing to government stimulus.Starbucks has been investing aggressively to address these inefficiencies. Actions taken include raising wages to reduce turnover, redesigning stores to respond to the rise in mobile ordering, and reengineering equipment to improve barista productivity as more complicated cold beverages now account for more than 50% of total sales.Starbucks also happens to be well-positioned to deal with inflation given the company’s history of pricing power. Over the past year, the company has raised its prices by approximately 5-7%, which is less than the rate of headline inflation. Starbucks likely has room to hike prices further because of the brand recognition and a loyal customer base, as evidenced by more than half of U.S. sales being derived from the Starbucks reward members.”Story continuesStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). ADM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 14.19, which compares to its industry's average of 14.74. Over the last 12 months, ADM's Forward P/E has been as high as 116.19 and as low as 11.67, with a median of 14.41.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. ADM has a P/S ratio of 0.52. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.04.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Archer Daniels Midland's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that ADM is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Dec 16, 2022 $40.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Archer Daniels’ shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Archer Daniels is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Agriculture – Operations industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.40 per share to $1.58 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Archer Daniels right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

With that, I'll turn it over to Aart de Geus.electronics-6055226_1280Story continuesAart de Geus: Good afternoon. I am happy to report that Synopsys completed an outstanding year with sustained forward momentum. Since about four years ago, we communicated our dual objectives of accelerating growth and expanding margin. Synopsys has delivered on and, in fact, exceeded those expectations. This is visible through over 60% revenue growth since that point, 11 percentage points higher non-GAAP operating margin and more than doubled EPS. This quarter, we also crossed the $5 billion annual revenue milestone. Simultaneously, we substantially evolved our product offering, expanded customer relationships and increased competitive differentiation. Building on this, we delivered another record year in fiscal 2022. Revenue grew 21% to $5.08 billion, with double-digit growth in all product groups and across geographies.We further expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 33%, grew earnings by 30% and generated record cash flow of $1.7 billion. While semiconductor industry revenue growth has moderated, design activity remains robust. In addition, our time-based business model, with $7.1 billion of non-cancelable backlog and a diversified customer base, all provide stability, resilience and forward momentum. While fully mindful of the macro dynamics around us, including the most recent US government export restrictions, Synopsys is poised for strong results in fiscal 2023. We intend to grow revenue 14% to 15%, continue to drive notable ops margin expansion and aim for approximately 16% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.Looking at the landscape around us, some of you have asked us why customers design activity remains solid throughout waves of the business cycle. Two reasons. First, the macro quest for Smart Everything devices and with its AI and big data infrastructure is unrelenting and expect it to drive a decade of strong semiconductor growth. Second, semiconductor and systems companies, be it traditional or new entrants, prioritize design engineering throughout economic cycle precisely to be ready to feel competitive new products when the market turns upward again. We've seen this dynamic consistently in past up and down markets and expect it to continue. Today, Synopsys aims to be a key engineering catalyst towards this Smart Everything world as our mission is to enable innovation at the critical interplay between semiconductors and software.Our customers are racing to differentiate along three axes; first, still higher complexity chips with massive compute capability; second, super tightly integrated systems of chips optimized for the software that will run on them; and third, increasing focus on security and safety across both software and hardware in virtually all vertical segments. Synopsys is uniquely positioned to address these challenges as we provide the most advanced and complete design and verification solutions available today, the leading portfolio of highly valuable semiconductor IP blocks and the broader set of software security testing solutions. In the past few years, we have introduced some truly groundbreaking innovations that radically advance how design is done.Let me begin the highlights with our DSO.ai artificial intelligence design solution. With already well-over 100 commercial production design, it continues to deliver amazing results. Applied simultaneously to multiple steps of the design flow, DSO.ai reduces efforts for months to now weeks, while also delivering superior performance and reduced power. Results reported by customers include 25% reduction in turnaround time and compute resources and up to 30% power reduction. With customers such as Samsung, Renesas, Intel, MediaTek, Sony and many others reporting impressive achievements, customer adoptions have accelerated across a wide range of process nodes and market verticals. In FY 2022, the number of customers more than doubled, and we've already seen significant repeat orders and broadening proliferation.Seven out of the top 10 semiconductor companies have adopted DSO.ai for production design. Meanwhile, we're also extending machine learning capabilities across other EDA workloads from verification to test, to custom design. These next phase solutions are already in customers' hands, showing excellent impacts and promise. Central to the impact of DSO.ai are the powerful digital design solution engines underpinning it, specifically our Fusion Compiler products. It drove numerous competitive wins with accelerated proliferation for a wide variety of customers. Key adoptions range from the largest processor firms to influential systems companies, to major hyperscalers. Fusion Compiler is used in over 90% of advanced nodes down to 3 and 2-nanometer, with a majority exclusively using Synopsys.In Q4, cumulative customer tape-outs surpassed 1,000, more than doubling the combined total of FY 2020 and 2021. Our customer solutions also saw strong market momentum this year, continuing the drumbeat of competitive displacements. With options ranging from large semiconductor companies at advanced nodes to automotive to memory vendors, as we added more than 45 new logos this year, nearly one per week with double-digit revenue growth. To address the highly advanced chip mentioned earlier, multi-die system design, sometimes also called chiplet-based design, is opening a whole new era of silicon complexity. Having forecasted this a number of years ago, Synopsys now provides a differentiated multi-die solution that enables architecture, analysis, design, and sign-off all integrated in one place.This includes our 3DIC Compiler solution and our industry-leading portfolio of state-of-the-art die-to-die interface IP. Today, we're already tracking more than 100 multi-die designs for a range of applications, including high-performance compute, data centers, and automotive, seeing strong adoption of our broad solution. A notable example is achieving plan of record for multiple 3D stack designs at a very large, high-performance computing company as well as expanded deployment at a leading mobile customer. Meanwhile, the recently introduced UCIE protocol, short for Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express, has become the interconnect of choice for multi-die systems. Both our UCIE interface IP and HBM3 memory IP are at the forefront of enabling multi-die designs with multiple wins at Tier 1 customers.More broadly, third-party IP is a must-have for designs across the board. Our market-leading IP portfolio, by far the broadest in the industry, continues to drive significant adoption and growth. In fiscal 2022, our IP business delivered another record year with more than 20% growth. We continue to see particularly strong demand in key markets such as high-performance compute, automotive and mobile, where the systems are driven by smart everything, high-speed secure connectivity and advanced process geometries. While maintaining technical leadership in IP for advanced process technologies, we delivered multiple IP products in the most advanced 3- and 4-nanometer process nodes to our customers in high-end mobile and HPC applications. Very strong adoption also of our automotive-grade IP solutions as cars are being re-architected towards both electrification and autonomous driving.The acceleration of car electrification driven by urgent climate considerations notably drives a slew of new sensor, actuator, and control chip designs. Our automotive solutions had outstanding growth. Today, we have engaged with hundreds of designs from more than 30 leading semiconductor providers, more than 10 OEMs, and three of the top four Tier 1 suppliers. At the core of these systems is the intersection of hardware and software. To optimize the system, our customers must verify both the software in the context of the hardware and the hardware in context of the software. While verification is fundamentally an unbounded problem, our state-of-the-art simulation, emulation and prototyping products tackle these tough verification challenges at unparalleled speed with the fastest engine, highest capacity, and lowest cost of ownership.Specifically, our hardware-based products delivered a record year with competitive momentum, adding more than 30 new logos and over 200 repeat orders. Moving now to software security, the critical nature of which continues to grow as management teams and Boards are keenly focused on ways to protect their companies and their customers from destructive cyber attacks. Our Software Integrity solution enables organizations to manage the security and quality of software across a wide range of industry verticals from semiconductor and systems to financial services, automotive, industrial, health and more. Industry groups such as Gartner and Forrester recognized Synopsys leadership. Gartner positions us at the top and farthest right of its Magic Quadrant, rating us highly for technology depth, breadth, consulting capabilities and vision.While this is the one area where we did see some impact from the macro environment in the quarter, revenue growth for the year accelerated over FY 2021. Notably, we saw good progress with the go-to-market and product initiatives introduced last year. Our indirect channel partner business, for example, continues to ramp well by expanding our reach into customer groups and geographies that we haven't connected with in the past. We are building momentum with the goal of another significant increase in indirect sales in FY 2023. On the product side, we expanded our offerings by launching two new SaaS services for static analysis and open source analysis integrated into our Polaris platform. We expect these SaaS capabilities to accelerate adoption and consumption of our solutions as they are particularly well-suited to growth in the mid-market.Early customer reception has been quite positive. Our continually evolving and strengthening platform also provides more and more valuable insights to help companies drive increasingly robust top-down software risk management. In summary, Synopsys exceeded beginning of year targets and delivered a record fiscal 2022 across all metrics with the additional spark of passing the $5 billion milestone. We enter FY 2023 with excellent momentum and a resilient business model that provides stability and wherewithal to navigate market cycles. Notwithstanding, some economic uncertainty, our customers are continuing to prioritize their chip system and software development investments to be ready with differentiated products at the next upturn. On our side, many game changing innovations across our portfolio position as well to capitalize a decade of semiconductor importance and impact.Finally, our execution and operational management continue to drive growth and margin expansion, and we're particularly thankful to our employees around the world for their vitality and diligence throughout the year. One more comment. As you may have seen yesterday, we announced the appointment of Shelagh Glaser to become our new CFO on December 2nd. She's here with us today, listening in as we prepare to pass the torch from Trac in a few days. Before I pass the microphone to Trac for his review of fiscal 2022, it's wonderful to say a heartfelt thank you for his contributions that helped build the company we are today. With 16 years on our team, eight as Synopsys CFO, Trac is a cornerstone architect and execution leader of the strong results of the past year.During his tenure, he strengthened our fiscal discipline and acumen, engineered trusting and effective relationships with the other parts of the company and, most importantly, assembled and grew a great team that we will continue to build on. So it is all the more meaningful to voice our gratitude to Trac at the very moment that we pass this unique revenue milestone. Thank you, Trac. And now one more time, please give us your perspective on the state of Synopsys.See also 10 Best Foreign Stocks To Buy and 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks Under $10.Trac Pham: Thank you Aart for the -- those kind of words. It has been a privilege to serve as the CFO of Synopsys. I'm immensely grateful to be a part of this team, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished. While I'll miss the rich interactions with the Synopsys team and the investment community, I'll be here through the end of December to ensure a smooth transition. Synopsys is in a great position as reflected in strong results and outlook. FY 2022 was an excellent year and featured record results in all key metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP earnings, and operating cash flow. We continue to execute well and are confident in our business heading into FY 2023 driven by our strong technology portfolio that is expanding customer commitments, robust chip and system design activity despite moderating semiconductor industry revenue growth, and a resilient and stable time-based business model with $7.1 billion in non-cash backlog.As a result, while the macro environment is stressed, we expect to grow revenue 14% to 15% and expand operating margin more than 100 basis points, driving non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 16% in 2023. Let me provide some highlights of our full year 2022 results. We generated total revenue of $5.08 billion, up 21% over the prior year, with double-digit growth across all products and key geographies. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $3.9 billion and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $3.4 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 33%. GAAP earnings per share were $6.29 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $8.90, up 30% over the prior year. Semiconductor &amp; System Design segment revenue was $4.6 billion driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies.Adjusted operating margin was 35.3%. Software Integrity segment revenue was $466 million, up 18%, with adjusted operating margin up slightly to 10.1%. For 2023, even in light of some of the marginal macro-related impact in Q4 orders, we expect revenue growth to be within our 15% to 20% objective with increased adjusted operating margin. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was a record $1.7 billion reflecting our strong results, robust collections, and approximately $100 million in early collections. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.57 billion and total debt of $21 million. During the year, we completed buybacks of $1.1 billion or 69% of free cash flow. Now to our targets, which reflects the impact from the recently announced export control regulations and assume no further changes for the year.Based on our current assessment, we expect quarterly revenue and non-GAAP EPS to steadily increase through the year. For fiscal year 2023, the full year targets are; revenue of $5.775 million to $5.825 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $4.49 and $4.537 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.81 billion and $3.84 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin improvement of more than 100 basis points; non-GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP earnings of $10.28 to $10.35 per share, cash flow from operations of approximately $1.7 billion. Now to the targets for the first quarter, revenue between $1.34 billion and $1.37 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $1.033 billion and $1.053 billion, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $875 million and $885 million, GAAP earnings of $1.89 to $2 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $2.48 to $2.53 per share.Our press release and financial supplement include additional targets and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Finally, we are reiterating our long-term financial objectives of annual double-digit revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points per year and non-GAAP EPS growth in the mid-teens range. In conclusion, we entered 2023 with excellent momentum and confidence, reflecting our innovative technology portfolio, ongoing design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor, through semiconductor cycles and the stability and resilience of our time-based business model. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of September 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021 PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

(NYSE:HCA) Suggests It's 48% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-hca-healthcare-inc-130107673.html,1670504467,STORY,['HCA'],"[Does the December share price for HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.10bUS$5.56bUS$6.41bUS$7.02bUS$7.47bUS$7.85bUS$8.18bUS$8.46bUS$8.72bUS$8.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.43%Est @ 5.1%Est @ 4.16%Est @ 3.51%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.73% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$4.7kUS$4.8kUS$5.2kUS$5.3kUS$5.2kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$166bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$166b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$81bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$130b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$238, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at HCA Healthcare as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.986. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For HCA Healthcare, there are three fundamental factors you should look at:Risks: As an example, we've found 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 can't be ignored!) that you need to consider before investing here.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for HCA's future outlook?

Insiders would probably have been better off holding on to their shares given that the average selling price of US$46.78 is still lower than the current share price.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Geographies, Khaled Al Mogharbel, for US$3.2m worth of shares, at about US$54.85 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$49.92. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Schlumberger Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Schlumberger. In total, insiders dumped US$6.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$136m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Schlumberger Tell Us?Insiders sold Schlumberger shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Schlumberger makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - Schlumberger has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Schlumberger (SLB) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.08, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.08 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Schlumberger, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in SLB?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.2% over the past month to $2.15.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Schlumberger.

If you want to see more ETFs in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Energy ETFs in 2022. As per the Economist Intelligence Unit, global energy consumption will increase by only 1.3% in 2023, due to a weakening economy and rampant energy prices. Low gas supplies and extreme weather conditions will push many countries to shift back to fossil fuels, which will defer the green energy transformation. Fitch Ratings has a neutral sector outlook for North American Energy Infrastructure in 2023 despite a slow economic backdrop, and economists expect a mild recession next year. Director Parker Montgomery wrote in a report dated December 6: “The sector largely finances projects with proven technology with newer advances often paired alongside proven technologies or placed in diverse portfolios.”Although the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for immediate delivery has declined nearly 18% since mid-July, energy stocks in the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF have climbed over 32% during the same period. Bespoke Investment Group told Bloomberg on November 29: “As crude prices have declined, they haven’t driven down energy stocks much, which is a surprise given how correlated energy relative performance was with crude until the summer.”This hints at a significant change in how investors are viewing the overall prospects of energy companies. To benefit from the boom in the sector, investors can check out energy ETFs that provide exposure to the top performers in the sector like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD). Our Methodology We selected the following energy ETFs based on positive share price gains year-to-date as of December 7. These exchange traded funds were ranked according to their share price gains. We have discussed these ETFs in terms of their largest holdings, net assets, expense ratios, and benchmark indices.Story continues10 Best Performing Energy ETFs in 2022Photo by Robin Sommer on UnsplashBest Performing Energy ETFs in 202210. Invesco DWA Energy Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PXI)YTD Share Price Gain as of December 7: 37.88%Invesco DWA Energy Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PXI) tracks the performance and investment results of the Dorsey Wright Energy Technical Leaders Index. The ETF invests at least 90% of its total assets in the securities from the benchmark. The ETF and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. Invesco DWA Energy Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PXI) was established in 2006 and offers a total expense ratio of 0.70%. The fund had 33 holdings as of December 6 and the 30-day SEC yield came in at 1.66%. Invesco DWA Energy Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PXI)’s top holding is Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), a company engaged in the land and resource management, water services, and operations businesses. On December 6, Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) declared a $3.00 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 8. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) was part of 20 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 22 in the prior quarter. Murray Stahl’s Horizon Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $2.6 billion. Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) is one of the top energy stocks to monitor. LRT Capital made the following comment about Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) in its October investor letter:“Long time readers will know that we rarely invest in commodity businesses. However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”9. iShares U.S. Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF (NYSE:IEZ)YTD Share Price Gain as of December 7: 43.91% iShares U.S. Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF (NYSE:IEZ) seeks to track the investment results of Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment &amp; Services Index, which is composed of U.S. equities in the oil equipment and services sector.

As a technology leader, Schlumberger should generate strong free cash flow over the next few years as the industry recovers, using its excess cash to gain market share from smaller players and to expand into new areas of growth. Through its scale, presence, partnerships and technology, Schlumberger is targeting expansion into new large addressable markets such as carbon capture, hydrogen, geothermal and lithium extraction.”8.

The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”7.

On November 29, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and QatarEnergy announced an agreement to supply 2 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas per year to Germany for 15 years starting from 2026, as Germany looks to exit its energy relationship with Russia.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 64 hedge funds held long positions in ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) at the end of September 2022, compared to 71 funds in the last quarter.

Its exposure to natural gas helped the stock perform more in line with natural gas E&amp;Ps, which led the sector due to the European energy crisis and U.S. shale gas being considered a secure long-term source of liquid natural gas. In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Energy ETFs in 2022.  Suggested articles:11 Best German Stocks To Invest In10 Cheap Gaming Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Performing Energy ETFs in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Shares have lost about 1.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Perrigo due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Q3 Earnings and Sales Miss EstimatesPerrigo reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents. However, earnings were up 24.4% year over year. Unfavorable currency movements and higher operating expenses hurt earnings in the quarter, which was offset by strategic pricing initiatives undertaken by management. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 44.4%.Net sales increased 5.5% year over year to $1.10 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 12.3%. The upside was driven by sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma, strong demand for cough/cold products globally and higher demand for infant formula in the United States. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and divested Latin American businesses. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 7.7% year over year.Segment DiscussionCSCA: Net sales of the segment in the third quarter of 2022 came in at $722.3 million, up 4% year over year. Sales increased due to strategic price increases, strong demand for store-brand infant formula and new product launches.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $377.9 million, up 8.4% from the year-ago period. At constant-currency rates, sales were up 28.6% year over year. Organically sales increased 8.3%. Segment revenues benefitted from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands, strong demand for cough/cold products and Women’s Health products, partially offset by lower sales of products from the Healthy Lifestyle category. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency movement.Story continues2022 Guidance RevisedPerrigo lowered its earnings guidance for 2022. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.00-$2.10, down from the previous guidance of $2.25-$2.35, to account for the worse-than-previously-expected impact of currency translation.Management reaffirmed total revenues in 2022 to grow 8.5%-9.5%. The company also reiterated its guidance for organic growth between 9-10%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.79% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Perrigo has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Perrigo has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPerrigo belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Another stock from the same industry, Boston Scientific (BSX), has gained 8.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Boston Scientific reported revenues of $3.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $0.43 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Boston Scientific is expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.4%.

(NYSE:AIG) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-american-international-group-103131206.html,1670581891,STORY,['AIG'],"[It looks like American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase American International Group's shares on or after the 14th of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 29th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.32 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.28 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that American International Group has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of $62.26. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether American International Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for American International Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. American International Group paid out just 7.5% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see American International Group has grown its earnings rapidly, up 60% a year for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, nine years ago, American International Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs American International Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Companies like American International Group that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. Overall, American International Group looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.In light of that, while American International Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. We've identified 2 warning signs with American International Group (at least 1 which is potentially serious), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

And a third card notes that the “Royal Family declined to comment within the series.”More from WWDBritain Bids Farewell to Queen Elizabeth IITributes to Queen Elizabeth II on the Runway at London Fashion WeekPictures of London in Mourning for Queen Elizabeth IINaturally. The Windsor credo, after all, is: “Never complain, never explain.”With their hard exit from royal duties — trading paparazzi-prowling old England for the cosseted beauty of sun-kissed Montecito, California — and a $20 million Netflix deal of which this six-episode series about their curdled fairy tale is the centerpiece, Harry and Meghan are doing a lot of complaining, but also a lot of explaining.“Books have been written about our story from people I don’t know,” Markle says to the camera. “Doesn’t it make more sense to hear our story from us?”Perhaps.And the first three episodes sweetly chronicle the couple’s early courtship: their third date was a camping trip in Botswana — in a tent, with no bathroom. But many viewers may feel as if they’ve heard plenty from — and about — Harry and Meghan, such is the all-consuming, clickbait nature of media in the social platform age.There was the explosive sit-down last year with Oprah Winfrey, during which the couple revealed that a nameless palace denizen had questioned how dark their unborn son Archie’s skin might be. Harry has spoken openly about his disdain for the venomous British tabloids that he blames for hounding his mother, Princess Diana, to her death in horrific car crash inside a Paris tunnel in 1997. And since his romance with Markle first became public in 2016, he has admonished the British media for the racist overtones in their coverage of Markle, who is biracial. As he says in the promo for “Harry and Meghan”: “I did not want history to repeat itself.”Story continuesStill to come is Harry’s tell-all memoir, “Spare,” set for a January release. And on Dec. 15, Netflix will drop the final three episodes of “Harry and Meghan.”If six hours feels like a lot of Harry and Meghan, director Liz Garbus (“The Farm,” “Ghosts of Abu Ghraib”) effectively frames the first batch of episodes around the corrosive and toxic British tabloid media, which routinely break the law (phone hacking, breaking and entering, bribery) and the rules of common decency in their pursuit of the royals and other celebrities. The series implies that the House of Windsor’s age-old deal with the media — to grant adequate, sanctioned access in exchange for humane treatment — is woefully anachronistic in the modern era of tabloid journalism, now supercharged by social platforms. And England’s history of colonialism and racial inequality makes for a particularly toxic media stew. As historian and author David Olusoga notes, 3 percent of the British population is Black and a mere 0.2 percent of its journalists are.The hounding of Markle began as soon as her relationship with Harry became public, while she was still a working actress living in Toronto. Markle’s colleagues on the NBC series “Suits” explain that the studio was forced to erect a tall metal fence around the show’s trailers in order to keep paparazzi from sneaking on to the lot, or breaking into Markle’s trailer. Paparazzi offered crew members money for call sheets, so they could catch Markle arriving on set. Her house on a quiet residential street in Toronto was perpetually staked out by a phalanx of photographers waiting in their cars. One photographer paid a neighbor to position a live stream camera into Markle’s back yard. She called the police, who said they could do nothing “because of who you’re dating,” she says.“I would say to the police: If any other woman in Toronto said to you, ‘I have six grown men who are sleeping in their cars around my house and following me everywhere I go, and I feel scared,’ wouldn’t you say that was stalking?”But when she received a death threat, the studio hired security for her. Markle’s mother, Doria Ragland, who has consented to few interviews, appears in the second and third episodes. She says that when Markle was a baby, strangers mistook her for the nanny instead of her mother because Markle’s skin was much lighter. She recalls warning her daughter, whom she calls Meg, that “this is about race.”“You may not want to hear it,” Ragland says she told her daughter, “But this is what’s coming down the pike.”For Markle, it was a shock. “It’s very different to be a minority and not be treated like a minority right off the bat,” she says in the second episode. Before the notoriety that came with being Harry’s girlfriend and then wife, she continues, “most people didn’t treat me as a Black woman.”Harry says Markle’s treatment was viewed inside the royal system as a “rite of passage.”“As far as the family were concerned, everything that she was being put through, they had been put through as well. And for some members of the family it was like, right, well, my wife had to go through that, why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment?”That Markle’s treatment was different because of its overly racist tenor fell on deaf ears, he says.Garbus effectively juxtaposes Markle’s experience with familiar images of Diana attempting to evade the paparazzi; fleeing in her Mercedes convertible, shielding her face with a Prince tennis racket. There were times when she attempted to reason with them, including a memorable video during a ski vacation with William and Harry. And there are so many shots of Diana staring coldly into their cameras from a distance. Video of a press avail outside the hospital when Harry was merely hours old is particularly poignant: there’s Diana in a bright red muumuu, her outlandishly feathered hair rendered immovable by hair spray, her makeup thick and perfect.We also know that Diana used the tabloids when she could. Her disastrous 1995 BBC interview with Martin Bashir ultimately led to the dissolution of her marriage. The interview spurred a recent investigation and an apology from the BBC for Bashir’s deception in garnering the sit-down. And Harry and Meghan are involved in ongoing legal action against multiple Britain outlets.And watching this series, which distills the hounding endured by his mother and wife, one can understand why. With their exit from royal duties, Harry and Meghan have decided to no longer suffer in silence, though their detractors clearly wish they would.Harry allows that “the majority” of his childhood memories with his mother involve “being swarmed by paparazzi.”“Rarely did we have a holiday without someone with a camera jumping out of the bush, or something,” he adds. “We all now know that she was deceived into giving the interview but at the same time, she spoke the truth about her experience.”Harry has always been more honest about that particular episode than has William. Perhaps it’s because he is third in line to the throne and is unlikely to get the top job, or perhaps it is because, as he says, “I am my mother’s son.”If there is one moment from “Harry &amp; Meghan” that crystalizes the messy, interdependent relationship between the monarchy and the media — and elucidates Harry’s motivations for fleeing a system that prioritizes duty above all else — it is a video shortly after the death of Diana. Harry, 12, and William, 15, together with their father, walk amid a sea of bouquets outside Kensington Palace while photographers snap pictures. Their mother’s death is one more media spectacle. Young boys, suddenly motherless, dutifully shake hands and comfort weeping mourners.]"

Even without any intercontinental ballistic missiles launched, this production was never going to be a low-key affair.Story continuesWhile some media outlets offered a blow-by-blow of the events unfurling on screen, others took aim at Harry, Meghan and the documentary itself, which drops at a difficult time in the U.K., amid a cost-of-living crisis; new strike action announced nearly every day, and working people unable to heat their homes.The Sun jumped in early with its critique, splashing a headline on its homepage that read, “Netfibs: Five times Meghan Markle and Harry appear to change their story in Netflix documentary.”The paper spotted what it believes are inconsistencies in the couple’s stories about their first date; the details of Harry’s marriage proposal, and how often Meghan wore bright colors when she was a working royal.The Times of London rated the show two stars out of five, with TV critic and columnist Carol Midgley saying it had “plenty of cheesy moments and few surprises.” She described episode one as a “saccharine tsunami” and an exercise in “cloth-eared self-indulgence.”Midgley said that if Netflix was hoping the show “would have the jaw-drop effect of previous ‘royal bombshell’ TV events, specifically Princess Diana’s Panorama interview, judging by ‘Volume 1,’ it will be disappointed. They gave so much of their ‘stuff’ away in their Oprah interview. It felt anti-climactic, a bit of a Christmas turkey.”Sarah Vine, writing in The Daily Mail, described the show as “over-the-top and manipulative,” but was quick to add that it shows just how much Harry loves Meghan.“In Meghan he has found his peace, a version of the mother he lost at such a tender age, his protector, the only person — as he sees it — who ever really understood him. She’s his second chance at happiness, and he’s not going to blow it,” wrote Vine.“That’s why [Meghan] can do no wrong. That’s why he will always side with her against his family, even if she’s being a total diva. And that is why the palace now needs to start taking the Harry and Meghan problem very seriously indeed,” added Vine.Camilla Tominey, associate editor at The Telegraph, agreed that Harry is “besotted by his wife,” but believes that he has lost touch with reality. The title of her article was “Harry, Meghan and the Half-Truth Prince: An Unashamedly One-Sided Story.”Tominey went on to describe the documentary as a “subtle form of television warfare. Like a love story featuring an arrow filled with explosives. It used slick propaganda, thinly veiled jibes and a Sussex squad of loyal troops to do battle against bigoted Britain and its racist press.”This is not the end.There will be more headlines to come on Friday — a furor is already brewing here about how Netflix communicated with Buckingham Palace as the documentary was being filmed, and whether it gave the royal family a chance to respond in a timely manner.Next week, a second three-hour episode should generate even more digital ink and Netflix downloads. Then, of course, there’s Harry’s book, “Spare,” which is due to be published on Jan. 10.In between, King Charles will make his first Christmas address as monarch in a brief, pre-recorded speech to the British public.It could give him an opportunity to respond to the controversy in a subtle way, such as the arrangement of the family pictures around him, or in comments about the challenges of 2022.The British media and public will be paying close attention. ]"

Because there was nothing 'bombshell' or even very new here. It was beautifully shot but it was repetitive, whingy and boring,"" Carol Midgley wrote from The Times in Britain.Stephanie Bunbury of U.S. online news site Deadline said that the series failed to add any new insight into the most pressing questions from fans.""Three hours into Netflix doc series Harry &amp; Meghan and still no tell-all truths from the darkest corners of the House of Windsor,"" Bunbury wrote.Other critics found it a satisfying glimpse into the private lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.""Does Meghan and Harry's Netflix documentary live up to its no-holds-barred expectations?,"" wrote Jessie Thompson from British newspaper The Independent. ""Well, within the first five minutes we've seen a makeup-less Meghan, hair wrapped in a towel, crying into her phone camera – so I'm going to say yes.”Story continuesOn Rotten Tomatoes, the audience ratings were negative. Out of 248 reviews, the average score was 1.3 out of 5 on Thursday.In London, commuters were divided as to whether they would tune in.Finance manager Nadia Tunar said she thought the couple ""just want attention"", and salon manager Sarah Barnsbury said she was not going to watch it.""It's just not for me,"" Barnsbury said.Sharon Brown, a 52-year-old security officer, said on the other hand that it was about time the royals ""actually got a voice to say what they need to say"".Customer support assistant Carmel Williams, 33, said she would like to know what has been happening and how the couple are feeling, calling it ""gossip behind the scenes"".Paul Driscoll, 52, head of IT for a private equity business, said: ""I'll probably watch it because we all watch them, right?""He added: ""They're welcome to do whatever they want to do, but I'm not really sure it's the right time for them to do it.""

The hike in spending comes despite a reduction in the production target for 2023 by 100,000 barrels of equivalent oil per day (boed) to 2.6 million boed.The Brazilian state-owned oil major also sanctioned additional short-term drilling for existing projects above its long-term break-even of $35 per barrel.

That would be some 4.5 percentage points below the year's peak in March.At least the numbers are expected to be reliable. Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Friday it was cancelling next week's producer price report after discovering further potential problems with the calculation of the series dogged by errors in diesel and food prices.The disinflation theme more generally has been encouraged by the plunge in Brent crude oil prices this week to their lowest of the year below $76 per barrel, although a major leak lifted U.S. prices marginally on Friday.Canada's TC Energy shut its Keystone pipeline in the United States after more than 14,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into a creek in Kansas, making it one of the largest crude spills in the United States in nearly a decade.Hopes for a China economic reboot, however, lifted London copper prices, which rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday to hit their highest in more than five months.Story continuesU.S. stock futures were marginally higher ahead of Wall Street's open after the S&amp;P500 broke a 5-day losing streak on Thursday. U.S. Treasury yields were steady after rebounding from 3-month lows yesterday. The dollar was a touch lower.Elsewhere, Britain's finance ministry on Friday set out plans to overhaul the financial sector, including a review of rules to make bankers accountable for their decisions and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders.Credit Suisse stock rose another 3% after it hailed on Thursday a ""milestone"" in its turnaround plan after raising 2.24 billion Swiss francs ($2.39 billion) as part of a 4 billion franc fund raising. Shareholders exercised 98.4% of their subscription rights, giving a boost to managers tasked with getting the Swiss bank back on track after the biggest crisis in its 166-year history.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* U.S. Nov producer prices, University of Michigan's Dec consumer sentiment* U.S. Federal Reserve issues quarterly financial accounts of the United States* U.S. corporate earnings: Oracle Graphic: China's negative PPI, slowing CPI growth in Nov, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/xmvjkkgmqpr/chart.png Graphic: Jobless claims, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klpyggemlpg/joblessclaims2.png Graphic: Heading the wrong direction? https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/znvnbbdqyvl/chart.png(By Mike Dolan, editing by Jane Merriman mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

It did not say when the review would be completed.The plan focuses on expanding the critical minerals sector and ""moving things forward expeditiously,"" Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said at a news conference in Vancouver.Wilkinson said the strategy, backed by nearly C$4 billion ($2.95 billion) allocated in the 2022 budget, ""is a roadmap for the creation of wealth and sustainable jobs throughout the value chain in every region of this country.""Under the strategy, companies will be offered help in applying for permits and for federal support through the Critical Minerals Centre of Excellence. The office is already operating with a team of about 15 people, said a senior government source.Critical minerals are key elements in EV batteries, electronics and solar panels and play a crucial role in the transition to the green economy. While Canada is home of some the largest deposits of critical minerals, it can take anywhere between five and 25 years for a mining project to become operational, the document said.""We recognize that, although responsible regulations are vital, complex regulatory and permitting processes can hinder the economic competitiveness of the sector and increase investment risk for proponents,"" the document reads.As the world shifts to cleaner technologies, demand for critical minerals is expected to skyrocket. Many in the mining industry have said the bureaucracy is too slow and is holding up investment.Story continues""What has been the tendency over many years is that the requirements just keep ballooning and you end up with impact assessment reports (for new mines) that are thousands of pages long,"" said Pierre Gratton, president and chief executive of the Mining Association of Canada, adding that he welcomed a review of the permitting process.""We're not looking for yet another overhaul of the federal regime. We're looking at opportunities to implement existing requirements more expeditiously. ... There are definitely opportunities to speed things up,"" he said.China dominates the market for critical minerals used in EV batteries.Countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan want to wean themselves from their dependence on authoritarian regimes for strategically important materials.'EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE OF CANADA'Canada signed a joint action plan with the United States in 2020 to advance secure supply chains for critical minerals. It has signed similar critical minerals cooperation agreements with Japan and the European Union.""I've talked to the Americans more in the last few years than I had ever talked to them in my entire career, and also Europeans,"" Gratton said. ""Everyone wants a piece of Canada right now, and they keep knocking on our door.""The new strategy lays out priorities along the entire critical-mineral value chain, from exploration and mining to recycling old batteries, and it also covers the need for new infrastructure in often remote corners of the country.Ottawa will seek ""regulatory harmonization"" with the United States on critical minerals, the document reads without elaborating.Ottawa's strategy prioritizes developing lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements. At the same time, Canada is offering a 30% tax credit to spur exploration for nickel, lithium, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium and uranium.($1 = 1.3579 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Steve Scherer; Additional reporting by Ismail Shaki; Editing by Stephen Coates, Crispian Balmer and Richard Chang)]"

Anglo estimates it will produce around 300,000 tonnes a year for the first 10 years.The company also forecast a 3% drop in overall output this calendar year as the Quellaveco ramp-up and strong diamond output only partly made up for the lower output elsewhere. It said production should grow about 5% in 2023 from 2022 levels.Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad told investors the company's focus in 2022 has been to restore normal operations after the COVID-19 related disruptions, which added to worries over global economic volatility, extreme weather and other local disruptions to operations.Anglo mines copper, nickel, platinum group metals and iron ore, which are used to make electric batteries or renewable power infrastructure or food preservation technologies.Wanblad said while the demand for metals and minerals would be strong in the long term, there are chances of ""structural shortage"" to meet the energy transition demands.After returning record dividends to shareholders thanks to strong commodity prices in 2021, Anglo in July cut payouts on higher costs and lower production.High inflation, the prospect of a global recession and doubts about demand in China, the world's biggest user of raw materials, could hit earnings for Anglo and its peers as costs rise.Story continuesThe company expects to spend $5 billion to $6.5 billion annually for the next three years and grow output until 2024, after which it predicted some levelling in 2025.Anglo also said that developing the Woodsmith fertiliser nutrients deposit in Britain's North York Moors National Park, would require an investment of $500 million in 2022 and $800 million next year.(Reporting by Clara Denina, Helen Reid, Pushkala Aripaka; Editing by Rashmi Aich, Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Arun Koyyur)]"

That would be some 4.5 percentage points below the year's peak in March.At least the numbers are expected to be reliable. Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Friday it was cancelling next week's producer price report after discovering further potential problems with the calculation of the series dogged by errors in diesel and food prices.The disinflation theme more generally has been encouraged by the plunge in Brent crude oil prices this week to their lowest of the year below $76 per barrel, although a major leak lifted U.S. prices marginally on Friday.Canada's TC Energy shut its Keystone pipeline in the United States after more than 14,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into a creek in Kansas, making it one of the largest crude spills in the United States in nearly a decade.Hopes for a China economic reboot, however, lifted London copper prices, which rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday to hit their highest in more than five months.Story continuesU.S. stock futures were marginally higher ahead of Wall Street's open after the S&amp;P500 broke a 5-day losing streak on Thursday. U.S. Treasury yields were steady after rebounding from 3-month lows yesterday. The dollar was a touch lower.Elsewhere, Britain's finance ministry on Friday set out plans to overhaul the financial sector, including a review of rules to make bankers accountable for their decisions and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders.Credit Suisse stock rose another 3% after it hailed on Thursday a ""milestone"" in its turnaround plan after raising 2.24 billion Swiss francs ($2.39 billion) as part of a 4 billion franc fund raising. Shareholders exercised 98.4% of their subscription rights, giving a boost to managers tasked with getting the Swiss bank back on track after the biggest crisis in its 166-year history.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* U.S. Nov producer prices, University of Michigan's Dec consumer sentiment* U.S. Federal Reserve issues quarterly financial accounts of the United States* U.S. corporate earnings: Oracle Graphic: China's negative PPI, slowing CPI growth in Nov, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/xmvjkkgmqpr/chart.png Graphic: Jobless claims, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klpyggemlpg/joblessclaims2.png Graphic: Heading the wrong direction? https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/znvnbbdqyvl/chart.png(By Mike Dolan, editing by Jane Merriman mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

For more countries, head on over to Top 5 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World. Semiconductor fabrication is one of the most lucrative yet one of the most difficult industries in the world. Chips are responsible for powering the information-driven, modern day economy. However, manufacturing them comes after decades have been spent on research and development and billions of dollars have been spent in capital expenditure to procure the right equipment. Sometimes, even this is not enough as chip manufacturers, also called fabs, are only a single player in a vast supporting ecosystem that ranges from the equipment needed to prepare and transform silicon into the wafers for fabrication to the actual testing of the chips once they have been 'printed' inside expensive machines.Therefore, chip production is concentrated in geographic pockets, with some countries having an edge over others since the supporting foundry ecosystem enables companies to set up facilities there much more easily. An example is the U.S. state of Arizona, which is known for hosting chipzilla Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s foundries and subsequently has a strong ecosystem that consists not only of companies that provide the necessary raw materials, but also universities that tailor their programs to meet Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s needs and ensure that it has a steady stream of engineers ready to build chips. The strength of the Arizonian ecosystem has also enticed the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) to build its new American chipmaking plant in the state as well, after scouting for multiple locations.As an estimate of the investment required to keep the foundries and ecosystem running, a brief look at the capital expenditure of the industry is relevant. According to the research firm IC Insights, worldwide semiconductor spending will sit at a whopping $185.5 billion next year. The spending has grown exponentially in just four decades, as in 1980 it had stood at a mere $14.7 billion.Story continuesMoving towards units shipped, coverage from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) shows that by the end of 2021, global semiconductor sales had stood at a stunning $555 billion, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.18% since 2001. The U.S. continued to dominate the market, as it held 46% of the overall pie, with South Korea coming in at second place with a 21% share and Japan and the European Union in third place with 9% market shares, each. Crucially, U.S. firms had also commanded half of the Chinese market, which was the largest in the world with and worth $192.4 billion. However, while American companies were the worldwide chip leaders, the Americas market is the third largest in the world and was valued at $121.5 billion last year.Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the WorldDragon Images/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We looked through the major semiconductor foundries all over the world and determined the countries (or special regions such as Taiwan) in which they are operating in. The regions are then ranked according to the number of fabs that are present in them, and the list is not exhaustive and it also includes plants that are under construction. Also, do check out 16 Largest Semiconductor Companies by Market Cap if you want to know about the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Some of the companies on that list include Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).Top 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World10. State of Israel Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4, 2022: 4 The State of Israel is a Western Asian country that is also one of the most advanced nations in the world. Despite a population of a mere 9.6 million people, the country's economy is worth $497 billion which lends it a high GDP per capita of $52,173. Israel also boasts one of the largest startup ecosystems in the world and has the most NASDAQ listed companies after the U.S. and China as of 2016, indicating the strength of its business ecosystem. Additionally, the country also runs a current account surplus as of 2019, leaving it with little need to be dependent on foreign capital to fund its economy through loans.Owing to the fact that it is an economic and technology hub, the State of Israel also has four semiconductor foundries. Two of these belong to the U.S. chipmaking giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and two below to Tower Semiconductor, but with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) being in the process of acquiring the Israeli chipmaker, soon all the chipmaking facilities in the country will come under chipzilla's umbrella.9. Netherlands Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4, 2022: 4The Netherlands is a European country that is the largest constituent of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is one of the most liberal countries on Earth, and also one of the most densely populated regions as more than 500 people live in each square kilometer of the country. The country's GDP stood at a whopping $1.2 trillion in purchasing power parity terms this year, lending it a high GDP per capita of $69,715. The Netherlands is a net exporter and has a large current account surplus, which lends it credibility with global financial markets and lets it borrow trillions of dollars to fuel its growth and keep its credit outlook stable at the same time.Some of the largest multinational firms in the world are also located in the country, and one of the most crucial firms headquartered there is ASML. ASML, like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), is one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world. ASML is the only company in the world that is capable of manufacturing high end machines that print semiconductors. The chip industry's progress depends on these machines, and therefore they are always in high demand, even when the industry is facing a downturn as chipmakers are continuously planning for the future. Additionally, the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange is the oldest exchange in the world, since it was set up centuries ago in 1602. Chip manufacturing plants in the Netherlands belong to NXP and Philips, among others.8. Malaysia Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4, 2022: 7 Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country that gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 and then united with three other colonies, including Singapore, to become Malaysia in 1963. However, Singapore was expelled from the union in 1967, with economic and political disagreements and racial tensions fueling the decision to prevent bloodshed. Malaysia's GDP is estimated to be worth more than a trillion dollars, and the country also runs a current account surplus. Malaysia exports semiconductors and natural resources, among other products.Seven chipmaking plants are located in the country, with four belonging to the German firms Infineon and Osram Licht. Another belongs to a Belgian firm and two belong to Malaysian entities.7. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4, 2022: 12 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European country, which when combined with Ireland, is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. It has a unique and distinct history, which has seen it not only rule the world but have deep ties to the Roman Empire via its City of London financial hub which is part of Greater London. The U.K. has also pioneered many modern day inventions such as the automobile and the jet engine.The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is home to one of the most consequential semiconductor designers, Arm Ltd. Arm's products are at the heart of most of the world's smartphones and its designs are also used in data center chips. Chip fabrication facilities in the country are owned by Dutch and American firms, among others.6. Republic of Korea (ROK) Number of Operational and Planned Fabs December 4, 2022: 15The Republic of Korea (ROK), also known as South Korea, is an East Asian country that became a republic in 1949. The country is one of the most prosperous nations in the world, with a $2.7 trillion GDP and a GDP per capita of $53,051. South Korea's exports stood at $644 billion in 2021, out of which integrated circuits, or semiconductors, formed the largest chunk as they accounted for more than 15% of the overall pie.The strength of its chip exports is unsurprising as some of the largest chip companies are located in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The country is home to two of the world's three largest memory manufacturers - SK Hynix and Samsung. The pair collectively controlled roughly two thirds of the global memory market as of September 2022. Samsung's chipmaking divisions are also responsible for manufacturing semiconductors for other companies, and Samsung Foundry is only of two companies in the world (the other being TSMC) that make chips for others with leading edge process technologies such as 5-nanometer and now 3-nanometer. Out of the 15 chipmaking fabs in South Korea, eight are owned by Samsung which also makes processors and graphics processing units (GPUs) for its own smartphone lineup. These are used in international variants of the devices that are sold outside the United States due to an agreement with the U.S. chip giant QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).As the demand for semiconductors grow around the world, companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are set to experience record profits in the long term.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +7.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.21 points to a change of -18.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.31 indicates a change of +20.6% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Qualcomm.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -10.2%. The $40.13 billion and $45.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -9.2% and +14.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $11.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $3.13 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Details of the anti-drone and air defense equipment included could not be determined.The Pentagon is also expected to include rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp, 155mm ammunition, Humvee military vehicles and generators, according to the people and the document.A National Security Council spokesperson declined to comment on the aid package. The contents and size of aid packages can shift until they are signed by the president.The $275 million will be covered by Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which allows the United States to transfer defense articles and services from stocks quickly without congressional approval in response to an emergency.Russia's surge in missile strikes in Ukraine is partly designed to exhaust Kyiv's supplies of air defenses and achieve dominance of the skies above the country, a senior Pentagon official said in November.To counter these attacks, the United States has sent sophisticated anti-aircraft NASAMS systems to Ukraine which have been running for a few weeks.Washington previously announced it was sending four Avenger short-range air defense systems that use Stinger missiles, made by Raytheon Technologies Corp, and HAWK interceptor missiles.U.S. allies have also been sending air defense systems.Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", the United States has sent around $19.1 billion worth of security assistance to Kyiv.U.S. lawmakers voted on Thursday to provide Ukraine at least $800 million in additional security assistance next year.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $1.36 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 5, 2031. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on FLRAAThe aforementioned contract is based on Bell’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor, which was developed and tested as part of the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR TD) program that began in 2013. The V-280 progressed through design, manufacturing, and more than three years of rigorous flight testing that provided extensive data validating the technical and operational advantages of the aircraft for long-range assault missions.The initial contract refines the FLRAA weapon system design, sustainment, digital enterprise, manufacturing, systems integration, flight-testing and airworthiness qualification.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have also been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe bumped-up defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunition of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to expand at a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This is likely to benefit Textron, with its Bell segment consistently innovating combat helicopters as well as upgrading the existing models to expand in the military rotorcraft market. In March 2022, Bell submitted its final Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) proposal revision to the U.S. Army and expects to receive the contract in October 2022.Story continuesThe growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft to U.S. armed forces along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations. Some of its product ranges include CH-53K, S-92, UH-60 Black Hawk, etc.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.2%. LMT shares have risen 41.1% in the past year.Boeing’s portfolio of helicopters comprises the AH-6 Little Bird, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey and H-47 Chinook aircraft and in-development entrants, which include the MH-139A Grey Wolf and DEFIANT X. Its military rotorcraft is currently used by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as allied defense forces in over 20 countries across the globe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2022 earnings implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure. BA’s shares have moved up 11.8% in the past three months.Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout is a combat-proven, autonomous helicopter system providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target-acquisition, laser designation and battle management for tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. It’s available in two variants – MQ-8B Fire Scout and MQ-8C Fire Scout.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.

153,836ae6a4-f3a4-34a3-970a-04face6aa528,BAX,2022-12-09,An Intrinsic Calculation For Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) Suggests It's 30% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-baxter-international-inc-174141502.html,1670521301,STORY,['BAX'],"[How far off is Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Baxter International Is Baxter International Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.10bUS$2.45bUS$2.87bUS$2.83bUS$2.82bUS$2.83bUS$2.85bUS$2.88bUS$2.92bUS$2.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.33%Est @ 0.36%Est @ 0.85%Est @ 1.19%Est @ 1.42%Est @ 1.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$1.9kUS$2.1kUS$2.2kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.0%) = US$46bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$46b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$20bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$38b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$52.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Baxter International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.184. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group The CalculationWe have to calculate the value of WEC Energy Group slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%. Relative to the current share price of US$95.7, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$3.2 / (6.4% – 2.0%)= US$72.0dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at WEC Energy Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.

We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Story continuesMoving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

That single transaction was for US$737k worth of shares at a price of US$102 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:21% = US$1.6b ÷ US$7.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.Does Crown Castle Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Crown Castle has a better ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Crown Castle.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCrown Castle's Debt And Its 21% ROECrown Castle clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.77. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Republic Services How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Republic Services is:15% = US$1.5b ÷ US$9.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.15 in profit.Does Republic Services Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Republic Services has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesRepublic Services' Debt And Its 15% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Republic Services, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.21. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Republic Services may not be the best stock to buy.

162,d9044b80-4cce-3eab-8b6b-b52a46da1ee3,MRK,2022-12-09,Here's What We Like About Merck's (NYSE:MRK) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-mercks-nyse-mrk-upcoming-113641113.html,1670585801,STORY,['MRK'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Merck investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of January.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.73 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.92 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Merck has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current stock price of $110.85. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Merck has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Merck If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Merck paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 45% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Merck's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 34% per annum for the past five years. Merck is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Merck has lifted its dividend by approximately 5.7% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Merck? Merck has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - Merck has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

163,2318760d-5fb4-3b50-9d8a-3fd03d2d500a,MOS,2022-12-09,Institutional owners may ignore The Mosaic Company's (NYSE:MOS) recent US$715m market cap decline as longer-term profits stay in the green,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-ignore-mosaic-104812125.html,1670582892,STORY,['MOS'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$16b last week. However, the 33% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mosaic. View our latest analysis for Mosaic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mosaic?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Mosaic already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Mosaic's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Mosaic is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 6.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MosaicThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Mosaic Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$58m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Mosaic. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mosaic   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

While the factory of the early days involved workers, now, companies rely on automated processes to make machines do their bidding. Automation is not limited only to manufacturing operations. Instead, it has also spread to power generation and even healthcare, with robots and timed delivery systems reducing the workload on doctors, surgeons, and nurses.Therefore, it's no surprise that the automation industry itself is worth billions of dollars. A research report from Acumen Research and Consulting outlines that the industry was worth $189.7 billion last year and from the end of this year to 2030, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7% to sit at $430.9 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm notes that a variety of different factors such as real time data for preventive analytics, robotic processes, intra company linkages through enterprise resource planning systems, and the growth in machine learning and big data analytics will drive the industry forward. Several different industries rely on automation these days, such as aerospace and defense, energy, pharmaceuticals, and automobile manufacturing. Asia Pacific is the largest automation market in the world, particularly since China's role as the world's manufacturing hub requires companies such as Foxconn to bring robots to their aid.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the industrial automation market was worth $191.89 billion. It will grow to $205.86 billion by the end of this year, and from then until 2030, continue growing at a 9.8% CAGR for a final value of $395 billion. The firm adds that there is pent up growth in the industry due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic that stalled manufacturing, and at the same time, COVID also spurred the adoption of industrial automation due to the reduced need for social distance measures. Robots, after all, do not catch the coronavirus. However, Fortune Business Insights disagrees with Acumen Research when it comes to the largest industrial automation market. According to this research firm, Europe held the largest share of the pie in 2021, with an estimated market value of $61.85 billion. IoT and augmented reality will drive automation; however, a key hindrance will be large capital expenditures.Story continuesToday's piece will focus on the largest automation companies that either operate in or provide their services in the United States.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $1.36 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 5, 2031. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on FLRAAThe aforementioned contract is based on Bell’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor, which was developed and tested as part of the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR TD) program that began in 2013. The V-280 progressed through design, manufacturing, and more than three years of rigorous flight testing that provided extensive data validating the technical and operational advantages of the aircraft for long-range assault missions.The initial contract refines the FLRAA weapon system design, sustainment, digital enterprise, manufacturing, systems integration, flight-testing and airworthiness qualification.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have also been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe bumped-up defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunition of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to expand at a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This is likely to benefit Textron, with its Bell segment consistently innovating combat helicopters as well as upgrading the existing models to expand in the military rotorcraft market. In March 2022, Bell submitted its final Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) proposal revision to the U.S. Army and expects to receive the contract in October 2022.Story continuesThe growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft to U.S. armed forces along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations. Some of its product ranges include CH-53K, S-92, UH-60 Black Hawk, etc.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.2%. LMT shares have risen 41.1% in the past year.Boeing’s portfolio of helicopters comprises the AH-6 Little Bird, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey and H-47 Chinook aircraft and in-development entrants, which include the MH-139A Grey Wolf and DEFIANT X. Its military rotorcraft is currently used by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as allied defense forces in over 20 countries across the globe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2022 earnings implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure.

173,210cab73-f7fc-3a5a-a5e9-3474085ab2ae,ILMN,2022-12-09,The Next Frontier in Carbon Capture Is a Hungry Bacterium,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-frontier-carbon-capture-hungry-175000044.html,1670521800,STORY,['ILMN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 8, 2022 / Emissions from industrial plants worldwide have been driving global warming for decades. Waste and gases from facilities like steel mills are rich in carbon and constitute about 21% of humanity's carbon footprint. Biologists Sean Simpson and the late Richard Foster had an idea in 2005: Instead of causing harm, could these emissions be used for good?That question led them to found LanzaTech, a biotechnology company based in Illinois, with the goal of turning carbon emissions into valuable material commodities.Bacteria make that goal possible. Primitive microbes, or those found in extreme environments such as hydrothermal vents in the deep sea, have been converting carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuel for billions of years. Simpson and Foster first took a collection of microbes that were known to do this and began feeding them gases from a steel mill. In that initial screening and discovery stage, they found that an anaerobic bacterium called Clostridium autoethanogenum possessed an ancient pathway that could ferment both CO and CO2, effectively converting it into ethanol under the right conditions. Ethanol, in turn, can be made into polyester fabrics, aviation fuel, and-of course-alcohol.To efficiently feed these gases to the microbes, LanzaTech developed and scaled novel bioreactors-large vessels where bacteria, liquid media, and gases are mixed and come together so the bacteria can consume the carbon in the gases, grow, and make products. They also developed a synthetic biology toolbox, including automated workflows and CRISPR gene editing tools, to improve the efficiency of the process and expand the range of products these microbes can make. Early in the company's development, they invested in the Illumina MiSeq and later the NextSeq 1000, which have been instrumental in helping the company track genome edits in their strains and identify genes in plants, bacteria, and other life-forms that can convert carbon into useful chemicals-genes that could be introduced into C. autoethanogenum, says Michael Köpke, the company's vice president of synthetic biology.Story continuesIllumina's technologies helped LanzaTech to genetically modify C. autoethanogenum to synthesize acetone-an important solvent and chemical building block-from industrial emissions. Today, acetone is made exclusively petrochemically from fresh fossil fuels, but in the early 1900s it was produced by fermentation from sugars into a mixture of acetone, butanol, and ethanol. Due to substrate cost and low selectivity, the process was eventually abandoned over the course of the last century, but the strains were preserved and LanzaTech used that collection as a starting point.""The initial hope was that some of these strains would also be able to utilize the gases we work with,"" Köpke says. ""Unfortunately, that was not the case and the collection of microbes was sitting in the corner for several years. Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology allowed us to revisit the collection."" Illumina's sequencing technology helped LanzaTech identify the microbial genes responsible for making acetone, and with those sequences in hand, their researchers synthesized and transferred them into their organism. Acetone is used as a solvent for cosmetics, paints, electronics, and consumer products, and can be used in manufacturing acrylic glass-in which case, the formerly atmospheric carbon is locked away practically forever in a stable, solid form. ""You can achieve not only carbon neutrality, but actual carbon-negative production,"" says Köpke.Currently, LanzaTech has three operational commercial units in China (which started up in 2018, 2021, and 2022), and two more coming online soon in India and Belgium. Since they came online, the facilities in China have produced over 50 million gallons of ethanol from industrial emissions, which is the equivalent of keeping over 200,000 tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere.The company has 12 more units planned, which together would prevent 1 million tons of CO2 from being released and expand their production capacity to around 700,000 tons of useful chemicals each year. And it's no longer just ethanol and acetone: LanzaTech has demonstrated the ability to convert industrial waste into over 100 different chemicals. ""We're working on optimizing the efficiency for those and then bringing them to scale into markets over the next couple of years,"" Köpke says.The resulting chemicals have a range of applications across industries; for instance, the ethanol LanzaTech produces has been used to make polyester for fashion brands Zara and Lululemon, and packaging for L'Oréal.""It's really exciting to see the impact we're already having,"" Köpke says. ""Eventually [we] want to give every consumer an opportunity to get a sustainable version of everything that you find today.""Illumina, Thursday, December 8, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730953/The-Next-Frontier-in-Carbon-Capture-Is-a-Hungry-Bacterium]"

176,b2df5628-43d0-3675-b267-d2804d2c6885,MAA,2022-12-09,3 REITs That Could Help Your Portfolio Weather a Recession,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-could-help-portfolio-143202267.html,1670509922,STORY,"['VICI', 'MAA-PI', 'REG']","[Inflation concerns are refusing to abate and experts fear that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflationary pressure through rate hikes might push the economy toward a recession.A moderation in Consumer Price Index readings and an indication from the Fed about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December came as a relief. However, the recent employment report exhibited a strong labor market as well as higher-than-expected wage growth, suggesting that the inflation fight by the Fed might be tougher.Dividend-Paying Stocks Gain FocusAmid these uncertainties and increased volatility, the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Particularly, REITs like VICI Properties Inc. VICI, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Regency Centers Corporation REG look poised to not only deliver better results but also reward shareholders simultaneously.Why REITs?According to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker®) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs’ operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations (FFO) and net operating income (NOI), respectively.With REITs continuing to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now if REITs’ historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, then it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Per the third-quarter 2022 NAREIT report, leverage ratios remained near historic lows, with debt-to-market assets at 34.5%, while interest coverage increased to six times. Moreover, net interest expense as a percent of NOI was near its historical low at 18.9%. Also, REITs have extended the maturity of their debt with the weighted average term to maturity of REIT debt now being more than seven years, or 84 months. As such, REITs remain well-positioned for ongoing economic uncertainty.What’s more encouraging is REITs’ characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. In fact, the majority of leases are tied to inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even amid the inflationary period, investment in the REIT industry can offer a steady stream of income.Story continuesHere’s How We Selected These REITsHowever, not all REITs are equally capable of keeping up their dividend-paying momentum. Therefore, to pick the right dividend stocks, we have employed the Zacks Stocks Screener and have shortlisted the REITs with a dividend yield of more than 2% (this criterion includes companies with a dividend yield above the S&amp;P 500′s average dividend yield of roughly 2%). Apart from this, we have considered REITs that have five-year historical dividend growth of greater than or equal to 0.001 (including companies that have increased their dividend over the past five years).Moreover, these stocks have a sturdy business model, which protects them from market volatility, and are known for providing a steady stream of income. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our ChoicesNew York, NY-based VICI Properties Inc. is an experiential REIT engaged in the business of owning, acquiring and developing gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations.VICI Properties enjoys the ownership of three of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the Las Vegas Strip, namely Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas. The company has made concerted efforts to grow its portfolio and team up with the best-in-class tenants. Such efforts are likely to aid VICI’s performance in the coming quarters.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share has been revised 4.9% north over the past week to $1.92.VICI pays out a quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share ($1.56 annualized), which gives it a 4.63% yield at the current stock price. The company has increased its dividend six times in the last five years and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 11.7%. Check VICI Properties’ dividend history here.VICI Properties Inc.

Also, the consensus mark for 2023 FFO per share has moved north over the past week to $9.18.MAA pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share ($5.00 annualized), which gives it a 3.14% yield at the current stock price.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $1.36 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 5, 2031. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on FLRAAThe aforementioned contract is based on Bell’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor, which was developed and tested as part of the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR TD) program that began in 2013. The V-280 progressed through design, manufacturing, and more than three years of rigorous flight testing that provided extensive data validating the technical and operational advantages of the aircraft for long-range assault missions.The initial contract refines the FLRAA weapon system design, sustainment, digital enterprise, manufacturing, systems integration, flight-testing and airworthiness qualification.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have also been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe bumped-up defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunition of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to expand at a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This is likely to benefit Textron, with its Bell segment consistently innovating combat helicopters as well as upgrading the existing models to expand in the military rotorcraft market. In March 2022, Bell submitted its final Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) proposal revision to the U.S. Army and expects to receive the contract in October 2022.Story continuesThe growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft to U.S. armed forces along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations. Some of its product ranges include CH-53K, S-92, UH-60 Black Hawk, etc.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.2%. LMT shares have risen 41.1% in the past year.Boeing’s portfolio of helicopters comprises the AH-6 Little Bird, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey and H-47 Chinook aircraft and in-development entrants, which include the MH-139A Grey Wolf and DEFIANT X. Its military rotorcraft is currently used by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as allied defense forces in over 20 countries across the globe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2022 earnings implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure. BA’s shares have moved up 11.8% in the past three months.Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout is a combat-proven, autonomous helicopter system providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target-acquisition, laser designation and battle management for tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. It’s available in two variants – MQ-8B Fire Scout and MQ-8C Fire Scout.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.

182,8ccaa899-dca0-3efe-970a-4fce529a8794,NKE,2022-12-09,NIKE's (NYSE:NKE) investors will be pleased with their favorable 81% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikes-nyse-nke-investors-pleased-110050873.html,1670583650,STORY,['NKE'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the NIKE share price has climbed 73% in five years, easily topping the market return of 43% (ignoring dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for NIKE While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, NIKE achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into NIKE's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of NIKE's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, NIKE's TSR for the last 5 years was 81%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 18% in the twelve months, NIKE shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Before forming an opinion on NIKE you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.Of course NIKE may not be the best stock to buy.

But is it?Tracey and John again look at the important economic data, including the jobs data. One thing that is clear, is that the US economy is currently not in a recession, despite many in the media harping that it is. The US is averaging monthly payroll gains of 392,000 in 2022 through November.And the weekly jobless claims data has yet to show much slowing.Where Should You Invest in 2023?If a recession IS coming next year, where should an investor be hiding out?1.       Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFEThe drug stocks have been popular with investors over the last few years due to the pandemic.Eli Lilly shares are up 32% year-to-date and are breaking out to new 5-year highs. However, analysts have been cutting earnings estimates at Eli Lilly recently. Earnings are expected to fall 4.7% in 2022.Story continuesEli Lilly may be popular with investors, but it’s not cheap. It is trading with a forward P/E of 47.However, the reverse is true of Pfizer. Pfizer is dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.9 but shares have also fallen 17% this year.While Pfizer earnings are expected to be up 46% in 2022, analysts expect them to fall 25% in 2023.Are Eli Lilly and Pfizer the wrong place to be in 2023?2.       JPMorgan Chase JPMWith the Fed raising rates, you’d think that banks like JPMorgan Chase would be a place to hide out in this year, and next.Shares of JPMorgan Chase are down 17% year-to-date, which is mostly in line with the S&amp;P 500, but they have rallied 15% in the last 3 months. John owns JPMorgan Chase in his Large Cap Trader portfolio at Zacks.Yet shares of this big bank are cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.2. JPMorgan Chase also pays a dividend, yielding 3%.Is JPMorgan Chase a deal?3.       Ulta Beauty ULTAUlta Beauty is an American beauty retailer, with both brick and mortar and online sales. Beauty has been hot in 2022, even with inflation, because there are many ways customers can trade down, if necessary.However, both prestige and drugstore make-up are doing well this year as people attend events and experiences like weddings and prom. Ulta shares have bucked the negative trend in 2022. They are up 16.4% year-to-date and are at 5-year highs.But Ulta isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 20.5.Is the Ulta rally nearing an end or there still time to get in in 2023?4.       Invesco QQQ ETF QQQJohn believes in buying some of the beaten down ETFs for next year, including the Invesco QQQ ETF, which is simply known as the QQQ. It tracks the NASDAQ.The QQQ is down nearly 30% year-to-date. John believes investors should be dollar-cost-averaging into it next year.QQQ pays a dividend, yielding 0.7%.

But is it?Tracey and John again look at the important economic data, including the jobs data. One thing that is clear, is that the US economy is currently not in a recession, despite many in the media harping that it is. The US is averaging monthly payroll gains of 392,000 in 2022 through November.And the weekly jobless claims data has yet to show much slowing.Where Should You Invest in 2023? If a recession IS coming next year, where should an investor be hiding out?1.       Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFEThe drug stocks have been popular with investors over the last few years due to the pandemic.Eli Lilly shares are up 32% year-to-date and are breaking out to new 5-year highs. However, analysts have been cutting earnings estimates at Eli Lilly recently. Earnings are expected to fall 4.7% in 2022.Eli Lilly may be popular with investors, but it’s not cheap. It is trading with a forward P/E of 47.However, the reverse is true of Pfizer. Pfizer is dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.9 but shares have also fallen 17% this year.While Pfizer earnings are expected to be up 46% in 2022, analysts expect them to fall 25% in 2023.Story continuesAre Eli Lilly and Pfizer the wrong place to be in 2023?2.       JPMorgan Chase JPMWith the Fed raising rates, you’d think that banks like JPMorgan Chase would be a place to hide out in this year, and next.Shares of JPMorgan Chase are down 17% year-to-date, which is mostly in line with the S&amp;P 500, but they have rallied 15% in the last 3 months. John owns JPMorgan Chase in his Large Cap Trader portfolio at Zacks.Yet shares of this big bank are cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.2. JPMorgan Chase also pays a dividend, yielding 3%.Is JPMorgan Chase a deal?3.       Ulta Beauty ULTAUlta Beauty is an American beauty retailer, with both brick and mortar and online sales. Beauty has been hot in 2022, even with inflation, because there are many ways customers can trade down, if necessary.However, both prestige and drugstore make-up are doing well this year as people attend events and experiences like weddings and prom. Ulta shares have bucked the negative trend in 2022. They are up 16.4% year-to-date and are at 5-year highs.But Ulta isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 20.5.Is the Ulta rally nearing an end or there still time to get in in 2023?4.       Invesco QQQ ETF QQQJohn believes in buying some of the beaten down ETFs for next year, including the Invesco QQQ ETF, which is simply known as the QQQ. It tracks the NASDAQ.The QQQ is down nearly 30% year-to-date. John believes investors should be dollar-cost-averaging into it next year.QQQ pays a dividend, yielding 0.7%.

192,486c8ad9-3510-3b82-b59c-370d52172e79,IBM,2022-12-09,Time to Buy These Iconic Stocks for 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-iconic-stocks-2023-014301417.html,1670550181,STORY,"['IBM', 'DE']","[Past performance is, of course, not always an indication of future success but strong management and historical dominance are surely a calming feeling for investors.Two stocks that come to mind in this regard are Deere &amp; Company DE and International Business Machines IBM. Let’s see if this narrative supports buying shares of these two iconic companies at the moment.Overview While Deere and IBM’s businesses are very different, they have both been staples of the American and global economy for many years.Deere &amp; Company was founded in 1837 and has established itself as the world’s largest producer and manufacturer of agricultural equipment and machinery. International Business Machines has a long history as well. IBM was founded in 1911 and became one of the world’s most recognizable companies and a leading producer and distributor of computer hardware and software. To that note, IBM has started to adapt to current technological times to include cloud computing along with its data analytics.Over the years, both companies have paid out nice dividends to investors, with Deere’s current annual yield at 1.03% ($4.52) and IBM’s at 4.48% ($6.60).  Historical Performance Looking back 30 years, we can see the performance of both stocks has been stellar. Deere’s performance sticks out though, DE is up an astonishing +5,590% Vs. IBM’s very respectable +1069%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a 20-year view, Deere’s continued dominance becomes clearer. Including dividends, DE’s total return during this period is a staggering +2,746% to easily top IBM’s +240% and the S&amp;P 500’s 599%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we look over the last decade in the chart below, we can see the trend in Deer’s dominant performance continues and IBM begins to further lag the benchmark. Companies in Deere’s Industrial Products sector are not as pressed with having to innovate as businesses in IBM’s technology sector.IBM stock has been stable but has mostly remained in the $100-$150 range for the last 10 years as newer tech companies like Apple AAPL have enjoyed better price performance during more current tech waves. Story continuesIn comparison, AAPL’s total return in the last decade is +800% which has topped Deere as well. Still, DE and IBM have been reliable investments in their own right and have been around much longer. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRecent Performance Historically speaking, both Deere and IBM have done well for investors. However, DE has continued its very impressive performance from decade to decade, while IBM stock began to lose its sizzle from the Dot.com bubble. Interestingly, over the last year, IBM’s total return is +25% to slightly edge DE’s +23% and crush the benchmark. YTD, DE is up +30% Vs. IBM’s +16%. Both stocks have continued to blast the benchmark’s bearish-like performance. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlook &amp; Future SuccessDeere &amp; IBM’s recent performance does support the narrative that companies with strong historical performances can be great stocks to buy during economic uncertainty. Furthermore, a glance at both companies’ outlooks could help solidify this going forward.Deere &amp; Co’s current FY23 earnings are now expected to jump 17% at $27.28 per share. Fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to rise another 7%. Even better, earnings estimate revisions for both FY23 and FY24 have trended higher over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDeere’s revenue growth has been very impressive as illustrated in the above chart. Sales are forecasted to climb 13% in FY23 and rise another 2% in FY24 to $55.37 billion. FY24 would represent 41% revenue growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $39.25 billion.Pivoting to IBM, earnings are now expected to rise 15% this year to $9.12 per share. Fiscal 2023 earrings are projected to rise another 6%. With that being said earnings estimate revisions have trended down over the last quarter for this year and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales are forecasted to dip -16% in FY22, which makes what IBM can accomplish on its bottom line this year more impressive. Fiscal 2023 sales are expected to rise 1% at $59.90 billion. However, FY23 sales would represent a 22% decrease from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $77.14 billion.Deere &amp; Company’s outlook certainly supports that its future success will continue while IBM stock is less approachable in this regard despite impressive bottom-line growth.Valuation &amp; Significance Deere stock trades at 15.9X forward earnings which is near IBM’s 16.1X. However, DE stock looks more attractive relative to its past. DE stock trades at a 50% discount to its decade high of 31.8X while IBM trades around its decade high of 16.3X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to this, DE trades near its decade median of 16.6X, while IBM trades 47% above its decade-long median of 10.9X.With Deere trading at $442 per share and near its 52-week highs the stock still appears to have more upside from a valuation standpoint. IBM also trades near its highs at $147 per share. But in terms of value, now may not be the best entry point or opportunity to buy IBM.Bottom Line The recent performance of Deere and IBM has been impressive. This certainly supports the narrative that these iconic companies are strong investments during economic uncertainty.Deere, in particular, looks like a sound investment at the moment sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions. On the contrary, IBM lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as earnings estimate revisions are down despite solid growth expected for the company.One thing is for sure, both of these iconic stocks will draw investors’ interest as we head into 2023 with their performances continuing to stand out.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

194,b9871fb7-d598-3def-95a7-e5c54e688e27,IBM,2022-12-09,Is There An Opportunity With International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) 33% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-international-business-machines-corporations-140041848.html,1670508041,STORY,['IBM'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.8bUS$12.0bUS$12.9bUS$13.6bUS$14.3bUS$14.8bUS$15.3bUS$15.8bUS$16.2bUS$16.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 7.52%Est @ 5.86%Est @ 4.69%Est @ 3.88%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.91%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$9.9kUS$10.1kUS$10.0kUS$9.8kUS$9.4kUS$9.0kUS$8.5kUS$8.1kUS$7.6kUS$7.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$90bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$17b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.0%) = US$251bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$251b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$109bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$199b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$147, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.207. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For International Business Machines, there are three essential aspects you should explore:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 5 warning signs for International Business Machines (1 can't be ignored!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for IBM's future outlook?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.75%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.55%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.01%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the refiner had lost 5.92% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 5.74% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.49% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Marathon Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $6.09, up 368.46% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $32.66 billion, down 8.28% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $25.50 per share and revenue of $171 billion. These totals would mark changes of +940.82% and +41.41%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

He longed for the peace he found in nature growing up in the country in Arkansas. Pearson said he's slowly seeing that peace return as nature is coming back to Detroit.""I love to watch how certain animals feed and interact,"" said Pearson. ""I've seen fox, coyotes, squirrels, rabbits, turkey, groundhogs and raccoons. I've watched the eagles come out to eat, owls feeding at night, and bats fly out of the bat boxes. You can sit and see something different all the time.""Pearson lives near the Oakwood Forest, where Marathon Petroleum's Detroit refinery has been planting trees to re-naturalize the former residential area. In 2021, volunteers partnered with the Wildlife Habitat Council and planted 150 trees to restore and expand the green spaces.This October, Pearson joined another group of volunteers from the Detroit refinery, the University of Michigan Dearborn and local advocates to plant another 55 native trees near the Oakwood Forest and 150 trees in the nearby Boynton neighborhood.Dr. Paul Draus, a sociologist at the University of Michigan Dearborn, has been involved in the Oakwood Heights area since 2010. He brought a class of students to help plant the trees and learn about re-naturalizing landscapes in industrialized areas.""It is a long process, but I feel honored to be able to help push it along,"" said Dr. Draus. ""Most of the students had never been to this area of Detroit before, and they were surprised to learn how much history was there and how much resilience was demonstrated. Participating in the Oakwood Heights tree planting gave them a perspective on their own responsibilities as ‘climate citizens.'""Story continuesThe refinery may add fruit trees to the area, something Pearson would be happy to support.""Calvin has been very involved in the community and remains very invested in what we are trying to do,"" said Kevin Lepak, Health, Environment and Safety Professional at the Detroit refinery and organizer of the tree planting initiative. ""He shared with us that he was interested in having fruit trees nearby, so we planted a few persimmon and paw paw trees next to his house.""Pearson says Marathon has been a good neighbor, and he advocates for others to get involved and speak up.""What Marathon is doing is adding more peace to the peace,"" said Pearson. ""This area is transitioning back to nature. I wish people who grew up in the city could see what's in the woods.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures fell $2.24 (or 3%) to settle at $72.01 a barrel yesterday.Despite this, the market has been kind to oil in 2022, with commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $130 for the first time since 2008. Crude-related stocks like Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.2 million barrels compared to expectations of a 2.6 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower imports and continued strength in refinery demand accounted for the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production climbed to the highest since August.Total domestic stocks now stand at 413.9 million barrels — 4.4% less than the year-ago figure and 9% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 373,000 barrels to 23.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 25.7 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.7 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the fourth time in as many weeks. The 5.3 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to lower exports. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 2.9 million barrels. At 219.1 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is essentially in line with the year-earlier level, while it is 3% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the fourth week in succession. The 6.2 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 1.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 118.8 million barrels — are 6.2% below the year-ago level and 9% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at a more than three-year high of 95.5%, rose 0.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 53% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17.5%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 120.6%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 282% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $58.3 billion.Hess Corporation: Hess shares have appreciated 82.1% so far in 2022.

The hike in spending comes despite a reduction in the production target for 2023 by 100,000 barrels of equivalent oil per day (boed) to 2.6 million boed.The Brazilian state-owned oil major also sanctioned additional short-term drilling for existing projects above its long-term break-even of $35 per barrel. Exploration and production will make up 83% of the spending, with the output to increase to 3.1 million boed by 2027.Moreover, Petrobras more than doubled its current decarbonization fund of $248 million and planned to boost spending to reduce carbon emissions to 6% of the total compared to 4% in the previous plan. However, Brazil’s President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s transition team might review PBR's business plan next year to reflect the new government’s priorities.Headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras S.A., is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America.

We look forward to a positive working relationship with the UAW.""The closely watched vote was a crucial test of the UAW's ability to organize workers who make parts for electric vehicles. The Detroit Three automakers all have battery plants in the works with South Korean partners.The UAW may face more opposition at plants in southern states that are less unionized than Ohio.The UAW petitioned in October to represent about 900 workers at the Ohio plant after a majority of employees signed cards authorizing the union to represent them.""As the auto industry transitions to electric vehicles, new workers entering the auto sector at plants like Ultium are thinking about their value and worth,"" UAW President Ray Curry said Friday. ""This vote shows that they want to be a part of maintaining the high standards and wages that UAW members have built in the auto industry.""President Joe Biden, who in May during a trip to South Korea expressed support for U.S. workers seeking to unionize JV battery plants, on Friday congratulated the workers.""By rebuilding our infrastructure and our manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries and semi-conductors, these jobs will bring our supply chains back home,"" Biden saidProduction began in August at the Ohio plant, the first of at least four planned Ultium U.S. battery factories.GM and LG Energy are considering an Indiana site for a fourth U.S. battery plant.

Last week, Ultium said it would boost its planned investment in a $2.3 billion Tennessee plant by another $275 million.In July, the U.S. Energy Department said it intended to lend Ultium $2.5 billion to help finance new manufacturing facilities. Sources told Reuters the loan could be finalized as soon as next week.Last week, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra expressed support for unionizing the Ohio plant. Barra told reporters Thursday she wanted to get a labor agreement as soon as possible if Ohio workers voted in favor and said ""I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that if you're union you're more expensive.""

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2022.When companies want to raise cash for their businesses, there are two main ways to go about this. The first one is to issue equity and get investment in return. This is why most major companies opt for IPOs or initial public offerings, where shares of the company are issued for a set price initially, which is then dictated by market dynamics. Other times, companies issue right shares which are shares issued to existing shareholders at a specified price. When people start a company, they generally require investment to scale up their ambitions, and these companies are private at the time. They then invite investors and pitch their project and their company and offer a part of their company in exchange for the investment. The best kind of example for this is the TV show Shark Tank, where people who have started companies pitch their idea and financials to get major investors to invest in their companies while also providing expertise gained from decades of experience.Another way to raise money is debt. Debt involves borrowing money, often from banks, to fund operations and paying it back based on a specific term along with interest. There are several reasons that companies may opt for debt rather than equity with the primary one being that taking on debt does not lead to dilution of ownership, thus ensuring that profits stay within the company rather than losing out in the form of interest and principal payments. Debt also helps increase tax savings as interest is an allowable tax expense and hence lowers the profit calculation for tax purposes. Further, debt is generally considered to have a lower finance cost as opposed to equity. Remember, raising equity doesn't mean that there isn't any cost; shareholders are investing as they want the best possible return on their money and so the cost of equity is definitely very real. Also, equity means that shareholders get returns forever while debt is for a limited time period and after the payment of the principal along with interest, no further payments have to be made. For example, if you issue 1% of equity for $100,000 thereby valuing your company at $10 million, the shareholders of the issued equity will be owed 1% forever, while if you got debt of $100,000 for a period of 5 years at an annual interest rate of 10%, with principal paid off in 5 installments at the end of each year, you would have paid back $130,000 in 5 years.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the world are also some of the most indebted companies in the world. The total debt of the 22 most indebted companies globally is more than $2.5 trillion, bigger than most economies in the world.

A lack of charging infrastructure has been one of the main obstacles. This according to a study from San Jose University-- San Jose State University. General Motors hoping to boost charger availability by leveraging its dealer network to choose charging locations in their communities and subsidizing the deployment cost.Joining us to explain is Hoss Hassani, General Motors vice president, EV Ecosystem. Good to have you on today. I'm going to start with a stat I know GM always likes to mention, which is that 90% of Americans are within 10 miles of a GM dealership. So you've got that in place. Now you're allowing or actually offering up these charging stations to dealers to deploy. To what extent is that likely to accelerate EV adoption?HOSS HASSANI: Well, Akiko, great to be with you. And one of GM's visions, ambitions is to have everybody in an EV, not just to see EV in the markets where we're currently seeing a lot of adoption. And that means in the heartland of the country, in the middle of the country, in exurban and rural communities, as well as communities that are currently underserved by EV infrastructure.So for us, getting 40,000 chargers deployed across the US and Canada in those communities, those thousands of communities that don't have a single charger there today, is hugely consequential, in our view, for accelerating EV adoption.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Hoss, talk about the decision to have them deployed in the community versus the actual GM dealers themselves.HOSS HASSANI: Yeah, I mean, listen, it's obvious and predictable that we would deploy them at dealerships. And in fact, our dealerships are installing EV infrastructure on their properties as a condition of selling and servicing our EVs. But we thought the opportunity was to go farther than that, and not just to get charging more accessible, but also to start supporting local businesses, small businesses, communities, popular community destinations, and so forth.Story continuesSince we announced the program last year, we had a number of businesses reach out to us and say, hey, I want to be a host for one of these locations. And we think bringing everybody in, which is not just the driver of the vehicle, but letting the communities participate, that is something that's very core to General Motors' identity and fabric in this community in this economy. And we just think it makes a lot of sense.AKIKO FUJITA: Hoss, a majority of these being deployed are level two chargers. And while it's on the faster end, we're still talking about, what, roughly three hours to get to 80% charge. I mean, what do you think is the tipping point? For those who are kind of on the edge saying, well, should I get an EV or not, that's still a long time to charge up if you don't have a charging system at home.HOSS HASSANI: For sure, and today, we are saying that 90%-- 80% to 90% of charging is happening at home and a little bit at the workplace. DC fast charging makes up about 15% to 20% of the infrastructure. That's where you see those really quick top-ups, half an hour to 80% and so forth.But 80% of the charging infrastructure in the US and Canada today is that level two charging. And it serves a different use case. When you think about locations that people hang out at and spend a lot of time at, a couple hours at a library, at campus at school, and the employer and so forth, that's really where level two charging makes sense. It's more affordable to charge on level two charging.And in fact, a lot of level two chargers across the continent are, in fact, free. And so we see level two charging really complementary to the investments that we're also making in DC fast charging as part of our $750 million commitment to expand EV infrastructure across North America.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And what sort of headwinds could you also be looking at as you try and expand this?HOSS HASSANI: I really think the only headwinds are our own ambition, frankly. And what we're doing here, we just-- you know, the immediately preceding segment talking about continued challenges with the supply chain and so forth, we've, of course, partnered with companies. And we've got a good view here that those 40,000 charges that we're looking to deploy, we will deploy in the time frame that we're looking to do it.One of the other advantages of level two charging infrastructure versus DC fast charging, you require less upgrades and utilities and so forth. It's much quicker to install. And in fact, we've had our first installations through this program in Wisconsin and in Michigan and are looking to build on that with hundreds and thousands more installations in the months ahead.AKIKO FUJITA: Hoss, how much of this is about trying to get drivers to warm up to the GM EV brand? I mean, we heard from your president, Mark Reuss several weeks ago, saying that GM's actually serviced about 11,000 Teslas. And while you've been open to that, there's got to be a bit of a wooing game that's happening, right?HOSS HASSANI: Well, without a doubt, listen, I mean, up until now, with gasoline powered vehicles, it's always been about brand reputation. And the product itself that is made really inform people's decisions, which vehicle they were going to purchase. When you get into electric vehicles that is, of course, there, having stellar product with excellent range reliability and features and amenities, and the brand's reputation really matters.But one thing that is fundamentally different about an EV is the fact that charging is, in most cases, a daily ritual for folks-- at home, whether they're plugging it in overnight, like they do their phone, whether they're going on a road trip. That is an experience that they're going to be having much more frequently than a gas fill-up in a very good way.And for us, we know that General Motors is absolutely going to lead in that charging experience that people are going to have every single day. And that's going to be hugely consequential to the decision of which EV people want to choose. And so combine that with the exceptional vehicles that we're going to have, electric vehicles in every category from Equinox up to Celestiq, and that world class charging experience, powered by the app, powered by the in-vehicle experience, we know that that is going to catapult General Motors to the leadership category in EVs.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We know more charging stations certainly sweetens the deal for people on the fence thinking about EVs. Hoss Hassani, General Motors vice president, EV Ecosystem, thank you so much for joining us this morning.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is reiterating a positive outlook for the global airline industry and forecasts that airlines combined will record a net profit of $4.7 billion next year. That would be the industry’s first positive season since the pandemic started in 2020. IATA observed in June that industry wide profitability “appears within reach” in 2023. As per data by IATA, passenger levels will return to pre-pandemic numbers in 2024, which is approximately 5.2 billion passengers. Airline industry losses in 2022 reached $6.9 billion, shrinking from the $9.7 billion loss forecast in June. IATA chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said that the industry’s financial results were “nothing but phenomenal.”Shipping rates that ran rampant during challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have now plunged, which some market experts are calling a “freight recession”, as inventory surplus across the US met weaker demand. This scenario has put the shipping freight sector at a disadvantage during annual contract negotiations, but this is positive for retailers and other customers who will benefit from reasonable transportation costs. Some of the best transportation stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP). Our Methodology We selected the following transportation stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. 10 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023FiledIMAGE/Shutterstock.comBest Transportation Stocks To Buy Heading Into 202310. Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) was incorporated in 2006 and is based in Marousi, Greece. It is a shipping company that specializes in the ocean transportation of dry bulk cargoes worldwide. The company's vessels transport iron ores, coal, grains, bauxite, fertilizers, and steel products. Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) is set to pay a $1.20 per share quarterly dividend on December 12, to shareholders of the company as of November 30. The dividend yield on December 8 came in at 26.03%. Story continuesOn October 27, Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra maintained a Buy recommendation on Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $33 from $40 ahead of the company's Q3 results.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) was part of 16 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 18 in the prior quarter. Howard Marks’ Oaktree Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 26 million shares worth $454.8 million. In addition to Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP), Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) is one of the best transportation stocks to consider buying for 2023. Here is what Massif Capital has to say about Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We initiated one long position, one short position and exited one position during the third quarter. Our new long position was in Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK), a pure-play dry bulk operator with roughly 120 controlled vessels and 14 million tons of combined cargo capacity globally.SBLK has one of the better management teams in the maritime shipping industry and the lowest cost structure among all dry bulk names. After announcing their new dividend policy in May, SBLK now has one of the best payout structures in shipping. The firm has paid out $0.3 and $0.7 per share in dividends for the first and second quarters of 2021. SBLK will most likely announce a dividend for the third quarter somewhere in the $1.15-$1.25 per share range, depending on movement in net working capital.We believe the best way to look at this business is through cash generation potential and how much is returned to investors. The current equity valuation does not reflect current rates for shipping (earnings), partly because of the velocity of the move in rates and because shipping cycles turn, and it’s not clear whether this is a local top or the early innings of a multi-year cycle. Our belief is the latter. Part of our catalyst is the market re-rating the stock higher once the length of the increased earnings power becomes understood. It is a relatively strong catalyst in the sense that with a strong dividend policy, we can be patient for the market to underwrite this story as the cash is either returned to us via a high dividend yield if the market is either slow or chooses not to join our side of the trade.Our estimates suggest a time-charter equivalent rate (net profit or loss of operating a vessel daily) of at least $30,000 for SBLK in Q4, with the firm earning a potential annual average of $26,000. Our base case is that this is a strong floor going into next year, with little need to articulate much more upside. If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we could see a 20+% annual dividend next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity such that the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock. Today our base case target for the firm is $37 per share. This is likely conservative as we know that third-quarter rates are higher than the second quarter, and third-quarter dividends will most likely reflect that. We are cautious about diving too deep into the sensitivities to the upside with this position as we are arriving at some pretty remunerative torque using current contracted values and seemingly conservative forecasts…” (Click here to see the full text)9.

With oil price moving north, fuel costs flared up significantly, hurting the bottom-line performance of transportation stocks. This is because fuel expenses represent one of the major input costs for transportation players.Supply-chain woes have also resulted in elevated costs. Also, staff shortages led to multiple flight cancellations, affecting profitability in turn.Due to the abovementioned headwinds, the sector has declined 16.5% year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, we would like to remind investors that despite the challenges there are multiple reasons to continue investing in the transportation sector.How Will 2023 Shape Up for Transportation Companies?The transportation sector, being widely diversified in nature, includes airlines, railroads, package delivery companies and truckers to name a few. Relaxation of COVID-19 travel restrictions and re-opening of the global economy have benefited transportation companies this year and are expected to do so in 2023 also.Airline stocks are benefiting from a solid recovery in air-travel demand as people are again booking flights, leading to higher passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines’ top lines.Given the upside in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This supports growth of railroad operators and transportation service providers. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 2.9% year over year in October. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in six (February, March, July, August, September and October) of the 10 months reported so far this year. We expect this trend to continue in 2023.Online shopping continues to gain despite the reopening of the normal market. This continued strength in e-commerce demand bodes well for packaging companies in the sector.Story continuesDue to increased demand, the financial health of transportation companies has improved this year. As a result, we have seen many companies in the space hiking dividends. Dividend stocks are safe bets for creating wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Investors are always on the lookout for dividend stocks as these provide a steady source of income and a cushion against market uncertainty, as is the current scenario.Considering these aforementioned favorable factors to continue in 2023 also, we believe investing in stocks like United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL, Ryder System, Inc. R and Air Transport Services Group, Inc. ATSG seems a prudent move.3 Transportation Stocks Set to Fly High Next YearWe have picked three transportation stocks, which are set to perform well in 2023 and are backed by a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

(NYSE:PNC) stock at an average sell price of US$184 during the past year. The company's market valuation decreased by US$5.3b after the stock price dropped 7.8% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services GroupThe Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$155. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In total, PNC Financial Services Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

In total, Executive VP Deborah Guild sold US$452k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own about US$213m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since PNC Financial Services Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

While the factory of the early days involved workers, now, companies rely on automated processes to make machines do their bidding. Automation is not limited only to manufacturing operations. Instead, it has also spread to power generation and even healthcare, with robots and timed delivery systems reducing the workload on doctors, surgeons, and nurses.Therefore, it's no surprise that the automation industry itself is worth billions of dollars. A research report from Acumen Research and Consulting outlines that the industry was worth $189.7 billion last year and from the end of this year to 2030, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7% to sit at $430.9 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm notes that a variety of different factors such as real time data for preventive analytics, robotic processes, intra company linkages through enterprise resource planning systems, and the growth in machine learning and big data analytics will drive the industry forward. Several different industries rely on automation these days, such as aerospace and defense, energy, pharmaceuticals, and automobile manufacturing. Asia Pacific is the largest automation market in the world, particularly since China's role as the world's manufacturing hub requires companies such as Foxconn to bring robots to their aid.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the industrial automation market was worth $191.89 billion. It will grow to $205.86 billion by the end of this year, and from then until 2030, continue growing at a 9.8% CAGR for a final value of $395 billion. The firm adds that there is pent up growth in the industry due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic that stalled manufacturing, and at the same time, COVID also spurred the adoption of industrial automation due to the reduced need for social distance measures. Robots, after all, do not catch the coronavirus. However, Fortune Business Insights disagrees with Acumen Research when it comes to the largest industrial automation market. According to this research firm, Europe held the largest share of the pie in 2021, with an estimated market value of $61.85 billion. IoT and augmented reality will drive automation; however, a key hindrance will be large capital expenditures.Story continuesToday's piece will focus on the largest automation companies that either operate in or provide their services in the United States.

Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Norwegian Cruise Line due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Norwegian Cruise Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesNorwegian Cruise reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, both metrics improved year over year.The company is benefiting from improving occupancy. In the third quarter of 2022, occupancy improved 17 basis points to nearly 82%. The company anticipates occupancy levels to improve and reach historical levels for the second quarter of 2023. In fourth-quarter 2022, the company expects occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80 percent range.Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionNorwegian Cruise reported an adjusted loss per share of 64 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 71 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported a loss per share of $2.17.Quarterly revenues of $1,615.5 million beat the consensus mark of $1,576 million. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported revenues of $153.1 million. The upside can primarily be attributed to the resumption of cruise operations.In the quarter under review, passenger ticket revenues were $1,105.9 million compared with $86.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Onboard and other revenues increased to $509.6 million from $67 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Expenses &amp; Operating ResultsTotal cruise operating expenses increased 181.7% in the quarter under review from the year-ago quarter’s levels. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages. The company noted that the increase in 2022 reflects an improvement in payroll, fuel and direct variable costs of fully operating ships.Gross cruise costs in the third quarter increased 141.3% year over year to $1,614.2 million. Adjusted net cruise costs (excluding fuel) amounted to $947.7 million compared with $538 million in the prior-year quarter. Fuel price per metric ton (net of hedges) increased to $830 from $693 in 2021.Net interest expenses in the quarter were $152.3 million, up from $161.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesBalance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2022, were $1.2 billion compared with $1.5 billion at the end of Dec 31, 2021. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2022, came in at $12.9 billion compared with $11.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2021.Guidance &amp; Booking UpdatesThe company said that booked position for fourth-quarter 2022 is below the comparable 2019 level. However, booking trends for 2023 remain in line with that of 2019. Pricing is meaningfully higher than that of 2019 at the same point in time for the full year 2023.Due to the coronavirus outbreak and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the company is unable to estimate the impact on its business. The company expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. In fourth-quarter 2022, it anticipates net interest expenses to be nearly $170 million. For the full year, it expects the same to be $610 million, excluding losses on extinguishment of debt. Depreciation and amortization are forecast to be roughly $195 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $740 million for the full year of 2022.The company expects occupancy to be in the mid-to-high 80% range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Capacity days are anticipated to be 5.1 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be in the range of $1.4-$1.5 billion. Adjusted net cruise cost (excluding fuel per capacity day) is likely to decline nearly 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -23.59% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Norwegian Cruise Line has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Norwegian Cruise Line has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNorwegian Cruise Line belongs to the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Royal Caribbean (RCL), has gained 7.6% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Royal Caribbean reported revenues of $2.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +555%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with -$4.91 a year ago.Royal Caribbean is expected to post a loss of $1.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +72.8%.

222,dfe47b40-fbde-3290-b86b-3a21c0a9820b,ROST,2022-12-09,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Ross Stores (ROST): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-143802215.html,1670510282,STORY,['ROST'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Ross Stores (ROST) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Ross Stores currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.47, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.47 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 76.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ROSTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ROSTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Ross Stores here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Ross Stores, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Analog Devices has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices peKeen to find out how analysts think Analog Devices' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Analog Devices' Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Analog Devices would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 51% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 47% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 12% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Analog Devices' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Analog Devices maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.A lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet. Our free balance sheet analysis for Analog Devices  with six simple checks will allow you to discover any risks that could be an issue.If you're unsure about the strength of Analog Devices' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.75%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.55%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.01%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the global payments processor had gained 7.16% over the past month. This has outpaced the Business Services sector's gain of 4.31% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.49% in that time.Visa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Visa is projected to report earnings of $2 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 10.5%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.68 billion, up 8.76% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.30 per share and revenue of $31.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of +10.67% and +8.82%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Visa is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Visa currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 25.03. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.34, so we one might conclude that Visa is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that V currently has a PEG ratio of 1.67. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Financial Transaction Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.81 at yesterday's closing price.The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 171, putting it in the bottom 33% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Be sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(V): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-visa-inc-140002168.html,1670508002,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +7.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2 per share, indicating a change of +10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.30 points to a change of +10.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $31.9 billion and $35.47 billion estimates indicate +8.8% and +11.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That would be some 4.5 percentage points below the year's peak in March.At least the numbers are expected to be reliable. Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Friday it was cancelling next week's producer price report after discovering further potential problems with the calculation of the series dogged by errors in diesel and food prices.The disinflation theme more generally has been encouraged by the plunge in Brent crude oil prices this week to their lowest of the year below $76 per barrel, although a major leak lifted U.S. prices marginally on Friday.Canada's TC Energy shut its Keystone pipeline in the United States after more than 14,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into a creek in Kansas, making it one of the largest crude spills in the United States in nearly a decade.Hopes for a China economic reboot, however, lifted London copper prices, which rose for a fourth consecutive session on Friday to hit their highest in more than five months.Story continuesU.S. stock futures were marginally higher ahead of Wall Street's open after the S&amp;P500 broke a 5-day losing streak on Thursday. U.S. Treasury yields were steady after rebounding from 3-month lows yesterday. The dollar was a touch lower.Elsewhere, Britain's finance ministry on Friday set out plans to overhaul the financial sector, including a review of rules to make bankers accountable for their decisions and easing capital requirements for smaller lenders.Credit Suisse stock rose another 3% after it hailed on Thursday a ""milestone"" in its turnaround plan after raising 2.24 billion Swiss francs ($2.39 billion) as part of a 4 billion franc fund raising. Shareholders exercised 98.4% of their subscription rights, giving a boost to managers tasked with getting the Swiss bank back on track after the biggest crisis in its 166-year history.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* U.S. Nov producer prices, University of Michigan's Dec consumer sentiment* U.S. Federal Reserve issues quarterly financial accounts of the United States* U.S. corporate earnings: Oracle Graphic: China's negative PPI, slowing CPI growth in Nov, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/xmvjkkgmqpr/chart.png Graphic: Jobless claims, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klpyggemlpg/joblessclaims2.png Graphic: Heading the wrong direction? https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/znvnbbdqyvl/chart.png(By Mike Dolan, editing by Jane Merriman mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

It did not say when the review would be completed.The plan focuses on expanding the critical minerals sector and ""moving things forward expeditiously,"" Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said at a news conference in Vancouver.Wilkinson said the strategy, backed by nearly C$4 billion ($2.95 billion) allocated in the 2022 budget, ""is a roadmap for the creation of wealth and sustainable jobs throughout the value chain in every region of this country.""Under the strategy, companies will be offered help in applying for permits and for federal support through the Critical Minerals Centre of Excellence. The office is already operating with a team of about 15 people, said a senior government source.Critical minerals are key elements in EV batteries, electronics and solar panels and play a crucial role in the transition to the green economy. While Canada is home of some the largest deposits of critical minerals, it can take anywhere between five and 25 years for a mining project to become operational, the document said.""We recognize that, although responsible regulations are vital, complex regulatory and permitting processes can hinder the economic competitiveness of the sector and increase investment risk for proponents,"" the document reads.As the world shifts to cleaner technologies, demand for critical minerals is expected to skyrocket. Many in the mining industry have said the bureaucracy is too slow and is holding up investment.Story continues""What has been the tendency over many years is that the requirements just keep ballooning and you end up with impact assessment reports (for new mines) that are thousands of pages long,"" said Pierre Gratton, president and chief executive of the Mining Association of Canada, adding that he welcomed a review of the permitting process.""We're not looking for yet another overhaul of the federal regime. We're looking at opportunities to implement existing requirements more expeditiously. ... There are definitely opportunities to speed things up,"" he said.China dominates the market for critical minerals used in EV batteries.Countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan want to wean themselves from their dependence on authoritarian regimes for strategically important materials.'EVERYONE WANTS A PIECE OF CANADA'Canada signed a joint action plan with the United States in 2020 to advance secure supply chains for critical minerals. It has signed similar critical minerals cooperation agreements with Japan and the European Union.""I've talked to the Americans more in the last few years than I had ever talked to them in my entire career, and also Europeans,"" Gratton said. ""Everyone wants a piece of Canada right now, and they keep knocking on our door.""The new strategy lays out priorities along the entire critical-mineral value chain, from exploration and mining to recycling old batteries, and it also covers the need for new infrastructure in often remote corners of the country.Ottawa will seek ""regulatory harmonization"" with the United States on critical minerals, the document reads without elaborating.Ottawa's strategy prioritizes developing lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements. At the same time, Canada is offering a 30% tax credit to spur exploration for nickel, lithium, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium and uranium.($1 = 1.3579 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Steve Scherer; Additional reporting by Ismail Shaki; Editing by Stephen Coates, Crispian Balmer and Richard Chang)]"

Anglo estimates it will produce around 300,000 tonnes a year for the first 10 years.The company also forecast a 3% drop in overall output this calendar year as the Quellaveco ramp-up and strong diamond output only partly made up for the lower output elsewhere. It said production should grow about 5% in 2023 from 2022 levels.Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad told investors the company's focus in 2022 has been to restore normal operations after the COVID-19 related disruptions, which added to worries over global economic volatility, extreme weather and other local disruptions to operations.Anglo mines copper, nickel, platinum group metals and iron ore, which are used to make electric batteries or renewable power infrastructure or food preservation technologies.Wanblad said while the demand for metals and minerals would be strong in the long term, there are chances of ""structural shortage"" to meet the energy transition demands.After returning record dividends to shareholders thanks to strong commodity prices in 2021, Anglo in July cut payouts on higher costs and lower production.High inflation, the prospect of a global recession and doubts about demand in China, the world's biggest user of raw materials, could hit earnings for Anglo and its peers as costs rise.Story continuesThe company expects to spend $5 billion to $6.5 billion annually for the next three years and grow output until 2024, after which it predicted some levelling in 2025.Anglo also said that developing the Woodsmith fertiliser nutrients deposit in Britain's North York Moors National Park, would require an investment of $500 million in 2022 and $800 million next year.(Reporting by Clara Denina, Helen Reid, Pushkala Aripaka; Editing by Rashmi Aich, Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Arun Koyyur)]"
235,d183db6c-5424-3fea-bcc9-1064af25174d,NWSA,2022-12-09,News Corp. (NWSA) Up 12.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-corp-nwsa-12-6-163004908.html,1670517004,STORY,['NWSA'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for News Corp. (NWSA). Shares have added about 12.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is News Corp. due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.News Corporation’s Q1 Earnings Miss EstimatesNews Corporation reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and the bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined from the year-ago fiscal period’s respective figures. NWSA witnessed revenue declines across all its segments except Dow Jones.Quarterly DetailsNews Corporation delivered adjusted quarterly earnings of 12 cents a share. The bottom-line figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and plunged 47.8% from adjusted earnings of 23 cents reported in the last fiscal year’s comparable period.Total revenues of $2,478 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,568 million and dipped 1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. The decline was mainly due to negative foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Book Publishing segment on account of lower physical book sales from Amazon, partly offset by higher revenues in the Dow Jones segment. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 6% negative impact on revenues. Adjusted revenues rose 3%.Total EBITDA decreased 15% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $350 million, thanks to higher costs due to inflationary pressures and lower sales. Foreign currency fluctuations had a $23-million negative impact on total segment EBITDA. Adjusted total segment EBITDA fell 13%.Segment DetailsRevenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment slipped 1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading to $421 million, induced by a 5% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment revenues increased 3%.Revenues in Move dipped 6% to $169 million due to lower real-estate revenues, somewhat offset by increased advertising revenues. Real Estate revenues, contributing 84% to total Move revenues, fell 9% due to the tough macroeconomic landscape, including higher household interest rates. The referral model generated 30% of the overall Move revenues in the reported quarter. Move’s internal data shows that average monthly unique users of Realtor.com’s web and mobile sites fell 11% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to 86 million. Lead volume also dropped 32%.Revenues at the REA Group inched up 2% to $252 million, driven by greater depth penetration, growth in national listings and higher Australian residential revenues on price increases. The upside was somewhat offset by 9% foreign currency headwinds and lower financial services revenues.The Subscription Video Services segment’s revenues were $502 million, down 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. Foreign currency fluctuations adversely impacted the segment’s revenues by 8%. Increased revenues from Kayo and BINGE as well as higher commercial and advertising revenues were partly offset by fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Adjusted segment’s revenues rose 6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $542 million.Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented nearly 25% of the overall circulation and subscription revenues compared with 19% in the prior year. Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were 4.5 million as of Sep 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. The upside can be attributed to an increase in BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partly offset by lower residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn improved slightly to 14.2% from 14% in the previous fiscal year. Broadcast ARPU grew 1% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s reading to A$83 (US$57).Revenues at the Dow Jones segment rose 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $515 million. This includes contributions of $34 million and $18 million from the buyouts of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted segment revenues grew 6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level owing to higher circulation and subscription revenues from digital subscription gains and growth in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, and increased digital advertising revenues. The segment’s digital revenues contributed 79% to total revenues compared with 75% seen in the last fiscal year.Circulation and subscription revenues improved 19% during the fiscal quarter under discussion. Circulation revenues rose 5%, driven by consistent strength in the digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues jumped 40%, mainly driven by the OPIS and CMA acquisitions and an improvement in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, offset by negative currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues represented 68% of the circulation revenues.Advertising revenues increased 4%, primarily owing to an 11% rise in digital advertising revenues, partly offset by a 6%-drop in print advertising revenues. Digital advertising accounted for nearly 65% of the total advertising revenues in the reported quarter.During the fiscal quarter, the overall average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached above 4.9 million, up 8% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 13%. Subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal jumped 8% to 3.8 million average subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal increased 13% to more than 3.1 million average subscriptions, accounting for 84% of the total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $487 million, down 11% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level, mainly due to the lower physical book sales stemming from Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of the warehouse footprint. This resulted in lower order volumes and higher returns in spite of the consumer sales data being consistent with the previous quarters’ statistics. Foreign currency headwinds also hurt revenues to the tune of 4%. Major titles in the fiscal quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner.  The segment’s adjusted revenues fell 7%. Digital sales grew 1% on increased sales of downloadable audiobooks, offset by lower e-book sales. Digital sales accounted for 23% of the consumer revenues compared with 21% in the prior fiscal year. Backlist sales represented about 65% of the overall revenues in the fiscal first quarter.Revenues in the News Media segment dipped 4% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level to $553 million in the reported quarter due to the adverse impact of 11% from the foreign currency fluctuations. This was partly offset by increased circulation and subscription revenues, and growth in advertising revenues at constant currency. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia rose 1%, while the metric at News UK declined 9%. Adjusted revenues for the segment climbed 6%.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 6% due to lower print volumes and a 12% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations.Advertising revenues dipped 4% due to negative foreign currency fluctuations of 9% because of a fall in print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group, partly due to the absence of the Euro 2020.Digital revenues contributed 36% to the News Media segment’s revenues compared with 33% in the year-ago fiscal quarter. The same accounted for 33% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. As of Sep 30, 2022, The Times and Sunday Times’ closing digital subscribers comprising the Times Literary Supplement were 468,000. The same at the News Corp Australia was 1,012,000. New York Post’s digital network attained about 151 million monthly unique users in the same month.Story continuesOther Financial AspectsNews Corporation ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,458 million, borrowings of $2,977 million and a stockholders’ equity of $7,872 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $856 million.Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. NWSA incurred capital expenditures of $104 million in the said period. Free cash flow available to News Corporation was a negative $122 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -25.71% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, News Corp. has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise News Corp. has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNews Corp. is part of the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry.

The move to a cloud-native, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks. Verizon has been a global leader in virtualizing its network, announcing recently it already has 8,000 cell sites already virtualized in its network with an eye towards virtualizing 20,000 sites.Virtualizing the far edge of the RAN – the cell sites closest to the customer - is a function of decoupling the hardware and software associated with a cell tower and transitioning the software so that it’s not just stored in the cloud, but is designed for a cloud-native architecture and operation.Just this week, Verizon and Ericsson published a position paper outlining the optimal technology path for VRAN in order to maximize the performance and efficiency of the network, disaggregate hardware from software, and simplify deployment wherever possible. This technology is built into the first Ericsson virtualized cell site deployed in the Verizon network.Components of VRANVerizon coordinated with many ecosystem partners to welcome Ericsson’s first virtualized cell site.Story continuesEricsson provided its commercial 5G Cloud RAN solution, consisting of a virtualized Central Unit (vCU), a virtualized Distributed Unit (vDU), and radio units. This software-based 5G Cloud RAN solution spans across all of Verizon’s frequency bands, utilizing both FDD and TDD 5G spectrum assets, including Massive MIMO support for C-band and interconnecting previously deployed equipment to enable Ericsson Spectrum Sharing between LTE and NR carriers. The Ericsson Cloud RAN solution offers Verizon efficiency and in network deployment and operational management transformation.Intel provided its 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Intel vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100 and Intel Ethernet Network Adapter E810 to deliver the processing, acceleration and connectivity requirements.Red Hat provided Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to manage their fleet at scale in collaboration with Red Hat Consulting. As part of the solution, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management delivers cloud-scale manageability by configuring the 5G RAN using a Distributed Unit (DU) profile, which deploys real-time OS kernel optimizations to run vRAN and other cloud-native application workloads from a single console. Red Hat OpenShift also incorporates zero-touch provisioning to enable distributed deployment at scale required to operate a large scale RAN.Virtualization paves the way for exciting innovationVerizon has been leading the way in virtualization with its vendor partners for years. Verizon began the journey by virtualizing the core of its network. In the years since, Verizon has been working with partners in lab trials and field tests and has been deploying cloud-based cell sites, building programmability into the network to meet the needs of today’s 5G customers and 5G solutions of tomorrow.Key 5G use cases focused on providing the best, most efficient network for customers, will heavily rely on the programmability of virtualized networks. Networks must serve IoT devices that do very little networking and stay in place, smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment, and complex solutions like Augmented Reality that require massive computing capabilities on the edge of the network. These various network solutions rely on a correlated variety of resources from the network, which until recently have been defined rigidly and manually. Using orchestration and automation capabilities at scale on virtual infrastructure, Verizon automates network configuration changes and resource scaling dynamically based on demand. This is one of the greatest benefits of virtualizing a network - essentially building programmability into the network.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $133.6 billion in 2021. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.VERIZON’S ONLINE MEDIA CENTER: News releases, stories, media contacts and other resources are available at verizon.com/news.

Reflecting in-depth research and numerous conversations with industry leaders, it outlines major themes likely to shape the fashion landscape in the year ahead and assesses a range of possible responses.Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat was interviewed for the report, sharing her insights on how the company is staying close to the consumer despite major global shifts, economic volatility, and a post-pandemic world.This interview was originally included in Business of Fashion's annual ""State of Fashion"" report on page 47 and has been condensed. To read the full interview, visit businessoffashion.com. By Tamison O'ConnorThe past 12 months have seen the industry trying to figure out what business looks like in a post-pandemic world. How have you approached this at Tapestry? What are the rules for success that have shifted, what dynamics are more or less constant compared with pre-pandemic times?I think the only constant is change. That's the one thing we've learned. As we embarked on our transformation, which we've been working on the last couple of years, we were asking exactly that question: What do we need to compete in the new world of retail? We were seeing a lot of trends in the market, and we wanted to position the company to win in the midst of those trends.The customer is moving quickly, both in how and where they shop, and those buying behaviours and preferences, and also how and where they discover brands. Those behaviours are changing, which requires companies to stay very close to the customer so that you can move with the customer, but also, [understand] what they value. I'm not sure [their values are] changing, but their values are coming to the surface, so they want to align with brands whose values reflect their own, and this sense of authenticity in a brand is critically important.Story continuesConsumers today are more omni-connected, so having a digital presence and capabilities to deliver an experience for a consumer that's authentic to your brand and consistent across different channels is also critically important.Gen-Z is the growth engine of the luxury industry at the moment. What are the most common mistakes that brands make when trying to engage this cohort?It's a cohort that is very discerning about what is really true about a brand and what isn't. It is so important to really represent your true values and understand where you have the right to play, because it can't be surface level.The other aspect for this cohort that we're learning [is] their desire for self-expression. They want to express their individuality. This is a place where we're also leaning in. As we've developed and thought about how our brands fit in with their lifestyle, it is really to unlock this self-expression. In fact, as we think about this next phase of growth for Coach, we're moving from what was once called ""accessible luxury,"" which was really about luxury at an accessible price point, to the concept of ""expressive luxury,"" where we're more inclusive in our price point, but allowing our consumer to express their individuality through our brands.How do you see the potential for alternative business models to create new revenue streams or opportunities? Coach is expanding its Reloved resale programme at the moment; how do you see that business evolving?We've always done repairs and refinishing and refurbishing work, so it was a natural extension of our history to test this idea of bringing the Reloved product into our stores. We saw a tremendous response, so we've been building those capabilities to make it even bigger.To scale this opportunity, we're now taking back handbags at all of our retail locations in the US. We're having to hire more leather craftsmen to help refurbish and repair because the volumes are going up. We started an apprentice programme, to help build and train new craftsmen in this space.Interestingly, it has also informed a new business model that we're pursuing, called Coachtopia. It is a completely circular business model, and we're building product in Coachtopia with circularity in mind from the beginning.There are new techniques in terms of bringing this product to market with full circularity in mind. Regenerative agriculture; we're using and leveraging sustainable materials, including regenerative leather; but also techniques in terms of making a handbag with consideration for end-of-life ""unmaking"" of a handbag. As we learn about those techniques through Coachtopia, we can bring them into the main brand and make it better and more sustainable.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.tapestry.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/730907/Resilience-and-Circularity-Among-Key-Focuses-in-2023-for-Tapestry]"

247,95d47778-f244-3443-8bc6-7380741a4948,MCK,2022-12-09,Masimo (MASI) W1 Watch With Hi to Improve Patient Outcome,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masimo-masi-w1-watch-hi-170605131.html,1670519165,STORY,"['MASI', 'AMN', 'MCK']","[Masimo Corporation MASI recently announced the full-market release of the Hydration Index (Hi) for the Masimo W1 watch. Hi was first announced earlier this year in a limited market release, which is expected to provide an index that tracks an individual’s hydration levels.In the same press release, Masimo announced that a medical version of Masimo W1 would be available outside the United States for use in telehealth and telemonitoring applications via Masimo SafetyNet and Personal SafetyNet for healthcare providers and payers along with individual use.However, it is worth mentioning that the Masimo W1 and Hi, which have not yet received the FDA’s clearance, are not available for use in medical applications in the United States.The latest full-market release is expected to significantly strengthen Masimo’s remote patient monitoring (RPM) business across the world.Few Words on Masimo W1The Masimo W1 highlights the company’s strength and expertise in signal processing, photonics and bio-sensing and provides the same to consumers looking to control their personal health, make better health decisions and monitor their overall physiological status. Masimo W1 pairs with the Masimo Health smartphone app via secure Bluetooth to unlock meaningful and actionable insights.The integrated Personal SafetyNet subscription service provides users access to sophisticated reporting tools to help them review their physiological status over time. It also facilitates sharing data with family members and in some cases with healthcare providers (where allowed).Significance of the ReleaseHydration level has been one of the most sought parameters by athletes, among others, who seek to optimize their performance. Proper hydration has been widely recognized as an important aspect of health and performance, and lack of proper hydration may affect many physiological parameters as the body works to restore homeostasis (a state of balance among all the body systems needed for the body to survive and function correctly). Masimo W1 has been designed to help users identify their hydration baseline and understand hydration level. This is useful as it can support healthier lifestyle decisions.Story continuesThe Masimo W1, an advanced health-tracking wearable, is currently the first watch to offer continuous pulse oximetry measurements and insightful health data. Hi is expected to provide an index that tracks an individual’s hydration levels and integrate effortlessly with other continuous Masimo W1 health data, such as oxygen saturation and pulse rate, among others.Per an expert familiar with the Masimo W1, assessing intravascular volume status is a common issue in clinical care, mostly for post-op patients and those with complicated chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF). These patients often seek care in the emergency department for monitoring and treatment. Masimo W1 will likely aid individuals in understanding their hydration level by tracking their Hi and provide a common additional monitoring endpoint beyond daily weights for the evaluation of hydration. Additionally, having continuous, non-invasive monitoring of Hi via a wearable device will likely enable people to access crucial real-time information at home. This can transform the management of post-op patients and chronic conditions like CHF.Management believes that Masimo W1 with Hi will likely aid everyone to make healthier decisions.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global RPM system market was valued at $3.8 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $16.9 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 18.3%. Factors like the recent pandemic, the increasing geriatric population and the cost-effectiveness of the treatment are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the recent full-market release is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Masimo announced the findings of a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial where researchers assessed the impact of non-invasive and continuous hemoglobin monitoring with Masimo SpHb on blood transfusion management for adult patients undergoing elective major surgery with anticipated blood loss of 20% or more.Also in November, Masimo announced its third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and bottom lines beating expectations. The company’s robust uptick in the top line and its healthcare business was encouraging. Masimo also recorded robust order shipments and witnessed the solid expansion of its installed base during the reported quarter, which was promising.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 49.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 25% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 17.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

However, headwinds due to third-party reimbursement policies and overdependence on diagnostic tests persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 31.4% compared with the industry’s 45.4% fall and the S&amp;P 500's 18.4% decline.The renowned rapid diagnostic testing solutions provider has a market capitalization of $6.1 billion. QuidelOrtho’s earnings yield of 14.7% compares favorably with the industry’s negative yield. QuidelOrtho’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other, the average surprise being 60.13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s products, which are sold directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional as well as individual, non-professional and over-the-counter (OTC) use. The company has also begun to reach significant new markets as it introduced its QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID test following the reopening of schools and at many other locations.Product Launch: We are upbeat about numerous product launches by QuidelOrtho over the past few months. In August, the company confirmed that it had launched seven new assets globally in its labs business unit. The most notable was the U.S. launch of hemoglobin A1c, which has been registering very strong demand and significant opportunities in QuidelOrtho’s sales funnel. The company expects to continue launching new products in the United States for the rest of 2022.Strong Q3 Results: QuidelOrtho ended the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. Its robust overall top-line performance, driven by POC and Donor Screening product lines, was impressive. The company recorded strong revenues in the majority of its geographies at CER, excluding COVID revenues. Continued strength in QuidelOrtho’s comprehensive product portfolio and expanded global commercial footprint also raise optimism about the stock. The progress made by the company regarding the integration of its QuidelOrtho business is also promising.Story continuesDownsidesThird-Party Reimbursement Policies: The end users of QuidelOrtho’s Point-of-Care products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers. In the United States, healthcare providers, like hospitals and physicians, who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure. The use of QuidelOrtho’s products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of the company’s products from their patients’ third-party payers.Overdependence on Diagnostic Tests: A significant percentage of QuidelOrtho’s revenues comes from the sale of COVID and influenza tests and is expected to remain a significant portion of the company’s total revenues, at least in the near future. As a result, if sales or revenues of COVID or influenza tests fall for any reason, the company’s operating results would be affected.QuidelOrtho Corporation PriceQuidelOrtho Corporation PriceQuidelOrtho Corporation price | QuidelOrtho Corporation QuoteEstimates TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 earnings has improved by 7.9% to $13.42.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $753 million, suggesting an 18.2% improvement from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space areAMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Yet, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations continue to adversely impact Zimmer Biomet's sales. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, Zimmer Biomet has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 3.8% compared with a 44% decline of the industry.Zimmer Biomet, in spite of a difficult macroeconomic scenario in the third quarter, posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of the company’s geographic segments and product divisions, barring S.E.T. and “Other,” recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER.Despite procedure cancellations due to a choppy market situation, strategic execution and business recovery occurred in all the company’s regions, especially in the OUS regions, with both EMEA and APAC performing better than expectations. The Knee franchise grew in high single digits while the hip business grew just above 10%.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteRevenues were driven by continued execution along with strong COVID recovery across most markets. According to the company, strong procedure volume recovery extended from the first quarter, especially as Zimmer Biomet moved into April and May, with a moderation of recovery in June. U.S. sales grew 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in execution as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned, especially in Knee and Hips.An updated adjusted EPS guidance above the Zacks Consensus Estimate buoys optimism.On the flip side, amid the challenging macroeconomic condition, Zimmer Biomet’s reported revenues and adjusted EPS dropped on a year-over-year basis in Q3. The company continued to face significant challenges in terms of unfavorable foreign exchange, supply, inflation and staffing shortage.Story continuesNet sales in the third quarter dropped 0.9% on a reported basis. U.S. sales growth was partially offset by expected declines in S.E.T. and other categories, impacted by tough comparisons in 2021 and pressure around China volume-based procurement, which is expected to reverse in Q4. Further, reimbursement headwinds in the United States and restorative therapies dented revenue growth.

AVNS is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by its impressive product line. A solid third-quarter 2022 performance, along with a continued focus on its Research and Development (R&amp;D), is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and uncertainty in the healthcare industry persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 25.1% compared with a 27.9% decline of the industry and an 18.5% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device solutions provider has a market capitalization of $1.22 billion. The company projects 10.1% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Avanos’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.51%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Portfolio: Avanos’ robust product suite raises our optimism. On its third-quarter 2022 earnings call, Avanos confirmed that it continued to see strong growth in its Digestive Health business, with third-quarter growth being 14% in constant currency. Digestive Health portfolio’s NeoMed grew 39% from the continuation of conversions to Avanos’ ENFit technology amid improving supply. Avanos also confirmed that its pain management arm witnessed growth of nearly 29% compared with the prior-year period.Focus on R&amp;D: We are upbeat about Avanos’ continued focus on its R&amp;D wing to commercialize new products, and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of existing ones. The company has been investing to expand the indications for the use of its pain products with clinical research and studies, as well as associated new product developments. It is also expanding its portfolio with customer-preferred product enhancements.Avanos’ buyout of NeoMed, Inc. was a significant addition to its Digestive Health products portfolio. Avanos’ acquisition of OrthogenRx (in January) is expected to enhance its chronic pain portfolio.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Avanos’ robust third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company saw year-over-year improvement in the overall top and bottom lines. The strength exhibited by Avanos’ core Pain Management segment, along with low single-digit growth in Interventional Pain solutions, is encouraging. The continued strong demand for Digestive Health products and robust sales of NeoMed are promising. The expansion of both margins bodes well.DownsidesUncertainty in Healthcare Industry: Various government authorities periodically review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods. Avanos cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented by the governments or what ultimate effect healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on the company’s customers’ purchasing decisions regarding its products. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for Avanos’ products, reduce medical procedure volumes and affect its business.Competition: Avanos faces significant competition in both the United States and international markets. Competitors of its products are fragmented by particular product categories and the individual markets for these products are also highly competitive. Such an intensely competitive landscape is likely to put pressure on margins.AVANOS MEDICAL, INC. PriceAVANOS MEDICAL, INC. PriceAVANOS MEDICAL, INC. price | AVANOS MEDICAL, INC.

Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead. Air Products also has been benefiting from higher pricing. Higher merchant demand is also driving its volumes.The company’s volumes, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Sep 30, 2022), were driven by new plants, recovery in hydrogen and improved merchant demand. It witnessed improved pricing in the three largest regional segments in the quarter.Air Products, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $11.20-$11.50, indicating a 9-12% year-over-year growth.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$92.55 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney What's The Opportunity In Walt Disney?Good news, investors! Walt Disney is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $141.07, but it is currently trading at US$92.55 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Walt Disney look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Walt Disney. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since DIS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DIS for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DIS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Walt Disney mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

For full-year 2020, DTC revenue came in at $10.55 billion before surging to $16.32 billion in 2021 and $19.56 billion in 2022. Advertising revenue for Disney's DTC unit rose from $2.36 billion in 2020 to $3.73 billion in 2022.The new offering — which comes one month after Netflix's (NFLX) much-anticipated ad-supported debut — costs $7.99 per month, $3 less than the ad-free version of Disney+ which now costs $10.99 per month.The ad load will be conservative at first, roughly 4 minutes of ads per hour or less, according to the company. That's about half of Hulu's 8 minute-per-hour ad load and even less compared to linear television's 15 minute-per-hour standard.Disney added, at least for now, there will be no commercials featuring alcohol or competitor content, as well as no political ads.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.According to a new study by Kantar Research, about 1 in 4 current Disney+ subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version — translating to roughly 46 million of the streamer's total 164 million user base.Rangathan, meanwhile, suggested anywhere from 20% to 30% of the U.S. subscriber base could trade down, although that number could edge higher given the success of Hulu's ad tier.Story continues""Almost 70% to 75% of Hulu's subscriber base is on the ad-supported version, so ads have been a huge hit with Hulu,"" the analyst said. ""I think it's going to be a little bit different with Disney+, but we can expect to see at least a third of the user base convert to that ad-supported product over time.""Industry experts argue offering lower-cost, ad-supported options are still an important hedge against churn — something all streamers want to avoid amid increased competition.Iger's shift toward profitabilityAs Disney looks to leverage its ad tier, recently returned CEO Bob Iger hopes the debut can help soften unfavorable investor sentiment, as Disney shares are off more than 40% since the start of the year.In its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion.Iger, who spoke to employees at a company-wide town hall last week, noted a strategic shift towards profits is currently underway, revealing there are currently no plans to reverse the hiring freeze implemented by Bob Chapek earlier this month as he continues to evaluate Disney's current cost structure.Chief executive officer and chairman of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger and Mickey Mouse look on before ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), November 27, 2017 in New York City.

Now, the move comes as the media giant pulls streaming profitability into focus about how will it shape up against the competition. Well, here to discuss, we have Geetha Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst. Good to see you, Geetha. So with the introduction of this new tier, what do you think this means in terms of the competition and in terms of the price range as well?GEETHA RANGANATHAN: Yes, it's a really interesting move by Disney here. They're hiking up their prices on their premium product by almost 38%. So you're going from about an $8 product to $11. But at the same time, they're giving consumers that option because they're introducing that ad-supported product at $8. So for anybody who kind of feels that pinch, of course, they can spend down to that ad-supported product.And remember, this ad-supported product is not necessarily going to be filled with commercials. They're trying to keep the ad load pretty minimal. It's only four minutes per hour versus the eight minutes that you see on Hulu versus the 15 minutes that you see on linear television. So they're kind of trying to do it in as-- what do I say-- as smooth a way as possible, keeping it very, very-- less intrusive and less disruptive to the viewing experience.AKIKO FUJITA: Geetha, two questions. I mean, how many users are likely to switch over or downgrade to the ad-supported tier? And to what extent is this going to drive additional revenue for Disney?GEETHA RANGANATHAN: Yes, so right now, we have about 165 million subscribers on the Disney+ product. We think, at least in the United States, anywhere from about 20% to 30% of the US subscriber base could look to kind of go down, spend down, or trade down to the ad-supported product.Story continuesBut again, it really-- we have to kind of wait and watch because if you look at Hulu-- and Disney owns Hulu. They own 66% of Hulu. Hulu, actually, if you look at their profile of subscribers, almost 70% or 75% of Hulu subscriber base is on the ad-supported version. So it's been a huge hit-- ads have been a huge hit with Hulu. I think it's going to be a little bit different with Disney+, but I think, again, we can expect to see at least 1/3 of the user base kind of convert to that ad-supported product over time.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, when you compare it to something like Amazon Prime, obviously, they have a different ecosystem that involves shopping and everything else when you get the Prime membership. How does Disney stack up in terms of that and also in terms of global reach? We know that at least for Netflix, they're looking internationally for reach.GEETHA RANGANATHAN: Yeah, so Disney also has an international product. And remember, again, with Disney-- you brought up Amazon Prime, which is a really, really great example. And remember, Disney, just a few months ago, was kind of looking to introduce a product very similar to Amazon Prime and call it Disney Prime, where they would kind of have this membership, not just to their streaming product, but also to kind of merchandise, also entry into their theme parks.So they are also looking to build that ecosystem. We're not really sure where they're going to go with it right now. But arguably, I mean, they have the best content. They have the best streaming content in the industry. They have some great franchises. They have some great IP. So they know that subscribers are going to come.And if you just look at some of the numbers that Disney has posted ever since they launched their product about three years ago, I mean, this is a company that has added about 40, 45 million subscribers year after year on their Disney+ products, so just some staggering growth there. And expect it to grow even further with this new ad-supported tier.In terms of how much revenue they can generate, I think it's going to be a little bit of an early-- a slow ramp, if you will. This is still early days. But they do have a nice template there with the Hulu ad-supported model. So we expect Disney to generate anywhere from about $500 million to even up to a billion dollars in ad-supported revenue on the Disney+ product in their first year of operation. But expect it to be somewhere like $2 to $3 billion going forward in the next two to three years' time.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, you could argue, in some ways, that the timing is right. A lot of families trying to cut costs on the streaming side of things, and this offers an alternative. Geetha Ranganathan, Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst, good to talk to you today.]"

The benchmark dropped 3.6% over the past week, marking the longest losing streak since Oct 12. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has plunged about 3.5% last week in the same time period.Despite the decline, some of the stocks in SPY’s portfolio have risen. These are MarketAxess Holdings Inc. MKTX, Etsy ETSY, Netflix NFLX, Exelon Corporation EXC and Bath &amp; Body Works Inc. BBWI. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with positive estimated earnings growth for the next year.Investors continue to worry over Federal Reserve rate hikes and the prospect of a looming recession. The bouts of latest data — hotter-than-expected ISM services and stronger jobs — have put a damper on hopes that the Federal Reserve would ease the pace of its interest rate hikes amid recent signs of ebbing inflation. Investors had hoped that the Fed might slow the pace of interest rate hikes after cooling inflation data (read: 4 Sector ETFs to Play Upbeat November Jobs Data).The economy added 263,000 jobs in November, marking another strong month of job growth. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, close to a 50-year low, while average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% from the prior month and 5.1% from the year-ago month. Higher wages will add to higher inflation. Meanwhile, business activity jumped the most since March 2021 in November, suggesting that the largest part of the economy remains resilient.

Shares have added about 0.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Akamai Technologies due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Akamai Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates on Top-Line GrowthAkamai reported relatively healthy third-quarter 2022 results with year-year-year growth in revenues despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and adverse currency translation effects. Both the bottom line and top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on solid demand trends.Quarter DetailsGAAP net income in the reported quarter was $108.2 million or 68 cents per share compared with $178.9 million or $1.08 per share in the year-ago quarter. The decline in GAAP earnings despite top-line growth was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $200 million or $1.26 per share compared with $238.9 million or $1.45 per share a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Revenues of $881.9 million increased 2.5% year over year and beat the consensus estimate of $875 million. Growth in the Security and Compute businesses primarily contributed to the top line, which collectively improved 23% year over year. Region-wise, U.S. revenues were $461.1 million, up 2.7% year over year. International revenues were $420.8 million, up 2.3%.By product groups, Security Technology Group revenues were $379.5 million, up 13.4% year over year, driven by growth in the application security business and solid performance from Guardicore. Revenues from Delivery aggregated $393.2 million, down 14.9% owing to non-renewals by some customers and continued deceleration in traffic growth among the largest customers. Compute revenues increased 71.5% year over year to $109.1 million, led by incremental contribution from the Linode acquisition and the addition of improved enterprise capabilities to the compute platform.Non-GAAP operating margin contracted to 28% from 32% in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA declined to $368.5 million from $396 million a year ago for a margin of 42%, down from 46%.Story continuesCash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn the first nine months of 2022, Akamai generated $933.2 million in cash from operating activities compared with $1,017.7 million in the prior-year period. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had $457.8 million in cash and cash equivalents with $681.4 million of operating liabilities. During the reported quarter, Akamai repurchased 1.8 million shares for $163 million at an average price of $90.93 per share.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of 2022, Akamai expects revenues between $890 million and $915 million with incremental contribution from Linode. It expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 27%. Non-GAAP earnings are envisioned in the range of $1.23-$1.30 per share.For 2022, Akamai has narrowed its earlier revenue guidance and expects revenues between $3,580 million and $3,600 million, down from $3,570 million and $3,610 million expected earlier due to uncertain market conditions and challenging macroeconomic conditions. It expects a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of $5.23-$5.30 per share, down from earlier expectations of $5.19-$5.37.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Akamai Technologies has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Akamai Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have added about 1.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ViaSat due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Viasat Misses Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q2Viasat reported weak second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, missing both the bottom-line and top-line estimates.The weaker-than-expected results were attributable to the increased ground network costs for the upcoming ViaSat-3 American Satellite, increased R&amp;D investments, alterations in the product mix and government product shipments that were affected by supply chain issues. Nevertheless, the company is experiencing growth in the IFC (In-Flight Connectivity) business and has received contributions from the recent RigNet and EBI acquisitions.Bottom LineNet loss from continuing operations in the quarter was $72.7 million or a loss of 97 cents per share compared with a net loss of $21.3 million or a loss of 32 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The loss was primarily due to higher provision for income tax expense. The bottom line was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an earnings of 22 cents.RevenuesRevenues improved to $656.7 million from $609.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The growth was backed by higher product and service revenues, up 15% and 4% respectively to $254.9 million and $401.8 million. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $100 million.Segment RevenuesThe Satellite Services generated $300.5 million in revenues - flat year over year as commercial IFC service revenue growth was offset by a decline in fixed broadband revenues due to capacity allocations and fewer residential subscribers. Adjusted EBIDTA decreased 15% to $92 million due to higher ViaSat-3 ground network activation expenditures and lower broadband subscriber base.Story continuesThe Commercial Networks segment generated $180 million in revenues, reflecting growth of 34% from the prior-year quarter due to Acacia payment. Adjusted EBIDTA was $21 million.The Government Systems segment generated $176.1 million in revenues from continuing operations, up 1.1% year over year. Adjusted EBIDTA from continuing operations increased 2% to $41 million due to lower R&amp;D expenses.Other DetailsDuring the quarter, ViaSat reported an operating income of $1.1 million against an operating loss of $24.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBIDTA in the quarter was $188 million compared with $155 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to Acacia payment and higher IFC businesses.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityDuring the first six months of fiscal 2023, ViaSat generated $228.1 million in operating cash flow compared with $227.8 million in the year-ago period. Cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2022, were $149.2 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -596.43% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, ViaSat has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D.

On that day, Comcast is projected to report earnings of $0.79 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 2.6%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $30.69 billion, up 1.17% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.60 per share and revenue of $121.39 billion, which would represent changes of +11.46% and +4.3%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Comcast. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2022.When companies want to raise cash for their businesses, there are two main ways to go about this. The first one is to issue equity and get investment in return. This is why most major companies opt for IPOs or initial public offerings, where shares of the company are issued for a set price initially, which is then dictated by market dynamics. Other times, companies issue right shares which are shares issued to existing shareholders at a specified price. When people start a company, they generally require investment to scale up their ambitions, and these companies are private at the time. They then invite investors and pitch their project and their company and offer a part of their company in exchange for the investment. The best kind of example for this is the TV show Shark Tank, where people who have started companies pitch their idea and financials to get major investors to invest in their companies while also providing expertise gained from decades of experience.Another way to raise money is debt. Debt involves borrowing money, often from banks, to fund operations and paying it back based on a specific term along with interest. There are several reasons that companies may opt for debt rather than equity with the primary one being that taking on debt does not lead to dilution of ownership, thus ensuring that profits stay within the company rather than losing out in the form of interest and principal payments. Debt also helps increase tax savings as interest is an allowable tax expense and hence lowers the profit calculation for tax purposes. Further, debt is generally considered to have a lower finance cost as opposed to equity. Remember, raising equity doesn't mean that there isn't any cost; shareholders are investing as they want the best possible return on their money and so the cost of equity is definitely very real. Also, equity means that shareholders get returns forever while debt is for a limited time period and after the payment of the principal along with interest, no further payments have to be made. For example, if you issue 1% of equity for $100,000 thereby valuing your company at $10 million, the shareholders of the issued equity will be owed 1% forever, while if you got debt of $100,000 for a period of 5 years at an annual interest rate of 10%, with principal paid off in 5 installments at the end of each year, you would have paid back $130,000 in 5 years.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the world are also some of the most indebted companies in the world. The total debt of the 22 most indebted companies globally is more than $2.5 trillion, bigger than most economies in the world. To determine these companies, we considered the total debt of each operation based on its latest annual report, with the data being taken from Yahoo Finance.

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 8, 2022 / Comcast Corporation announced today that Comcast RISE, an initiative created in 2020 to help strengthen and empower small businesses hard hit by COVID-19, has met its goal of supporting 13,000 small businesses nationwide by the program's close at the end of 2022.Comcast RISE is one of several programs that Comcast has overseen as part of Project UP that is aimed at closing the digital divide and achieving digital equity. With the program's commitment now fulfilled, Comcast looks forward to introducing a new phase of Comcast RISE in 2023, which will continue the company's efforts and help an even broader range of small businesses, while continuing to focus on diversity, inclusion, and community investment.To continue highlighting program recipients, Comcast has partnered with Philadelphia-area tech education and training nonprofit Hopeworks to develop and release an interactive map to encourage consumers to patronize Comcast RISE small businesses in their communities.U.S. small businesses were particularly hard hit by the pandemic, which is why Comcast RISE was launched in 2020. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research cited that Black-owned small businesses were hardest hit, suffering the steepest decline (41 percent), followed by Hispanic and Asian American-owned small businesses. In addition, according to a study by the National Association of Women Business Owners, women-owned businesses have been growing at only half the rate of those run by men, namely because women struggle to access capital and other resources to help them succeed.Story continuesComcast RISE was designed to meet that moment, and today's announcement shows that goal was met. In total, Comcast RISE has provided over $110 million in monetary, marketing, and technology grants to 13,000 small businesses owned by women and people of color - including Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, among others.""We recognize that small businesses are the backbone of our economy and look forward to taking our learnings from this program as we find new ways to further empower and strengthen even more small businesses and entrepreneurs at the heart of our local communities. Comcast will be continuing its efforts to positively impact small businesses in 2023. We have seen that many small businesses are shifting from pandemic recovery to long-term growth, so it is only natural for the program to evolve. The next evolution of the program will focus on helping businesses of all types accelerate growth. Its offerings will include complimentary marketing, technology, financial grants, business consulting, entrepreneurship training, and other services,"" said Teresa Ward-Maupin, Senior Vice President, Digital and Customer Experience, Comcast Business.""Comcast RISE has helped me and my business thrive in so many ways. I received the $10,000 grant though the Investment Fund, which provided us with cash to use wherever our needs were,"" said Judi Townsend, Owner and CEO of Mannequin Madness in Oakland, CA. ""This grant allowed me to maintain payroll and supported my evolving business endeavors, such as the expansion of my mannequin business, which now offers a virtual and in-person headpiece workshop.""Comcast recently announced its final round of Comcast RISE recipients, which includes over 2,800 small businesses owned by people of color and women, that will receive a TV campaign, production of a TV commercial or consulting services from Effectv or computer equipment, Internet, voice and cybersecurity from Comcast Business. In addition, as part of round four of the Comcast RISE Investment Fund, 500 more small businesses in Chicago, Miami, Oakland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. will each receive $10,000 grants, bringing the total Comcast RISE Investment Fund recipients to 2,100 and the total dollar amount distributed to $21 million.

According to the companies, the special discounted offer for Peacock Premium “will be extended to additional select DirecTV [satellite] customers in the coming weeks.” In addition, Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) will be available at the standard rate of $9.99/month to both DirecTV and DirecTV Stream subscribers.For DirecTV, which spun off from AT&amp;T last year, the addition of more over-the-top streaming services is an attempt to keep customers who may be on the fence about dropping their pay-TV service. Last week, DirecTV announced a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to offer Discovery+ with ads at the same 40% price discount.“As more DirecTV customers gain interest in [streaming services] from programming partners, including NBCUniversal, we always strive to offer the content our customers want most, using whatever device wherever they are — but also at a strong value they can really appreciate,” Rob Thun, DirecTV chief content officer, said in a statement. “Giving our customers Peacock at an attractive price helps us to accomplish that goal.”Peacock Premium features original series, movies, news and live sports with content from across NBCU and partners. The service has more than 18 million paying subscribers, NBCU CEO Jeff Shell said last week at an investment conference, again citing the recent decision to claw back content rights from Hulu as helping drive up subs.“As Peacock continues to grow, we hope to help extend our pay-tv partners’ businesses by providing additional value to their customers,” commented Matt Bond, NBCU chairman, content distribution. “This is a great opportunity to bring an additive experience to DirecTV subscribers through Peacock’s lineup of exclusive original and sports programming, straight-from-theaters movies and library content.”Story continuesDirecTV had an estimated 13.5 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter 2022, after losing about 400,000 customers, per Leichtman Research Group.DirecTV spun off from AT&amp;T in August 2021 in a deal with TPG Capital. As a privately held company, DirecTV no longer reports financials or subscriber figures. However, like the rest of the pay-TV biz, the operator was seeing steady declines over several years amid the rise in cord-cutting.Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"
273,5e3af29a-a674-33b4-94fd-b875d815f7b1,DVN,2022-12-09,Our 7 Top Energy Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-energy-stock-picks-202209638.html,1670271729,STORY,"['CVX', 'XOM', 'ARRY', 'KMI', 'COP', 'VWS.CO', 'DVN']","[Looking ahead a year is always difficult. Predictions made now are unlikely to accurately reflect the situation 12 months from now. That is even more true in today’s highly volatile markets. That said, Blackrock’s (NYSE:BLK) chief investment officer for U.S. equities, Tony DeSpirito, is bullish on the energy sector. He believes that, because the sector’s earnings growth has outpaced the gains of its share price, it should have a strong year in 2023. So big oil firms, along with other energy plays, should do well in 2023. With that in mind, here are my top energy stock picks for 2023.CVXChevron$175XOMExxon$106KMIKinder Morgan$18.50DVNDevon Energy$66.25COPConocoPhillips$119VWDRYVestas Wind Systems$8.75ARRYArray Technologies$22.10Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) stock had a stellar year in 2022. In 2023, the company may very well generate lower earnings if analysts’ expectations for the sector play out. But that doesn’t mean CVX stock can’t continue to reward investors. Because regardless of the energy market dynamics in 2023, Chevron will continue to be, at worst, a great dividend stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI believe that Chevron’s share price could stabilize in 2023 because, although energy prices probably won’t go up much above their current levels, they shouldn’t drop a great deal either.   Meanwhile, expect CVX to continue to reward investors. In Q3, the firm reported earnings of $11.2 billion. It distributed $6.5 billion of those funds back to shareholders. So Chevron will undoubtedly continue to pay a high dividend in 2023. Right now, the company’s  payout ratio is a low 0.32. That indicates that the firm should be able to continue to pay its dividend without any issues. Further, Chevron hasn’t reduced its dividend since 1988. Relying on Chevron’s dividend for profits is the worst-case scenario for the stock in 2023. That’s arguably a strong worst-case scenario. Story continuesExxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another oil major whose stock is worth buying. Exxon, however, is going to have a difficult time beating its 2022 performance. During Q3, the company achieved its best-ever refining volumes throughout North America and its highest globally since 2008. A significant portion of that record production came from the Permian Basin, where the firm produced 560,000 barrels of oil per day, representing its highest  production ever. Investors should note that Exxon’s share prices don’t tend to correlate particularly well with its earnings. Through the first nine months of 2021, Exxon Mobil reported $14.17 billion of net earnings. Its shares traded around $60 at the end of 2021. XOM stock is currently trading at $107 after its earnings more than tripled in the first nine months of this year to $42.99 billion. The point is that XOM stock can remain high in 2023 even if Exxon’s dynamics aren’t as favorable as they are now. The company’s dividend will help keep its price elevated, and the company’s payout ratio hasn’t been reduced since 1983. I also like the firm’s ability to grow its investments by an annual average of more than 5.5% historically, as measured by its returns and capital costs. The company creates value across changing market conditions. Kinder Morgan (KMI)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comNext year should be an interesting one  for Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), as we will see how the company deals with difficult issues, such as dividends, renewables, and potentially weakening demand for refining. Kinder Morgan is a midstream energy infrastructure firm that operates more than 83,000 miles of pipeline, 141 terminals, and a massive amount of storage storage. There are some indications that Kinder Morgan’s top and bottom lines may not rise or fall much next year. For example, global refining capacity isn’t expected to increase in 2023. As a result, Kinder Morgan’s throughput and storage demand may stagnate, weighing on its share price. But if Kinder Morgan’s stock falls, investors should buy its shares because it will have become an excellent dividend stock due to its high dividend yield. That yield is already above 5.8%., and its dividend probably won’t be reduced in 2023 after the huge profits that the firm generated in 2022. Further, the company is bringing renewable diesel projects online beginning in late 2022 which should make it more interesting as a renewables play. Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comAnalysts’ average price target calls for Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) stock to climb roughly 20% over the coming 12-18 months. That’s encouraging, but investors should be equally interested in the company’s dividend. Devon Energy is a large oil producer with a significant presence in the Delaware basin that stretches from West Texas into New Mexico. The company offers a unique fixed-plus-variable dividend which it instituted in May of 2021. The fixed-plus-variable dividend pays a sustainable, fixed dividend and a variable dividend that is calculated and distributed from its excess free cash flow. Once its fixed dividend is funded, the company can then award up to 50% of its remaining free cash flow in the form of a variable dividend. The company’s dividend increased by 61% this year, reaching $1.35 per share. Since Devon is expected to generate record cash flow through the end of 2022, now is the time to invest in DVN stock to take advantage of its dividend. ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is yet another of my energy stock picks for 2023. Like almost every other oil firm, it has done very well in 2022, as its net income nearly doubled in Q3, reaching $4.527 billion. Through the first nine months of 2022, its net income nearly tripled, coming in at $15.431 billion. For investors, the good news is that ConocoPhillips is returning its wealth to them. In fact, the company just increased its dividend by 11%, to 51 cents per share. On top of that, COP stock has roughly another $20 to go until it reaches analysts’ average prices target. So, despite the shares’ very strong year, they can still advance further. Part of the reason that the company’s price can continue to rise is the fact that it is much more cash-rich now than it was a year ago. Specifically, it now has $8 billion of cash on hand, a roughly $3 billion increase over the same period a year ago. That means ConocoPhillips can withstand whatever 2023 brings. That’s true of all the oil majors on this list and is part of what continues to make them good energy stock picks for 2023.Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)A wind turbine appears in silhouette against a bright orange and blue sky.Source: Khanthachai C / Shutterstock.comVestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWDRY) is an exemplary wind energy company, and VWDRY stock is a great energy stock pick for 2023. Investors are well aware that the energy production landscape is changing and will favor clean-energy sources over the coming decades. In fact, 10.2% of electricity produced in the U.S. is generated from wind, according to American Clean Power, a  “federation of renewable energy companies.” That makes wind energy the largest source of renewable energy. Moreover, wind-power generation is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 18% between 2022 and 2030. That puts Vestas, a Danish producer of wind-power turbines, in a strong position for 2023 and beyond. Further, Vestas’ stock trades below $9 but analysts’ average  price target on it is above $48. Its revenues declined 29% year-over-year last quarter. While that isn’t particularly encouraging, its turbine order backlog is valued at $18.1 billion euros and its services backlog sits at $32.8 billion euros. The company reported 3.9 billion euros of revenue this quarter, so it will be busy for a long time to come. Array Technologies (ARRY)rows of solar panels representing EOSE Stock.Source: Love Silhouette / Shutterstock.comArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) has expanded rapidly in 2022 through acquisitions. As a result, its fundamentals have greatly improved and investing in the solar array maker is worthwhile. Array Technologies completed the acquisition of STI Norland in January, drastically improving its financial standing. Array’s revenues climbed to $515 million in Q3, up from the $188.7 million of sales that it generated during the same period a year earlier. The firm’s acquisition of STI has taken Array Technologies from a company that lost $27.56 million a year ago, to one that posted $40.82 million of net income for Q3. The positive news for investors is that analysts’ average price target on ARRY stock is $5 above its current price. The solar market is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years That alone makes Array Technologies exciting.  Add in its acquisition and turnaround, and ARRY stock is particularly intriguing. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

They need to balance their portfolio’s preservation of capital against generating income on capital. 2022 is an exceptional year for meeting both requirements. Bonds and stocks both fell this year. Since all of the picks have a good value score, those that have strong growth give investors a bonus. Chances are good that companies growing their free cash flow will increase the dividend payout regularly in the years ahead.MOAltria Group$47.50BMOBank of Montreal$97.37BBYBest Buy$84.12BXBlackstone$80.803CMCanadian Imperial Bank$43.13DVNDevon Energy$66.02ORealty Income$62.26Income Stocks to Buy: Altria Group (MO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIn its third quarter, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Its revenue fell slightly by 2.2% to $5.41 billion. Altria also narrowed its growth guidance in the range of 4.5% to 6% from last year. The conservative guidance pleased investors. It gives management the flexibility to react to adverse marketplace conditions ahead.Most importantly, the company has healthy growth to support a steady increase in its dividend. MO stock pays a dividend of $3.76, which yields almost 8%. Altria has novel products in the e-vapor market. Adult smokers may transition to the healthier alternative. They may fulfill their desires and needs as government regulators add further restrictions on the smoking industry. Investor concerns on Altria’s ownership in Juul are winding down. Shareholders are comfortable with the company navigating the regulatory bodies in the heated tobacco space.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIncome Stocks to Buy: Bank of Montreal (BMO)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comBank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) bounced back to around $100, even after posting lower earnings. The Canadian bank also raised its dividend by 3% to CAD 1.43. BMO’s commercial customers are holding up well in the lending segment. They have a strong capital base. Chief Executive Officer Dave Casper said that the bank will see demand drop slightly as the economy weakens. This could extend into the New Year. As the economy enters a recessionary period, BMO is in a strong position. It had strong loan growth in 2022.Story continuesThe bank acquired more clients and benefited from a large increase in its businesses. Investors should expect BMO’s asset-based lending in the auto dealer market to remain strong. The firm manages its risks well. For example, it watches its client’s exposure to risks closely. It is also choosey with the clients it accepts.Income Stocks to Buy: Best Buy (BBY)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockNaysayers who thought that Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) gave consumers a showroom for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) missed out on BBY stock gains. Year-to-date, AMZN stock is down by almost 45%, while BBY stock is down around 15%. Still, Best Buy pays a dividend that yields around 4%.In the third quarter, the retailer posted comparable sales falling by 10.4%. Despite the slowdown, it expects full-year non-GAAP operating income to rise above 4%. Best Buy has a healthy cash flow, which is enough for it to resume its $1 billion stock buyback. Best Buy expects this holiday period to look different from last year. CFO Matt Bilunas said that consumers are shopping less early this year.Fortunately, Nov. sales are similar to historical levels. Shareholders should expect healthy demand for televisions. In addition, virtual reality is a potentially popular item this year. Gaming is an exciting form of entertainment for people. Best Buy offers those customers a chance to explore those goods.Income Stocks to Buy: Blackstone (BX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockBlackstone (NYSE:BX) recently liquidated its stake in MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay Resort. VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) will buy the 49.9% stake. Blackstone will pocket over $700 million, earned in under three years. The sale strengthens the Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust’s liquidity. On Dec. 2, investors grew increasingly concerned about Blackstone’s redemption curb.The firm is limiting redemptions to just 0.3% in December. BREIT investors requested redemptions of $1.8 billion in October or 2.7% of net asset value. Investors may only speculate that Asian holders are withdrawing their holdings. Investors in Asia are facing a credit and real estate bubble. Blackstone has enough liquidity to control the asset redemptions. The value of its real estate portfolio should not change by much. This will attract income investors on BX stock, whose dividend yields 5.8%.Canadian Imperial Bank (CM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockCanadian Imperial Bank (NYSE:CM) shares plunged by around 7% after posting fourth-quarter results. Revenue grew by 6.5% Y/Y to CAD 5.39 billion. However, the provision for credit loss rose to CAD 436 million. This is up by 459% from last year. CIBC said that although PCL is higher, its balance sheet remains strong. It will strengthen its business by focusing on a disciplined deployment of resources. With a CET1 ratio of 11.7%, CIBC may generate internal capital through its exposure to growth in risk-weighted assets.The bank’s expenses are growing in the mid-single digit percentage. From 2023 through 2025, CIBC is confident that it can grow its bottom line and deliver on positive operating leverage. For example, it has the flexibility to strengthen revenue by increasing fees. In the mortgage sector, the bank achieved a deeper relationship with 92% of its client base. In the commercial loan market, CIBC expects growth from its U.S. segment.Devon Energy (DVN)dividend stocks ceSource: ShutterstockDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is one of the best energy firms to own. The company posted revenue growing by 56.5% Y/Y to $5.43 billion in Q3. This sets up strong momentum for Q4 beating market expectations. CEO Rick Muncrief targets conservative growth in the range of 0% to 5% in Q4. Chances are good that the company will exceed that goal. It is a multi-basin operator that is testing new zones. This will result in higher operating income in the next few years. DVN stock pays a dividend of $5.17, which yields 7.55%.Devon could raise its dividend after completing opportunistic transactions that strengthen its cash flow. It is unlikely to overpay for assets, which protects investors from excess risks. In 2023, Devon will benefit from an increase in well spud counts. In addition, its acquisition activities will add meaningfully to results. Strong oil prices will lift Devon’s free cash flow. To offset higher taxes, it has a net operating loss carry forward of around $1 billion.Realty Income (O)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) carries a dividend yield of 4.73% at the moment. With its high investment-grade assets, the grocery segment moved the most. Conversely, in Realty Income’s higher-yielding assets, the cap rate moved by less. Fortunately, the company has good relationships with clients. This results in responsive management of the cost of capital.On the industrial side, cap rates are moving significantly. For example, Amazon is canceling plans to take industrial assets. Fortunately, Realty Income has a diverse portfolio of assets to minimize shareholder risks. To broaden its sector exposure, the company completed its acquisition of Encore Boston Harbor. This marks Realty’s first ownership in the gaming industry. Investors should expect management’s historically strong performance to keep its dividend growing.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

J has received an energy contract from the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to support its fusion energy research program. J has been appointed to all lots of the new Plant Maintenance and Operational Support Services (PMOSS) framework.UKAEA is the U.K.'s national fusion laboratory, which aims to realize the huge potential of fusion for generating safe, sustainable and low-carbon electricity. Jacobs' project delivery professionals will be able to work on some of the world's most advanced research into machine design, robotics, materials science and fusion fuel.Jacobs’ Energy Security and Technology’s senior vice president, Karen Wiemelt, stated, ""Fusion power would be a new source of safe, non-carbon emitting and almost limitless energy, which makes this endeavor one of the keys to creating a more connected, sustainable world.""Within the PMOSS framework, Jacobs' specialists will also support other UKAEA facilities, like Remote Applications in Challenging Environments, which tests and designs robotic and remote solutions; the Material Research Facility, which researches specialist materials that can withstand extreme conditions; and the Fusion Technology Facility, at Culham and Rotherham, which will test fusion components in realistic conditions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn Dec 7, J’s shares inched up 0.68% post-news release.

Over decades, it has supported UKAEA-managed Joint European Torus and ITER. Growth in fusion research is creating new opportunities for Jacobs' engineers in various disciplines, including electrical, control and instrumentation, process plants, mechanical, chemical and nuclear; and for scientists specializing in chemistry, physics and materials.Efficient project execution has been a primary factor driving Jacobs’ performance over the last few quarters. The company’s solid backlog level is a testimony to this fact. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, J reported a backlog of $27.9 billion, up 5% year over year. This reflects the persistent and solid demand for Jacobs' consulting services.Of this backlog, Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) accounted for $10.56 billion, slightly down from a year-ago figure. Despite a slight decrease in backlog, the segment is benefiting from well-funded government programs and cyber, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), mission-IT, space, nuclear and 5G-related projects.People &amp; Places Solutions’ (P&amp;PS) backlog at fiscal third quarter-end was $17 billion, up from $15.74 billion a year ago. The P&amp;PS segment’s overall sales pipeline has increased as both life sciences and electronics customers have moved forward with previously paused projects.Jacobs’ Focus 2023 initiative entails more than $200 million in benefits versus fiscal 2020.

When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is United Rentals (URI). URI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.57, which compares to its industry's average of 12.41. Over the last 12 months, URI's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.80 and as low as 7.49, with a median of 9.75.Investors should also note that URI holds a PEG ratio of 0.53. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. URI's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.45. Within the past year, URI's PEG has been as high as 0.87 and as low as 0.43, with a median of 0.55.Finally, we should also recognize that URI has a P/CF ratio of 5.89. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 15.06. Over the past 52 weeks, URI's P/CF has been as high as 8.25 and as low as 4.44, with a median of 5.99.Story continuesValue investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that United Rentals is likely undervalued currently.

URI acquires the assets of family-owned Ahern Rentals, Inc. for an all-cash deal which is valued at $2 billion. This buyout has expanded the capacity for United Rentals in key geographies, with concentrations on both U.S. coasts and in the Gulf region.Shares of United Rentals gained 1.2% on Dec 7, 2022.Matthew Flannery, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, “The integration is off to a strong start, giving us significantly more capacity to serve our expanded customer base. This transaction strengthens our positioning for the robust demand we expect in 2023, while also aligning with our longer-term strategy to ‘grow the core’ to drive greater shareholder value.""Buyout SynergiesAhern Rentals is the eighth-largest North American equipment rental company, serving approximately 44,000 customers in the construction and industrial sectors. It operates across 106 locations in 30 states and generated $310 million of adjusted EBITDA on $887 million of total revenue during the trailing 12 months that ended Sep 30, 2022.The combined entity will enhance the fleet available to United Rentals customers by more than 60,000 rental assets with an original cost of $1.85 billion and approximately $145 million of the non-rental fleet. Again, more than 75% of Ahern Rentals’ rental fleet is comprised of high-demand aerial and material handling equipment. Notably, the company will provide its 2023 guidance in January 2023, reflecting the financial impact of the buyout.As earlier mentioned by the company, URI will be pausing its $1.25 billion share repurchase program during the early stages of its Ahern integration and expects to realize $60 million of annual revenue synergies by three years, driven by the cross-selling of its specialty rental offerings to an expanded customer base.Share Price PerformanceURI shares have gained 5.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 23.9% decline.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2022.When companies want to raise cash for their businesses, there are two main ways to go about this. The first one is to issue equity and get investment in return. This is why most major companies opt for IPOs or initial public offerings, where shares of the company are issued for a set price initially, which is then dictated by market dynamics. Other times, companies issue right shares which are shares issued to existing shareholders at a specified price. When people start a company, they generally require investment to scale up their ambitions, and these companies are private at the time. They then invite investors and pitch their project and their company and offer a part of their company in exchange for the investment. The best kind of example for this is the TV show Shark Tank, where people who have started companies pitch their idea and financials to get major investors to invest in their companies while also providing expertise gained from decades of experience.Another way to raise money is debt. Debt involves borrowing money, often from banks, to fund operations and paying it back based on a specific term along with interest. There are several reasons that companies may opt for debt rather than equity with the primary one being that taking on debt does not lead to dilution of ownership, thus ensuring that profits stay within the company rather than losing out in the form of interest and principal payments. Debt also helps increase tax savings as interest is an allowable tax expense and hence lowers the profit calculation for tax purposes. Further, debt is generally considered to have a lower finance cost as opposed to equity. Remember, raising equity doesn't mean that there isn't any cost; shareholders are investing as they want the best possible return on their money and so the cost of equity is definitely very real. Also, equity means that shareholders get returns forever while debt is for a limited time period and after the payment of the principal along with interest, no further payments have to be made. For example, if you issue 1% of equity for $100,000 thereby valuing your company at $10 million, the shareholders of the issued equity will be owed 1% forever, while if you got debt of $100,000 for a period of 5 years at an annual interest rate of 10%, with principal paid off in 5 installments at the end of each year, you would have paid back $130,000 in 5 years.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the world are also some of the most indebted companies in the world. The total debt of the 22 most indebted companies globally is more than $2.5 trillion, bigger than most economies in the world. To determine these companies, we considered the total debt of each operation based on its latest annual report, with the data being taken from Yahoo Finance. Where the numbers were in a currency other than USD, we used the latest exchange rates for conversion.Image by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay22.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.04 billion, indicating a16.19% increase on a year-over-year basis.Oracle expects non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) growth rate on a year-over-year basis in the range of 1-5% at cc and in the band of $1.16-$1.20 per share due to currency headwinds. The non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to decline between 1% and 5% and be between $1.16 and $1.20 in USD.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at $1.17 per share in the past 30 days, suggesting a 3.3% decline from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Over the trailing four quarters, Oracle’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and missed the mark twice with the average surprise being 3.36%.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderAccelerated digital transformation along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter.The acquisition of Cerner earlier in 2022 in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, the biggest ever for Oracle, is expected to bolster the company’s position in the lucrative healthcare domain.For the fiscal second quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency and from 42% to 46% in USD.Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management (“HCM”) solutions along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) and Fusion ERP applications is expected to have favored ORCL’s quarterly performance.In the last reported quarter, Oracle’s Cloud services and license support revenues (73% of total revenues) in the reported quarter increased 14% year over year (up 20% at cc) to $8.41 billion. The upside was driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) services.The migration of several large-scale SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and increasing deal wins in several verticals, especially banking and healthcare, might have acted as tailwinds for the company’s ERP business.In the fiscal first quarter, management noted that revenues from Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM and NetSuite ERP were up 38%, 26% and 30%, respectively.The robust adoption of Oracle’s next-generation autonomous database and Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud, supported by machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, might have benefited the top line. Autonomous database in Gen2 public cloud infrastructure is witnessing healthy traction.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s latest Multiple-VM Autonomous Database on Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer service offering is gaining considerable traction among on-premises clients. Multiple-VM Autonomous Database enables organizations to create and run isolated, highly available Autonomous Database instances on Exadata Cloud@Customer systems that are also running non-autonomous Oracle Databases. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Oracle’s partnership with VMware VMW over Oracle Cloud VMware Solution is gaining prominence, which is expected to have aided customer growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Oracle VMware Solution provides a faster route to the cloud, providing predictability, security and control of on-premise VMware workloads. The solution gained popularity among leading enterprises in retail, telecommunication, finance and banking, manufacturing, government and others.Strength in the Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain &amp; Manufacturing solution, integrated with new capabilities that help companies foster innovation and improve decision-making, is expected to contribute to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Higher expenses on product development, especially increased investment in cloud platform, might have dented the fiscal fourth-quarter performance. Intense competition in the cloud computing market from the likes of Amazon Web Services, Azure platform and Google Cloud might also have limited margin expansion.Story continuesQ2 HighlightsOracle and NVIDIA NVDA announced a multi-year partnership to help customers solve business challenges with accelerated computing and AI. The collaboration aims to bring the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack—from GPUs to systems to software—to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). OCI is adding tens of thousands more NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100, to its capacity.The company renewed a strategic agreement with AT&amp;T T that will help give new capacity and capabilities for the latter’s database and application workloads running in Oracle Cloud.

284,187fee30-d8bf-3483-badd-cb5e6a081cca,MU,2022-12-09,"With 81% institutional ownership, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-institutional-ownership-micron-technology-110113363.html,1670583673,STORY,['MU'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Micron Technology, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Micron Technology?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Micron Technology. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Micron Technology's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Micron Technology. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Capital Research and Management Company and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 7.7%.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Micron TechnologyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Micron Technology, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$188m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Micron Technology. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Micron Technology has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our detailed industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Biggest Duty Free Companies in the World.One of the worst affected industries after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was the tourism industry. Some countries imposed outright travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus, while others took a measured approach in imposing intermittent lockdowns to contain the pandemic. In 2020, the tourism industry lost 62 million jobs worldwide, leaving the total number of people employed at 271 million. The effect of coronavirus was visible in the retail sales of some of the world’s leading airports.However, things improved in 2021 as countries started moving towards a more normal environment as shutdowns were lifted across the globe. The travel and tourism industry's share in the global GDP went up by $1 trillion in 2021, an increase of 21.7% as compared with 2020. The businesses associated with the tourism sector also saw a boost, including duty free retail stores.The surge in tourism along with the rising urbanization and social developments are anticipated to fuel market expansion. Furthermore, the improvement in economic conditions and increment of discretionary income of middle-class groups paired with technological advancements are creating even more opportunities for the duty free market to grow. The credit for this goes to the ease of availing transportation, booking hotels, and acquiring other necessities through online portals.An Analysis of the Duty Free IndustryDuty free retail is a key revenue generator within the aviation and tourism industry. There are numerous reasons why people love shopping in duty free stores. The most obvious reason is the discounted prices that are offered at these stores. However, many consumers also love shopping in duty free stores because they want to collect a souvenir from their trip. This is why duty-free shops are now an integral part of the tourism industry.Story continuesThe duty free retail market was valued at $35.8 billion in 2021. As the world recovers from the adverse impacts of COVID-19 shutdowns, the duty free retail market is forecasted to grow at a healthy pace at a CAGR of 9.17% during 2022-2029, increasing in value from $39.08 billion in 2022 to $72.3 billion by 2029.Now that companies are opting for technological features to improve the customer shopping experience, this can give a huge push to the global duty free market. One such example of technology is AR (Augmented Reality) which will allows travelers to save time by being able to better navigate through the shops to their desired items. The technology will also create a virtual real-life environment where they’ll be able to engage with the products to have a better view of what they are actually buying. The technology is already being used by many retailers such as IKEA, Macy’s, and Kohl’s. In 2019, L’Oréal Travel Retail Asia Pacific teamed up with Lotte Duty Free to launch an augmented reality make-up try-on facility called ModiFace on Lotte’s website. Recently, Istanbul Airport has also introduced AR to improve the shopping experience of travelers.The APAC region is expected to lead global growth in the duty free retail industry, with an estimated contribution of 44% of the market's growth during 2022-2026. The market growth in this region is expected to be faster than that of the market in European, South American, and MEA regions with China and Japan being the main contributors to the market in this region. The growth of duty free retailing in the APAC region will be primarily driven by the boom in the travel and tourism sector and the growing number of new international connections.Amid the boom in the travel industry and rising foot traffic at duty free shops, companies like Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), which have presence at almost every major airport, remain the biggest beneficiaries.Our MethodologyTo compile this list, we have ranked the duty free retail companies according to their annual revenue from #10 to #1.10.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Prologis'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Prologis How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Prologis seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Prologis' decent 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Prologis' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PLD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Prologis Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Prologis has a high three-year median payout ratio of 51%. This means that it has only 49% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings by a fair bit, as we saw above.Moreover, Prologis is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 58% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Prologis' future ROE will drop to 6.6% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Prologis' performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

(UPS) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-united-parcel-140002258.html,1670508002,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned +6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UPS is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.91 points to a change of +6.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.22 indicates a change of -5.4% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $28.09 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.2%. The $101.4 billion and $99.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.2% and -1.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $24.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.2%. EPS of $2.99 for the same period compares with $2.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yet, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations continue to adversely impact Zimmer Biomet's sales. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, Zimmer Biomet has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 3.8% compared with a 44% decline of the industry.Zimmer Biomet, in spite of a difficult macroeconomic scenario in the third quarter, posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of the company’s geographic segments and product divisions, barring S.E.T. and “Other,” recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER.Despite procedure cancellations due to a choppy market situation, strategic execution and business recovery occurred in all the company’s regions, especially in the OUS regions, with both EMEA and APAC performing better than expectations.

PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteRevenues were driven by continued execution along with strong COVID recovery across most markets. According to the company, strong procedure volume recovery extended from the first quarter, especially as Zimmer Biomet moved into April and May, with a moderation of recovery in June. U.S. sales grew 1.3% driven by a strong recovery in execution as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned, especially in Knee and Hips.An updated adjusted EPS guidance above the Zacks Consensus Estimate buoys optimism.On the flip side, amid the challenging macroeconomic condition, Zimmer Biomet’s reported revenues and adjusted EPS dropped on a year-over-year basis in Q3. The company continued to face significant challenges in terms of unfavorable foreign exchange, supply, inflation and staffing shortage.Story continuesNet sales in the third quarter dropped 0.9% on a reported basis. U.S. sales growth was partially offset by expected declines in S.E.T. and other categories, impacted by tough comparisons in 2021 and pressure around China volume-based procurement, which is expected to reverse in Q4.

300,f2b2db59-7e07-356e-89ab-f26bf7f66dde,RMD,2022-12-09,"ResMed Inc.'s (NYSE:RMD) recent 3.5% pullback adds to one-year year losses, institutional owners may take drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resmed-inc-nyse-rmd-recent-143150265.html,1670509910,STORY,['RMD'],"[A look at the shareholders of ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.5% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 16% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell ResMed, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of ResMed, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for ResMed ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ResMed?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that ResMed does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see ResMed's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in ResMed. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.2% and 5.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ResMedWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of ResMed Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$301m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over ResMed. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for ResMed  you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

ULTA, Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Five Below, Inc. FIVE, Arhaus, Inc. ARHS and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. BBW.Industry: Miscellaneous RetailLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2026730/5-stocks-worth-a-look-in-the-promising-retail-miscellaneous-industryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry participants have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments to strike the right chord with consumers. Ulta Beauty, Inc., Tractor Supply Company, Five Below, Inc., Arhaus, Inc. and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure.However, product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the industry have been encountering. Notwithstanding inflationary pressure, the retail sector takes center stage with the arrival of the holiday season.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, arts and crafts specialty outlets, and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses.The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, well-organized supply chain and effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry TrendsConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. The players in the industry have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. We believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate should help keep the demand alive this holiday season.Per the National Retail Federation, holiday retail sales during the November and December period are anticipated to improve in the band of 6-8% over the last year to $942.6-$960.4 billion. We note that retail sales rose 1.3% on a sequential basis in the month of October.Focus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companies’ initiatives to expand delivery options — curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders — and contactless payment solutions have been a boon.Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with high labor costs amid the tight labor market, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues.

Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Five Below, Inc. FIVE, Arhaus, Inc. ARHS and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. BBW look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure.However, product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the industry have been encountering. Notwithstanding inflationary pressure, the retail sector takes center stage with the arrival of the holiday season.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, arts and crafts specialty outlets, and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, well-organized supply chain and effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry TrendsConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. The players in the industry have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. We believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate should help keep the demand alive this holiday season. Per the National Retail Federation, holiday retail sales during the November and December period are anticipated to improve in the band of 6-8% over the last year to $942.6-$960.4 billion. We note that retail sales rose 1.3% on a sequential basis in the month of October.Story continuesFocus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companies’ initiatives to expand delivery options — curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders — and contactless payment solutions have been a boon. Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with high labor costs amid the tight labor market, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail–Wholesale sector.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures fell $2.24 (or 3%) to settle at $72.01 a barrel yesterday.Despite this, the market has been kind to oil in 2022, with commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $130 for the first time since 2008. Crude-related stocks like Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.2 million barrels compared to expectations of a 2.6 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of lower imports and continued strength in refinery demand accounted for the bigger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production climbed to the highest since August.Total domestic stocks now stand at 413.9 million barrels — 4.4% less than the year-ago figure and 9% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 373,000 barrels to 23.9 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 25.7 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.7 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the fourth time in as many weeks. The 5.3 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to lower exports. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 2.9 million barrels. At 219.1 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is essentially in line with the year-earlier level, while it is 3% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the fourth week in succession. The 6.2 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 1.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 118.8 million barrels — are 6.2% below the year-ago level and 9% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at a more than three-year high of 95.5%, rose 0.3% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 53% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17.5%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 120.6%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 282% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $58.3 billion.Hess Corporation: Hess shares have appreciated 82.1% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 229.7% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $41.8 billion, enjoys a Growth Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 70.3% in 2022.

309,ef33256c-c381-3ac5-bc07-b9c2feb81967,BSX,2022-12-09,Perrigo (PRGO) Down 1.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perrigo-prgo-down-1-5-163004842.html,1670517004,STORY,"['PRGO', 'BSX']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Perrigo (PRGO). Shares have lost about 1.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Perrigo due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Q3 Earnings and Sales Miss EstimatesPerrigo reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents. However, earnings were up 24.4% year over year. Unfavorable currency movements and higher operating expenses hurt earnings in the quarter, which was offset by strategic pricing initiatives undertaken by management. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 44.4%.Net sales increased 5.5% year over year to $1.10 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, earnings rose 12.3%. The upside was driven by sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma, strong demand for cough/cold products globally and higher demand for infant formula in the United States. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and divested Latin American businesses. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 7.7% year over year.Segment DiscussionCSCA: Net sales of the segment in the third quarter of 2022 came in at $722.3 million, up 4% year over year. Sales increased due to strategic price increases, strong demand for store-brand infant formula and new product launches.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $377.9 million, up 8.4% from the year-ago period. At constant-currency rates, sales were up 28.6% year over year. Organically sales increased 8.3%. Segment revenues benefitted from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands, strong demand for cough/cold products and Women’s Health products, partially offset by lower sales of products from the Healthy Lifestyle category. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency movement.Story continues2022 Guidance RevisedPerrigo lowered its earnings guidance for 2022. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.00-$2.10, down from the previous guidance of $2.25-$2.35, to account for the worse-than-previously-expected impact of currency translation.Management reaffirmed total revenues in 2022 to grow 8.5%-9.5%. The company also reiterated its guidance for organic growth between 9-10%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.79% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Perrigo has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Perrigo has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPerrigo belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Another stock from the same industry, Boston Scientific (BSX), has gained 8.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Boston Scientific reported revenues of $3.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $0.43 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Boston Scientific is expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

ULTA, Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Five Below, Inc. FIVE, Arhaus, Inc. ARHS and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. BBW.Industry: Miscellaneous RetailLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2026730/5-stocks-worth-a-look-in-the-promising-retail-miscellaneous-industryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry participants have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments to strike the right chord with consumers. Ulta Beauty, Inc., Tractor Supply Company, Five Below, Inc., Arhaus, Inc. and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure.However, product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the industry have been encountering. Notwithstanding inflationary pressure, the retail sector takes center stage with the arrival of the holiday season.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, arts and crafts specialty outlets, and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses.The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, well-organized supply chain and effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry TrendsConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. The players in the industry have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. We believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate should help keep the demand alive this holiday season.Per the National Retail Federation, holiday retail sales during the November and December period are anticipated to improve in the band of 6-8% over the last year to $942.6-$960.4 billion. We note that retail sales rose 1.3% on a sequential basis in the month of October.Focus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companies’ initiatives to expand delivery options — curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders — and contactless payment solutions have been a boon.Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with high labor costs amid the tight labor market, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail–Wholesale sector.

But is it?Tracey and John again look at the important economic data, including the jobs data. One thing that is clear, is that the US economy is currently not in a recession, despite many in the media harping that it is. The US is averaging monthly payroll gains of 392,000 in 2022 through November.And the weekly jobless claims data has yet to show much slowing.Where Should You Invest in 2023?If a recession IS coming next year, where should an investor be hiding out?1.       Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFEThe drug stocks have been popular with investors over the last few years due to the pandemic.Eli Lilly shares are up 32% year-to-date and are breaking out to new 5-year highs. However, analysts have been cutting earnings estimates at Eli Lilly recently. Earnings are expected to fall 4.7% in 2022.Story continuesEli Lilly may be popular with investors, but it’s not cheap. It is trading with a forward P/E of 47.However, the reverse is true of Pfizer. Pfizer is dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.9 but shares have also fallen 17% this year.While Pfizer earnings are expected to be up 46% in 2022, analysts expect them to fall 25% in 2023.Are Eli Lilly and Pfizer the wrong place to be in 2023?2.       JPMorgan Chase JPMWith the Fed raising rates, you’d think that banks like JPMorgan Chase would be a place to hide out in this year, and next.Shares of JPMorgan Chase are down 17% year-to-date, which is mostly in line with the S&amp;P 500, but they have rallied 15% in the last 3 months. John owns JPMorgan Chase in his Large Cap Trader portfolio at Zacks.Yet shares of this big bank are cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.2. JPMorgan Chase also pays a dividend, yielding 3%.Is JPMorgan Chase a deal?3.       Ulta Beauty ULTAUlta Beauty is an American beauty retailer, with both brick and mortar and online sales.

But is it?Tracey and John again look at the important economic data, including the jobs data. One thing that is clear, is that the US economy is currently not in a recession, despite many in the media harping that it is. The US is averaging monthly payroll gains of 392,000 in 2022 through November.And the weekly jobless claims data has yet to show much slowing.Where Should You Invest in 2023?

Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Tractor Supply Company TSCO, Five Below, Inc. FIVE, Arhaus, Inc. ARHS and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. BBW look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure.However, product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the industry have been encountering. Notwithstanding inflationary pressure, the retail sector takes center stage with the arrival of the holiday season.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, arts and crafts specialty outlets, and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, well-organized supply chain and effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry TrendsConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. The players in the industry have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. We believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate should help keep the demand alive this holiday season. Per the National Retail Federation, holiday retail sales during the November and December period are anticipated to improve in the band of 6-8% over the last year to $942.6-$960.4 billion. We note that retail sales rose 1.3% on a sequential basis in the month of October.Story continuesFocus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companies’ initiatives to expand delivery options — curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders — and contactless payment solutions have been a boon. Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with high labor costs amid the tight labor market, increased freight costs and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail–Wholesale sector.

316,cca8bdba-aa0f-3e61-a99e-151e7aca4fa6,ULTA,2022-12-09,Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-hits-141502896.html,1670508902,STORY,"['ULTA', 'BBW']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $480.57 in the previous session. Ulta Beauty has gained 16.4% since the start of the year compared to the -25.1% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the -13% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on December 1, 2022, Ulta reported EPS of $5.34 versus consensus estimate of $4.09.For the current fiscal year, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $22.66 per share on $9.94 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $24.05 per share on $10.72 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.11% and 7.89%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUlta may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ulta has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20.7X versus its peer group's average of 6.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.54. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ulta currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ulta fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ulta shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does ULTA Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ULTA have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is BuildABear Workshop, Inc. (BBW). BBW has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of C.Earnings were strong last quarter. BuildABear Workshop, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 34.21%, and for the current fiscal year, BBW is expected to post earnings of $3.21 per share on revenue of $460.4 million.Shares of BuildABear Workshop, Inc. have gained 50.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 8.74X and a P/CF of 8.13X.The Retail - Miscellaneous industry is in the top 37% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ULTA and BBW, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drugmaker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Vertex is 73.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.3%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Vertex has an S/TA ratio of 0.58, which means that the company gets $0.58 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.15, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Vertex is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.6% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Vertex have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.Bottom LineVertex has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Vertex is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Vertex currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 65% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VRTXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VRTXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Vertex here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Vertex, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in VRTX?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Vertex, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $14.65.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Vertex. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Vertex may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $1.36 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 5, 2031. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on FLRAAThe aforementioned contract is based on Bell’s V-280 Valor tiltrotor, which was developed and tested as part of the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR TD) program that began in 2013. The V-280 progressed through design, manufacturing, and more than three years of rigorous flight testing that provided extensive data validating the technical and operational advantages of the aircraft for long-range assault missions.The initial contract refines the FLRAA weapon system design, sustainment, digital enterprise, manufacturing, systems integration, flight-testing and airworthiness qualification.What’s Favoring Textron?Countries across the globe have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponry, military helicopters have also been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Textron to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract is an example of that. Such contract wins are likely to boost revenues from the Bell unit.Growth ProspectsThe bumped-up defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunition of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to expand at a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2027 period. This is likely to benefit Textron, with its Bell segment consistently innovating combat helicopters as well as upgrading the existing models to expand in the military rotorcraft market. In March 2022, Bell submitted its final Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) proposal revision to the U.S. Army and expects to receive the contract in October 2022.Story continuesThe growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should also benefit other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business segment provides military and rotary-wing aircraft to U.S. armed forces along with military services and commercial operators in 40 nations. Some of its product ranges include CH-53K, S-92, UH-60 Black Hawk, etc.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.2%. LMT shares have risen 41.1% in the past year.Boeing’s portfolio of helicopters comprises the AH-6 Little Bird, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey and H-47 Chinook aircraft and in-development entrants, which include the MH-139A Grey Wolf and DEFIANT X. Its military rotorcraft is currently used by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as allied defense forces in over 20 countries across the globe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2022 earnings implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure. BA’s shares have moved up 11.8% in the past three months.Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout is a combat-proven, autonomous helicopter system providing real-time intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target-acquisition, laser designation and battle management for tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. It’s available in two variants – MQ-8B Fire Scout and MQ-8C Fire Scout.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. NOC’s shares have rallied 48.4% in the past year.Price PerformanceShares of Textron have lost 2.5% in the past year against the industry’s rise of 4.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith similar product catalogs, it raises a valid but potentially tricky question – which company’s shares currently appear more attractive?Let’s take a deeper dive to get a more evident answer.Share PerformanceBy looking at each company’s share performance, we can see which has seen more bullish action and which investors have preferred to buy.From a longer-term perspective (last five years), PEP shares have tacked on nearly 80% in value vs. KO’s nearly 65% gain. Still, both performances have outpaced the S&amp;P 500’s gain of roughly 63% in the same timeframe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpon shrinking the timeframe to encompass just the last six months of price action, we can see that PEP shares have again outperformed KO shares, up more than 13% vs. Coca-Cola’s 5% gain.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile PepsiCo shares have been stronger across several timeframes, both stocks have provided market-beating returns, undoubtedly a major positive.ValuationOf course, valuation must always be addressed. Currently, PEP shares trade at a 26.9X forward earnings multiple, whereas KO shares currently trade at a 25.6X forward earnings multiple.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBoth values reside above their respective five-year medians and the S&amp;P 500 average, indicating that investors will pay a premium for shares of both companies. Still, KO shares are slightly cheaper than PEP shares.DividendsDividends provide a solid boost to any portfolio, limiting the impact of drawdowns and providing a passive income stream.Impressively, KO and PEP are both Dividend Kings, showing an unparalleled commitment to their shareholders through 50+ consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.Story continuesCurrently, PepsiCo’s annual dividend yields 2.5% vs. KO’s 2.8%, a modest difference.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, there’s a notable difference regarding each company’s dividend growth; PEP’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate handily outpaces KO’s 3.1%. Growth OutlookUndoubtedly important is the growth trajectory of each company. After all, if a company isn’t growing, why would an investor want to buy?Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for PepsiCo's current fiscal year (FY22) indicates Y/Y growth of roughly 8%. And in FY23, earnings are forecasted to tack on a further 7.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding Coca-Cola, earnings are forecasted to climb 6.5% in its current fiscal year (FY22) but decline a marginal 0.4% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo undoubtedly wins this round, with forecasted earnings growth for both its current and next fiscal year.Bottom LineThe Coca-Cola Company KO and PepsiCo PEP are undoubtedly titans in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, with market caps north of $200 billion.Still, with similar operations, investors may be left wondering which company’s shares would provide a better bang for their buck.In this heavyweight battle, PepsiCo appears to come out on top. Here’s why: the company carries stronger dividend growth, a more robust earnings outlook, and PEP shares have been visibly stronger across several timeframes.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

324,1a471690-26fe-328d-aa50-92929c37c86d,KO,2022-12-09,"A 449,000% Return: Lessons From the Most Successful Investor You've Never Heard Of",Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/449-000-return-lessons-most-182429344.html,1670523869,STORY,['KO'],"[At age 51, Anne Schieber was broke and disillusioned.She had worked for the IRS for 23 years and was regarded as one of the agency’s top auditors.But she never got promoted and never earned more than $3,150 in a year.With half her life already behind her, her retirement prospects looked bleak. But Schieber had learned a powerful secret from years of studying the tax returns of America’s richest residents.Over the next 50 years, it earned her a 449,000% return — making Schieber one of the most successful investors of all time.The Investing Secret That Beat Berkshire Hathaway’s ReturnsDuring her 23 years at the IRS, Schieber saw firsthand how the stock market can create and compound wealth.And she went on to experience it firsthand.Starting at age 51 with just $5,000, Schieber turned it into over $22 million — a rate of return that beats the average annual gain of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.This feat places her among the greats of investing lore. But beyond the rate of return, Schieber’s story is amazing for another reason.At age 41, Schieber had lost her life savings in the stock market. The loss caused a permanent rift in her family and lasting bitterness toward her brother, who had presided over the debacle.Schieber seemed to take away two lessons from the experience.One, she would never leave her portfolio to outside management again. In 1951, with her $5,000 in savings, she began building a portfolio on her own.And two, she would never again bet the farm on a single opportunity, as she had on her brother’s firm before disaster struck.Beating Warren Buffett to His Greatest Investment — By 31 YearsOver the years, Schieber invested in a number of companies in industries ranging from entertainment to technology.She made her last stock purchase — 100 shares of Apple Inc. and MCI Inc. — in 1985.Schieber bought Apple stock 31 years before Buffett first acquired his shares in 2016.She also bought Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) shares years before Buffett’s famous 1988 investment.Story continuesThose two investments are regarded as perhaps the shrewdest investments Buffett has made in his career. Coca-Cola stock has returned over 2,000% since Buffett bought it 33 years ago. And in February 2020, Buffett called Apple “probably the best business I know in the world.”But an unassuming woman who stood at just 5 feet tall managed to beat him to both of those companies by years.Finding the Next AppleYou may be thinking Schieber got lucky by striking gold on a few investments like Apple and Coca-Cola out of hundreds of different stocks she bought over the decades.But that’s exactly the point. By targeting hundreds of different companies over time, Schieber was able to maximize her chances of backing a company that would return 10,000% or more over the years.Diversification is usually thought of as a defensive strategy. But Silicon Valley insiders use it as an offensive weapon that allows them to swing for the fences, knowing that a single 10,000% winner can more than outweigh any losers in their portfolios.Today, any investors looking to emulate Schieber’s strategy have one tool that was never available to her.StartEngine is an equity crowdfunding giant that lets ordinary investors claim stakes in some of the most potentially explosive, if risky, disruptors in the world. And it recently inked a deal with another crowdfunder — Indiegogo — that brings its network of 800,000 investors to StartEngine’s equity crowdfunding platform.The nature of this platform allows investors to claim small stakes in startups that present potentially enormous upsides. Increased risk is part of the strategy. But as was the case with Schieber, investors can use the platform to manage risk through diversification.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.53 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $9.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.1%. The $42.79 billion and $43.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.7% and +1.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Accelerating digital investments also bode well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP and Monster Beverage Corporation MNST are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks as well as dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Notably, some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, which complement their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers that include supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.What's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Evolving Trends: Companies in the soft drinks space have been gaining from improved demand trends, which are aiding volume growth. Market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, owing to recovery across markets, have been boosting sales. Implementing price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures has significantly lifted sales in recent quarters. The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Further, expansion into newer markets has been a key focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. Moreover, the companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shift in consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs and fintech platforms to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is plagued with higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher costs of sales and operating expenses, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Mohawk Industries:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$14b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Mohawk Industries has an ROCE of 12%.  In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Consumer Durables industry average of 17%, it's not as good. See our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured Mohawk Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Mohawk Industries here  for free.What Can We Tell From Mohawk Industries' ROCE Trend?Things have been pretty stable at Mohawk Industries, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at Mohawk Industries in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Mohawk Industries isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 64% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Like most companies, Mohawk Industries does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While Mohawk Industries may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

(NASDAQ:INTU)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-110107988.html,1670583667,STORY,['INTU'],"[Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has had a rough three months with its share price down 9.9%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuit's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Intuit How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuit is:12% = US$1.9b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.12.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Intuit's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Intuit's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 12%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 13% seen over the past five years by Intuit.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Intuit's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 24% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is INTU fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Intuit Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Intuit has a three-year median payout ratio of 32%, which implies that it retains the remaining 68% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, Intuit has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 21% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Intuit's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising.

Despite the volatility and slowing growth, long-term investors might consider buying stocks in December for 2023, even if that means starting tiny positions or dollar-cost averaging into blue chips. The two stocks we explore today are Intuit (INTU) and Mastercard (MA).Stocks climbed on Thursday to snap the S&amp;P 500's five-session losing streak. The benchmark will have to do more if it wants to climb back above its 200-daying moving average once again. Still, it was a positive sign to see buyers step up after the recent string of selling.Wall Street is finding it very difficult to gauge what’s next and seemingly overreacts in both directions following good and bad news when it comes to rate hikes. The Fed’s rapid and large rake hike efforts have certainly cooled overheated areas of the economy such as housing and technology, with more job cuts popping up in other areas.Consumer spending is also slowing, with even higher-income Americans turning a bit more frugal. A downturn is showing up in S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate revisions for 2023, though they are yet to signal the massive recession that some on Wall Street have warned about. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThere are plenty of other seemingly divergent signals about the health of consumers and the economy. And the Fed’s FOMC meeting and the November CPI report will likely prove pivotal in the near term. Thankfully, long-term investors can utilize periods of uncertainty and nerves as a chance to start positions in strong blue chip stocks.The first stock up today is Intuit Inc. INTU, which topped our first quarter FY23 estimates at the end of November. Intuit reiterated its 2023 operating income and earnings per share guidance, as its diversified offerings from tax help software to email marketing remain highly valuable to its customers.Story continuesIntuit’s growth outlook for FY23 and FY24 highlight strength and resilience. Even with its strong outlook and expanded portfolio, INTU shares have been crushed and recalibrated to reflect a new interest rate environment. Inuit now trades at potentially attractive long-term entry points, and Wall Street remains very high on INTU.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMastercard MA is a consumer and business credit card powerhouse that operates an elaborate backend processing network. Some might be worried that upstart fintech firms are set to eat Mastercard’s lunch, but MA’s growth outlook and its relative strength in 2022 point to the opposite.Mastercard topped Q3 estimates at the end of October and highlighted solid consumer spending in many segments, including travel. The company has also made sure it is making bets on future growth areas of the wider digital finance world. Mastercard, like Intuit, boasts an impressive outlook for both earnings and revenue expansion. And on December 6 it announced that it boosted its dividend and its share buyback program.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

338,823b68df-bbb3-34b4-b30e-efca5a623b7f,LYB,2022-12-09,Why Is DuPont de Nemours (DD) Up 4% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dupont-nemours-dd-4-163004322.html,1670517004,STORY,"['DD', 'LYB']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for DuPont de Nemours (DD). Shares have added about 4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DuPont de Nemours due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.DuPont's Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates in Q3DuPont logged earnings (on a reported basis) from continuing operations of 69 cents per share for third-quarter 2022, up from 48 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Barring one-time items, earnings came in at 82 cents per share for the reported quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. DuPont raked in net sales of $3,317 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.53%. The company saw an 11% rise in organic sales in the quarter, supported by 3% higher volumes and 8% pricing gains. It benefited from strong underlying demand in its major end-markets during the quarter, especially semiconductor, water and general industrial.Pricing actions and operational execution helped the company offset the cost inflation in the quarter. Volume rose on strong demand in semiconductor, water and industrial end-markets, partly masked by reduced volumes from protective garments within Safety Solutions and weakness in smartphones and personal computing within Interconnect Solutions.Segment HighlightsThe company’s Electronics &amp; Industrial segment recorded net sales of $1,511 million in the reported quarter, up 3% on a year-over-year comparison basis. Organic sales rose 7% on higher volumes and prices. Semiconductor Technologies organic sales rose on strong demand. Industrial Solutions also registered higher sales while organic sales declined in Interconnect Solutions on lower volumes.Net sales in the Water &amp; Protection unit were $1,534 million, up 10% year over year. Organic sales rose 15% on 13% pricing gains and 2% higher volumes.Story continuesFinancialsDuPont had cash and cash equivalents of $1,785 million at the end of the quarter, up around 7% year over year. Long-term debt was $10,564 million, down around 0.6% year over year.The company also generated operating cash flow of $419 million during the quarter. It returned $415 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.DuPont's board, on Nov 7, 2022, approved a new share buyback program authorizing the repurchase of up to $5 billion of common stock.OutlookThe company sees net sales for 2022 to be roughly $13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share for 2022 is now expected to be roughly $3.30.DuPont also envisions demand to remain strong in most end-markets, notably water, industrial and auto adhesives in the fourth quarter. However, it sees continued weakness in consumer electronics globally and some slowdown in customer semiconductor fab production rates. It also intends to cut production rates to realign working capital in expectation of a more normal supply chain environment. The company also sees incremental currency headwinds to further impact both top and bottom lines.DuPont also completed the Mobility &amp; Materials divestment to Celanese on Nov 1, 2022. Moreover, it terminated the earlier announced agreement to buy the outstanding shares of Rogers Corporation on Nov 1 due to lack of receipt of regulatory clearance.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, DuPont de Nemours has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookDuPont de Nemours has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerDuPont de Nemours is part of the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry. Over the past month, LyondellBasell (LYB), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.LyondellBasell reported revenues of $12.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.5%.

The company is seeing persistent weakness in the Power and Renewable Energy segments. Unfavorable foreign currency movements are adding to the woes of the company. Due to these headwinds, shares of GE have declined 10% so far this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSupply-chain disruptions are impacting deliveries in the commercial engine, thus hurting General Electric’s revenues. Delay in delivery of products due to supply-chain woes is impacting the company’s free cash flow. Shortage of raw materials and labor is weighing on the Aerospace segment, while the HealthCare segment is seeing reduced output due to supply-chain constraints. Lack of availability of raw materials is also hurting the Renewables segment. Supply-chain disruptions among other headwinds affected revenues by about 4 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022.Persistent weakness in the Power and Renewable Energy segment is concerning. Softness in aero-derivative unit shipments at Gas Power is hurting revenues at the Power segment. The segment’s revenues declined 8% year over year in the first nine months of 2022. Lower U.S. onshore wind volumes and continued pressure from onshore North American market dynamics are weighing on orders in the Renewable Energy segment. Revenues in the segment fell 17% in the first nine months of 2022. Adverse foreign currency movements are denting GE’s top line.

345,4cb18856-6614-3e41-9c08-554930824d63,GE,2022-12-09,Top 15 Automation Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-automation-companies-us-141634698.html,1670508994,STORY,"['TER', 'AMBA', 'OMCL', 'ROK', 'ZBRA', 'GE', 'ISRG', 'HON', 'NOVT', 'KITT']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 automation companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Automation Companies in the U.S. The onset of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing have provided companies with new technologies and avenues to improve their business processes. While the factory of the early days involved workers, now, companies rely on automated processes to make machines do their bidding. Automation is not limited only to manufacturing operations. Instead, it has also spread to power generation and even healthcare, with robots and timed delivery systems reducing the workload on doctors, surgeons, and nurses.Therefore, it's no surprise that the automation industry itself is worth billions of dollars. A research report from Acumen Research and Consulting outlines that the industry was worth $189.7 billion last year and from the end of this year to 2030, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7% to sit at $430.9 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm notes that a variety of different factors such as real time data for preventive analytics, robotic processes, intra company linkages through enterprise resource planning systems, and the growth in machine learning and big data analytics will drive the industry forward. Several different industries rely on automation these days, such as aerospace and defense, energy, pharmaceuticals, and automobile manufacturing. Asia Pacific is the largest automation market in the world, particularly since China's role as the world's manufacturing hub requires companies such as Foxconn to bring robots to their aid.Another report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the industrial automation market was worth $191.89 billion. It will grow to $205.86 billion by the end of this year, and from then until 2030, continue growing at a 9.8% CAGR for a final value of $395 billion. The firm adds that there is pent up growth in the industry due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic that stalled manufacturing, and at the same time, COVID also spurred the adoption of industrial automation due to the reduced need for social distance measures. Robots, after all, do not catch the coronavirus. However, Fortune Business Insights disagrees with Acumen Research when it comes to the largest industrial automation market. According to this research firm, Europe held the largest share of the pie in 2021, with an estimated market value of $61.85 billion. IoT and augmented reality will drive automation; however, a key hindrance will be large capital expenditures.Story continuesToday's piece will focus on the largest automation companies that either operate in or provide their services in the United States.

346,0e9b986a-a3e2-3ff2-bc04-5a769796cb06,UNH,2022-12-09,UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) Returns Have Hit A Wall,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-groups-nyse-unh-returns-120056625.html,1670587256,STORY,['UNH'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for UnitedHealth Group, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$27b ÷ (US$243b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 10% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for UnitedHealth Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for UnitedHealth Group.So How Is UnitedHealth Group's ROCE Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 72% in that time. 19% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UnitedHealth Group has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that UnitedHealth Group has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 42%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.What We Can Learn From UnitedHealth Group's ROCETo sum it up, UnitedHealth Group has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 166% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.If you're still interested in UnitedHealth Group it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: VICI Properties Inc. VICI, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Regency Centers Corp. REG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:3 REITs That Can Help Your Portfolio Weather a RecessionInflation concerns are refusing to abate and experts fear that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflationary pressure through rate hikes might push the economy toward a recession.A moderation in Consumer Price Index readings and an indication from the Fed about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December came as a relief. However, the recent employment report exhibited a strong labor market as well as higher-than-expected wage growth, suggesting that the inflation fight by the Fed might be tougher.Dividend-Paying Stocks Gain FocusAmid these uncertainties and increased volatility, the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Particularly, REITs like VICI Properties Inc., Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and Regency Centers Corp. look poised to not only deliver better results but also reward shareholders simultaneously.Why REITs?According to the third-quarter data from the Nareit Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker®) report, even amid a period of high inflation as well as rising rates, REITs’ operational performance exhibited strength with 14.9% and 8.1% year-over-year increases in funds from operations (FFO) and net operating income (NOI), respectively.Story continuesWith REITs continuing to experience earnings growth, this special hybrid asset class remains well-positioned to deliver a decent stream of dividend income to investors.Now if REITs’ historical dependence on debt makes investors skeptical in a rising rate environment, then it needs to be noted that over the years, REITs have managed their balance sheets efficiently and are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Per the third-quarter 2022 NAREIT report, leverage ratios remained near historic lows, with debt-to-market assets at 34.5%, while interest coverage increased to six times. Moreover, net interest expense as a percent of NOI was near its historical low at 18.9%. Also, REITs have extended the maturity of their debt with the weighted average term to maturity of REIT debt now being more than seven years, or 84 months. As such, REITs remain well-positioned for ongoing economic uncertainty.What’s more encouraging is REITs’ characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. In fact, the majority of leases are tied to inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even amid the inflationary period, investment in the REIT industry can offer a steady stream of income.Here’s How We Selected These REITsHowever, not all REITs are equally capable of keeping up their dividend-paying momentum. Therefore, to pick the right dividend stocks, we have employed the Zacks Stocks Screener and have shortlisted the REITs with a dividend yield of more than 2% (this criterion includes companies with a dividend yield above the S&amp;P 500′s average dividend yield of roughly 2%). Apart from this, we have considered REITs that have five-year historical dividend growth of greater than or equal to 0.001 (including companies that have increased their dividend over the past five years).Moreover, these stocks have a sturdy business model, which protects them from market volatility, and are known for providing a steady stream of income.

The company has made concerted efforts to grow its portfolio and team up with the best-in-class tenants. Such efforts are likely to aid VICI’s performance in the coming quarters.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

353,06f86ce9-cb17-30cf-bcd3-9c11e78781b5,MAC,2022-12-09,3 REITs With The Largest Recent Dividend Hikes,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-largest-recent-dividend-155154189.html,1670514714,STORY,"['MAC', 'KRG']","[If you’re a serious real estate investment trust (REIT) investor, dividend hikes are like music to your ears. If you already own the stocks that are announcing increases, you’ll receive more money each month or quarter and have the satisfaction of knowing that your annual yield, based on your purchase price, is also rising.But even if you don’t own the REIT that announces a dividend hike, there are two reasons that it may be compelling to invest in it. First, it shows the company feels its funds from operations (FFO) is strong enough to cover the increase. Second, dividend hikes often propel shares higher over the next quarter.Here’s a look at three REITs with some of the largest recent dividend hikes that may be worth your consideration:The Macerich Co. (NYSE: MAC) is a Santa Monica, California-based retail REIT that specializes in the acquisition, leasing and management of 48 million square feet in 44 regional town center malls across the U.S.The 52-week price range is $7.40 to $19.29. At the end of October, Macerich announced a quarterly dividend increase from $0.15 to $0.17, a 13.33% hike. Since then, Macerich shares are up about 17%.“Our decision to increase our dividend is reflective of our resilient business model and strong operating cash flow position,” Macerich CEO Tom O’Hern said of the dividend increase.The forward annual dividend of $0.68 currently yields 5.3%. Macerich cut its dividend drastically in early 2020 during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic but has paid a consistent quarterly dividend since then. The funds from operation (FFO) of $1.93 provide a very conservative payout ratio of only 35%, so there is plenty of room for additional dividend growth in the future.Kite Realty Group Trust (NYSE: KRG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT with open-air and mixed-use properties from Vermont to California. Its strip malls are mostly anchored by grocery stores. Other tenants include CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS), The Fresh Market, Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY), Burlington, Ross Stores Inc. and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST).Story continuesOn Nov. 9, Kite Realty Group Trust announced a hike in its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.24 per share, an increase of 9.09%. Kite Realty Group has increased its dividend eight times since July 2020 after COVID-19 forced a cut from $0.318 to $0.052 per share.Kite Realty Group has a forward FFO of $1.89. Its payout ratio of 50.7% is well within the range of safety, and it’s not difficult to imagine it eventually returning the dividend to the pre-COVID 19 levels. At a recent closing price of $22.07, it presently yields 4.3%. The 52-week range is $16.42 to $23.35.Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a Richmond, Virginia-based hotel REIT that owns and operates 220 hotels in 87 markets in 37 states. The portfolio includes 96 Marriotts, 119 Hiltons, four Hyatts and one independent hotel.Apple Hospitality REIT pays a monthly dividend, and in late October, the board of directors authorized an increase to its dividend from $0.07 to $0.08 per share. The new annual dividend of $0.96 per share yields about 5.7%.The 52-week range for the stock is $13.79 to $18.69. The stock was recently near $16.75 and has moved up about 21% since the dividend increase was announced.Apple Hospitality REIT’s second-quarter results were excellent, increasing its net income by 222% over the second quarter of 2021. FFO of $0.48 was more than ample to cover three months of dividend payments totaling $0.24, giving it a 50% payout ratio. Another dividend hike in 2023 is possible.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock is up an impressive 103% over the last five years. On the other hand, the stock price has retraced 3.8% in the last week. But note that the broader market is down 3.7% since last week, and this may have impacted Eaton's share price.Although Eaton has shed US$2.5b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. View our latest analysis for Eaton To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Eaton's earnings per share are down 2.0% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The revenue reduction of 2.1% per year is not a positive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthEaton is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Eaton, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Eaton shares lost 5.4% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 19%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith similar product catalogs, it raises a valid but potentially tricky question – which company’s shares currently appear more attractive?Let’s take a deeper dive to get a more evident answer.Share PerformanceBy looking at each company’s share performance, we can see which has seen more bullish action and which investors have preferred to buy.From a longer-term perspective (last five years), PEP shares have tacked on nearly 80% in value vs. KO’s nearly 65% gain. Still, both performances have outpaced the S&amp;P 500’s gain of roughly 63% in the same timeframe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpon shrinking the timeframe to encompass just the last six months of price action, we can see that PEP shares have again outperformed KO shares, up more than 13% vs. Coca-Cola’s 5% gain.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile PepsiCo shares have been stronger across several timeframes, both stocks have provided market-beating returns, undoubtedly a major positive.ValuationOf course, valuation must always be addressed. Currently, PEP shares trade at a 26.9X forward earnings multiple, whereas KO shares currently trade at a 25.6X forward earnings multiple.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBoth values reside above their respective five-year medians and the S&amp;P 500 average, indicating that investors will pay a premium for shares of both companies. Still, KO shares are slightly cheaper than PEP shares.DividendsDividends provide a solid boost to any portfolio, limiting the impact of drawdowns and providing a passive income stream.Impressively, KO and PEP are both Dividend Kings, showing an unparalleled commitment to their shareholders through 50+ consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.Story continuesCurrently, PepsiCo’s annual dividend yields 2.5% vs. KO’s 2.8%, a modest difference.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, there’s a notable difference regarding each company’s dividend growth; PEP’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate handily outpaces KO’s 3.1%. Growth OutlookUndoubtedly important is the growth trajectory of each company. After all, if a company isn’t growing, why would an investor want to buy?Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for PepsiCo's current fiscal year (FY22) indicates Y/Y growth of roughly 8%. And in FY23, earnings are forecasted to tack on a further 7.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding Coca-Cola, earnings are forecasted to climb 6.5% in its current fiscal year (FY22) but decline a marginal 0.4% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo undoubtedly wins this round, with forecasted earnings growth for both its current and next fiscal year.Bottom LineThe Coca-Cola Company KO and PepsiCo PEP are undoubtedly titans in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, with market caps north of $200 billion.Still, with similar operations, investors may be left wondering which company’s shares would provide a better bang for their buck.In this heavyweight battle, PepsiCo appears to come out on top.

Accelerating digital investments also bode well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP and Monster Beverage Corporation MNST are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks as well as dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Notably, some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, which complement their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers that include supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.What's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Evolving Trends: Companies in the soft drinks space have been gaining from improved demand trends, which are aiding volume growth. Market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, owing to recovery across markets, have been boosting sales. Implementing price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures has significantly lifted sales in recent quarters. The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Further, expansion into newer markets has been a key focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. Moreover, the companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shift in consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs and fintech platforms to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is plagued with higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher costs of sales and operating expenses, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #61, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is reiterating a positive outlook for the global airline industry and forecasts that airlines combined will record a net profit of $4.7 billion next year. That would be the industry’s first positive season since the pandemic started in 2020. IATA observed in June that industry wide profitability “appears within reach” in 2023. As per data by IATA, passenger levels will return to pre-pandemic numbers in 2024, which is approximately 5.2 billion passengers. Airline industry losses in 2022 reached $6.9 billion, shrinking from the $9.7 billion loss forecast in June. IATA chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said that the industry’s financial results were “nothing but phenomenal.”Shipping rates that ran rampant during challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have now plunged, which some market experts are calling a “freight recession”, as inventory surplus across the US met weaker demand. This scenario has put the shipping freight sector at a disadvantage during annual contract negotiations, but this is positive for retailers and other customers who will benefit from reasonable transportation costs. Some of the best transportation stocks to buy heading into 2023 include Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP). Our Methodology We selected the following transportation stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. 10 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2023FiledIMAGE/Shutterstock.comBest Transportation Stocks To Buy Heading Into 202310. Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) was incorporated in 2006 and is based in Marousi, Greece. It is a shipping company that specializes in the ocean transportation of dry bulk cargoes worldwide. The company's vessels transport iron ores, coal, grains, bauxite, fertilizers, and steel products. Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) is set to pay a $1.20 per share quarterly dividend on December 12, to shareholders of the company as of November 30. The dividend yield on December 8 came in at 26.03%. Story continuesOn October 27, Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra maintained a Buy recommendation on Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $33 from $40 ahead of the company's Q3 results.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) was part of 16 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 18 in the prior quarter. Howard Marks’ Oaktree Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 26 million shares worth $454.8 million. In addition to Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP), Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) is one of the best transportation stocks to consider buying for 2023. Here is what Massif Capital has to say about Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We initiated one long position, one short position and exited one position during the third quarter. Our new long position was in Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK), a pure-play dry bulk operator with roughly 120 controlled vessels and 14 million tons of combined cargo capacity globally.SBLK has one of the better management teams in the maritime shipping industry and the lowest cost structure among all dry bulk names. After announcing their new dividend policy in May, SBLK now has one of the best payout structures in shipping. The firm has paid out $0.3 and $0.7 per share in dividends for the first and second quarters of 2021. SBLK will most likely announce a dividend for the third quarter somewhere in the $1.15-$1.25 per share range, depending on movement in net working capital.We believe the best way to look at this business is through cash generation potential and how much is returned to investors. The current equity valuation does not reflect current rates for shipping (earnings), partly because of the velocity of the move in rates and because shipping cycles turn, and it’s not clear whether this is a local top or the early innings of a multi-year cycle. Our belief is the latter. Part of our catalyst is the market re-rating the stock higher once the length of the increased earnings power becomes understood. It is a relatively strong catalyst in the sense that with a strong dividend policy, we can be patient for the market to underwrite this story as the cash is either returned to us via a high dividend yield if the market is either slow or chooses not to join our side of the trade.Our estimates suggest a time-charter equivalent rate (net profit or loss of operating a vessel daily) of at least $30,000 for SBLK in Q4, with the firm earning a potential annual average of $26,000. Our base case is that this is a strong floor going into next year, with little need to articulate much more upside. If rates hold, which we expect them to do, we could see a 20+% annual dividend next year for SBLK. If the market priced the equity such that the dividend yield was 8%, that implies a $62 stock. Today our base case target for the firm is $37 per share. This is likely conservative as we know that third-quarter rates are higher than the second quarter, and third-quarter dividends will most likely reflect that. We are cautious about diving too deep into the sensitivities to the upside with this position as we are arriving at some pretty remunerative torque using current contracted values and seemingly conservative forecasts…” (Click here to see the full text)9.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.38bUS$6.67bUS$7.14bUS$7.18bUS$7.26bUS$7.35bUS$7.46bUS$7.59bUS$7.72bUS$7.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 1.03%Est @ 1.31%Est @ 1.51%Est @ 1.65%Est @ 1.75%Est @ 1.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$5.9kUS$5.7kUS$5.7kUS$5.3kUS$5.0kUS$4.7kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$135bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$135b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$63bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$112b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$212, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.063. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

Retailers placing past-season merchandise is ""not a good sign"" for profit margins or customer engagement at a time of slowing demand for clothing, she said.""Shoppers are buying to wear right now,"" Ramirez added, so having items that customers immediately want and need is crucial.Gap declined to comment.Shopper demand has put a strain on apparel retailers throughout the year, boosting inventories and forcing retailers including Gap, Victoria's Secret and Kohl's, to slash prices.Story continuesAfter receiving holiday items too late for 2021, the retailers also began ordering seasonal items earlier in 2022 to avoid supply-chain mishaps, but found themselves struggling with lower demand from customers strained by rising costs of gas and groceries.Express reported an 8% fall in quarterly comparable sales on Thursday, blaming a drop in demand from lower income shoppers and fashion misses in its women's apparel business.""We are already working to realign our assortments based on customer purchasing behavior, re-calibrate our opening price points, and address opportunities in our women's business,"" Express Chief Executive Officer Tim Baxter said on an analyst call.The company, which was offering holiday discounts of 30%-50% online and in-store earlier this week, said inventories were up 10% in the third quarter and would improve towards the end of the year.Total inventories were up 30% in the second quarter and 40% in the first, after it brought in late holiday merchandise. Sequined blazers and pants from last holiday season are now on store floors, Express told investors in November.Deals since October and over Thanksgiving weekend were up in both frequency and discounting depth, including from clothing retailers, according to research from Jane Hali &amp; Associates. Some started promoting at higher levels earlier than last year.General apparel was the most discounted category between Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, according to Salesforce data on Tuesday, with discounts averaging about 34%.'MARGIN DRAIN'Gap also warned investors in November that carrying summer merchandise into the fall was a ""margin drain,"" and now some of those styles are still on Gap's racks, according to store checks.Gap.com on Tuesday posted discounts of 60% on basic crewneck t-shirts. The promotion excluded trendier styles like faux leather pants.In mid-November, Gap Chief Financial Officer Katrina O'Connell said it expects to enter 2023 with lowered inventories, even if it must slash prices. She said that holding on to unsold inventory would ""use up cash"" in the short term and that the company is focused on clearing old merchandise by the new year.To be sure, getting rid of old clothing by 2023 could help Gap and Express free up space for trendy merchandise that shoppers are willing to buy and will cut costs on warehousing.Gap's clothing stock for the third quarter ended Oct. 29 was 12% higher, with 9 percentage points being what Gap executives call ""pack and hold"" merchandise — stored away ""slow-turning"" basics, including tee-shirts and shorts, that would eventually return to sales floors.Gap's profit margin's fell to 38.7% in its third quarter from 41.9% a year earlier, significantly impacted by markdowns. Wall Street expects Gap's margins to rise to 34.61% in the holiday quarter from 33.66% last year.Express reported third-quarter gross margins of 27.8% on Thursday, down from 33.2% a year earlier.

I am inspired by my culture, the Native/Indigenous community, and the perseverance of my family, and I'm grateful for those who paved the way for me to have the opportunities I've had in my career. I am Pomo, Hawaiian, and Choctaw, and my family and community have been impacted by systemic policies meant to eradicate our very existence; that is the reality of my people.I am a huge advocate for my native community here in Oakland, California. I serve as a board member for the Intertribal Friendship House, where I spend most of my time outside of work volunteering, delivering food to elders and needy families, serving food at drum and dance, the elders luncheons, working the booth at the Red Market, organizing turkey donations, Christmas donations and so much more. To me Intertribal Friendship House is more than an organization. It is the heart of a vibrant Tribal community. My grandmother who I was named after was one of the co-founders back in the 1940's and I am continuing her legacy. Cisco employees can find information on how to donate here.I'm proud to work at Cisco and to break through many of the challenges that BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) women face in the tech industry. My journey in tech started many years ago as an Executive Assistant for a Fortune 500 financial institution. In that role, I started to support the Information Security Office and learned that I enjoy solution-focused work. This led me to work for several large tech companies, traveling to various countries across the globe.I joined Cisco in 2018 supporting compliance certifications, and eventually became an Audit Lead for Cisco's largest customers. During this time I was also nominated for the Excellent Performance Award by a Senior Director. I transitioned to Cisco Meraki to help with standardized security and assurance certifications. Currently, I'm working in Customer &amp; Partner Experience as a Compliance Engineering Architect. While here I was recognized by my leadership to participate in Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) Career Advancement Program, an initiative that prepares highly talented, mid-career professionals for senior leadership roles.Story continuesCisco's Native American Network (NAN)I'm very passionate about co-leading the Native American Network (NAN), one of Cisco's Inclusive Communities, as we elevate Native/Indigenous voices. I quickly learned about Cisco's commitment to full-spectrum diversity and inclusion through employee communities that enable engagement, positive impact, and giving back. This is the first company I have worked for to offer such amazing support and learning opportunities for employees.NAN is a Native American inclusive community dedicated to growing and empowering Native/Indigenous perspectives at Cisco and beyond. We raise awareness within Cisco (Native and non-Native) on tribal issues, social justice, events, and providing forums to learn about Native cultures. And we achieve this through our five pillars - Community, Connect, Professional Development, Social Justice, and Talent Acquisition. We are open membership and welcome all allies and supporters, Native or Non-Native, and Cisco employees are welcome to join our network through our internal site.We have hosted many events such as our discussion on ""Columbus vs Indigenous Peoples Day"" and a cultural appreciation series that highlights Indigenous cooking, beading, and language preservation. We raise awareness of Missing &amp; Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW), and we organize a book club that features Native authors. We also shared an insightful talk with filmmaker Willow O'Feral, documentarian Brad Heck, and artist Gregg Deal.Here are some ideas on how to get involved during Native American Heritage Month (and all year!):Learn about the Native tribes in your areaCheck out Native American museums and cultural centersTake a deeper dive with Native American heritage sitesRead books by or about Native Americans, Alaska Natives, or Native HawaiiansConnect with the landLearn about traditional Native American, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian music and instrumentsSample authentic Native American foodAttend a powwowI'm very honored to work for a company that fosters an environment where historically underrepresented women can be successful, and I'm proud of the commitment Cisco has made to Native/Indigenous communities, to listen, learn and elevate our voices. In partnership with some of our biggest customers, Cisco is dedicated to ensuring state-of-the-art broadband networks are deployed by as many recognized Native American Tribes as possible.Here, I'm encouraged to be a strong, confident, Native Woman.
