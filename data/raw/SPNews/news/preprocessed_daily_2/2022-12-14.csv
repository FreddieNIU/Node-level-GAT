Leveraging TI's half-bridge GaN FET with integrated gate driver, LMG2610, Chicony Power and TI collaborated on a design to reduce the size of Chicony's power adapter by 50% and increase efficiency up to 94%.As a leading power supply provider committed to improving power conversion efficiency in electronic power designs, Chicony Power has worked closely with international IC companies, providing them with market and technical requirements to help develop solutions in new designs. For the Le Petit laptop adapter design, Chicony Power teamed up with TI for its expertise in high-voltage design and its integrated GaN technology. TI's LMG2610 is designed to be paired with the UCC28782 active clamp flyback (ACF) controller to create an easy-to-use, high-efficiency, and high-power-density solution for AC/DC designs under 75 W.Improving power conversion efficiency Increasingly, consumers seek smaller, lighter electronics while also wanting to reduce their energy footprint. In the laptop power adapter market, this has challenged engineers to find new ways to pack more power in smaller spaces while minimizing power loss to deliver more efficient adapters.Chicony Power and TI were able to miniaturize the power adapter design and lower the use of mechanical materials by 40% by leveraging TI's LMG2610 GaN FET, which integrates upper and lower switches, gate driver IC, level shifter and bootstrap circuits on a single chip, as well as Chicony Power's 3D structure, component miniaturization, heat dissipation system and electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression design expertise. Le Petit has a compact size of 49 cm3, slightly larger than a typical ice cube, with a power supply conversion efficiency as high as 94% compared to the 89% efficiency achieved by typical power adapters using silicon materials.Story continues""Our collaboration with Chicony Power is an example of how TI's products help make electronics smaller, more energy-efficient and more reliable,"" said Luke Lee, TI's vice president for Asia and president for Taiwan, Korea and South Asia. ""Our highly integrated GaN technology enables power adapters with improved thermal performance and power efficiency while delivering high power density with fewer components.""""Chicony has been committed to corporate social responsibility and has been implementing the code of conduct of Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) for many years,"" said Winson Huang, chief procurement officer, Chicony Power. ""The collaboration with TI to develop a new generation of power adapters will not only provide consumers with lighter and more convenient devices, compared to other 65-W adapters in the market, but also use the advantages of both parties to jointly create more energy-efficient products.""Addressing thermal and EMI challenges In addition to power efficiency and size advantages delivered by TI's integrated GaN technology, the UCC28780 and UCC28782 flyback controllers support high-frequency zero-voltage switching (ZVS) design. Combining these advantages with Chicony Power's power design expertise, Chicony Power's designers were able to overcome the temperature increases and rise in EMI typically caused by higher frequency energy in lightweight power supplies, and effectively reduced the size of the power adapter while maintaining temperature and performance control.To learn more about Chicony Power, see https://www.chiconypower.com.For more information on TI's GaN technology, see ti.com/gantechnology.About Texas InstrumentsTexas Instruments Incorporated (Nasdaq: TXN) is a global semiconductor company that designs, manufactures, tests and sells analog and embedded processing chips for markets such as industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems.

The investment will strengthen Nucor's position as a sustainability leader and expand on the innovation that has already resulted in cleaner steel manufacturing in the United States.Electra transforms low-grade iron ores into high-purity iron with renewable energy. Utilizing zero-carbon intermittent electricity, the company converts commercial and low-grade ores into Low-Temperature Iron. The iron produced can be turned into steel by electric arc furnaces, which are already in use and are responsible for 70% of American steel production.The process developed by Electra produces zero-carbon-dioxide emissions. The startup uses renewable electricity to electrochemically convert iron ore into pure iron at 140 degrees Fahrenheit.Based in Charlotte, NC, NUE is one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world that uses primarily recycled scrap as raw material. It also produces direct reduced iron (DRI) that is further used in its steel mills. With the first electric arc furnace, Nucor revolutionized the steel industry. It believes that it can develop and scale up zero-carbon iron products.Over the years, Nucor has expanded through acquisitions and entering markets. It has been looking for new and innovative ways to assist its customers in meeting their sustainability goals. Nucor will keep working on its strategy to invest capital in companies that will benefit the company and the entire industry.In the third quarter of 2022, Nucor’s raw material and steel product units’ earnings increased from the prior-year figures. The raw material unit gained from higher profits from the company's direct reduced iron facilities, offset by lower profits from scrap brokerage and processing operations. However, its steel mills unit faced a decline due to metal margin contraction and lower shipping volumes.Nucor reported net earnings of $6.50 per share in the third quarter. This marked a decline from the prior-year quarter’s net earnings of $7.28 per share.

5,50d7821f-536b-3e8d-a380-a66820556a8f,UNM,2022-12-14,5 Valuable Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in December,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-valuable-price-book-stocks-112411457.html,1671017051,STORY,"['SIG', 'UNM', 'AER', 'CLS']","[There are several different ways to find value stocks. Among these, the most popular are the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which though used less often, is an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Celestica CLS, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Aercap AER and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.Story continuesBut there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F (1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world, serving the computer and communications sectors.Celestica has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A.

They are designed to provide investors with a high degree of exposure to a particular asset class or market segment. Unlike traditional ETFs, leveraged ETFs are designed to magnify the return of the underlying index. They do this by using derivatives such as options and futures contracts, as well as borrowing money to increase the size of their portfolio. This can lead to amplified gains, but also amplified losses.It's a Two Way StreetLet's take an example to understand the behavior of a leveraged ETF. A 3x leveraged ETF seeks to deliver three times the daily performance of the underlying index. So, if the underlying index rises 1%, the ETF will rise 3%. Conversely, if the underlying index falls 1%, the ETF would decline 3%. Leveraged ETFs are a popular tool for traders and investors who want to take advantage of short-term price movements. Leveraged ETFs can also be used to hedge against market volatility or to diversify a portfolio. However, investing in leveraged ETFs carries a high degree of risk by nature, and investors should evaluate their risk tolerance before exploring this instrument.By design, leveraged ETFs are more suitable for day traders or investors with a short-term time horizon. For investors that do not have the risk tolerance for trading leveraged ETFs, they can opt for individual stocks that are among these funds' holdings. Some of the most popular long-term stocks among elite money managers and also present in leveraged ETFs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).Photo by Behnam Norouzi on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyTo determine the best performing leveraged ETFs in 2022, we screened for leveraged ETFs with varying ratios including 1.25, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x.

We think this pricing power should protect profitability during the acute inflationary phase and potentially lead to margin expansion when cost pressures abate. Linde also continues to be well-positioned on hydrogen and carbon capture with contract-backed project capex likely accelerating in the medium term as the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rolls out.”In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is also a stock that is popular among elite money managers.9.

To skip our detailed analysis of the nanotechnology sector in 2022 and the future of nanotech, go directly and see 5 Best Nanotechnology Stocks to Buy Now.Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a close-to atomic scale to develop new structures, materials, and devices. Developed in the late 1980s, nanotechnology has since transformed numerous industries like medicine, consumer products, energy, materials and manufacturing. The concept is best explained by Chad Mirkin, a Northwestern University's professor of chemistry and materials science:“Everything, when miniaturized to the sub-100-nanometer scale, has new properties, regardless of what it is. This is what makes nanoparticles the materials of the future. They have strange chemical and physical properties compared to their larger-particle kin. The thing that matters about nanoparticles is their scale. The smaller you go, the ratio of surface to bulk atoms goes up. At a larger scale, the atoms at the surface are relatively inconsequential. But at nanoscales, you could have a particle that is almost all surface. Those atoms begin to contribute very significantly to the overall properties of the material.”Photo by L N on UnsplashGlobal Nanotechnology Industry: An OutlookAmid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for nanotechnology was estimated to be around $54.2 billion in 2020. Since then, the figure has been revised to project an overall expected market worth of $126.8 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% over the analysis period 2020-2027. The market is highly diversified into multiple segments, one of them being Nano Materials. The Nano Materials segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13% to reach $107.4 billion by the end of the aforementioned analysis period. The segment currently accounts for a little more than 15% of the global nanotechnology market.According to recent reports, the countries dominating the global nanotechnology sector in 2022 are China, the United States, India, Iran, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. The United States accounts for more than 29.5% of the global market size while China accounts for 29.53%, making the latter the largest nanotechnology contributor in the world. China is expected to reach an estimated market size of $22.1 billion at the end of the analysis period. Among noteworthy geographic markets which are rapidly becoming players on the global stage are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at more than 11%, respectively, over the 2020-2027. Some of the largest players in the market today are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO).Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we looked at Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 920 elite hedge funds and identified some of the most popular stocks which use nanotechnology or produce products related to nanotechnology. Then, we picked 10 stocks with strong fundamentals, positive analyst ratings, or a favorable hedge fund sentiment.The stocks have been ranked based on the number of hedge funds which hold stakes in them, from lowest to highest.Best Nanotechnology Stocks to Buy Now10. VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO)Hedge Fund Holdings: 15Based in Plainview, New York, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) is a global capital equipment supplier which specializes in the design and manufacture of processing systems for different technologies. In 2017, the company acquired Cambridge Nanotech, an innovator in atomic layer deposition. In Q3 2022, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) posted an EPS of $0.45, beating estimates of $0.41 by $0.04. The company beat consensus expectations of $170.9 million, posting a Q3 2022 revenue of $171.9 million. Like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) is one of the best nanotechnology stocks to buy now.On November 15, Benchmark analyst Mark Miller lowered the price target on VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) to $25 from $35, keeping a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, while there was significant upside in the company's Q3 2022 earnings when compared to Q2 2022, the tenuous macroeconomic climate is likely to catch up with the stock. However, the company sees strong demand in areas like advanced packaging and MOCVD, which the stock is well-leveraged to capitalize upon. In light of this, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) remains significantly undervalued on the assumption of long-term revenue growth of more than 9%.9. PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG)Hedge Fund Holdings: 34Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is an American company and global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

(NYSE:PPG) to $128 from $130, keeping a Buy rating on the shares.

It has an impressive track record of delivering shareholder returns via share buybacks and dividend growth, recently declaring a $0.62 dividend in October. Due to this, the analyst reckons the stock is drastically mispriced with respect to its strong fundamentals and favorable potential.Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG) in their Q1 2022 investor letter:“While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8. IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM)Hedge Fund Holdings: 40Based in Armonk, New York, IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology corporation which specializes in the production and sale of hardware, middleware and software.

The company's blockchain segment is well-leveraged to carry the company through macroeconomic headwinds, and a volatile foreign exchange situation. And although IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Q3 2022 returns were not exceptional, growth catalysts like IFS and hybrid cloud will aid the company in restoring a positive growth trend.7. DuPont de Nemours Inc.

(NYSE:DD) to $81 from $76, keeping a Buy rating on the shares.

Furthermore, Selesky ascertains that the company's portfolio transformation is nearly complete and if the company can show stable demand and/or margins, its multiple can expand.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Timothy Welsh, sold US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$44.25). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 26% of Timothy Welsh's stake.U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of U.S. Bancorp shares. In total, insiders dumped US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. U.S. Bancorp insiders own about US$110m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At U.S. Bancorp Tell Us?Insiders sold U.S. Bancorp shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with U.S. Bancorp and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course U.S. Bancorp may not be the best stock to buy.

I was in high school and had to take the same classes as everyone else,"" Asenjo Perez recalled. ""I had to work extra hard and try to learn English on my own as much as I could to be able to graduate. I was working part-time, too, and didn't really have any one in my family who had the knowledge to help me. It just took my own efforts and the kindness of a friend.""Asenjo Perez's family lived in Arizona when they first arrived, and several years later she relocated to Kentucky. There, she joined U.S. Bank earlier this year at the Hopkinsville branch, which is in the southwest part of the state and boasts a population of approximately 31,000. She said coming to America was always a dream and becoming a U.S. citizen was the end goal.

We were all excited to hear she was applying for her citizenship and anxious to hear the results when she took her test. We were thrilled to have her as our newest member but now we super proud to call her compatriot.""After her swearing-in ceremony, Asenjo Perez felt excited and said a few of the things she looks forward to doing as a U.S. citizen is voting and even paying taxes. Today, the citizenship dream is still alive for both of her parents who are waiting for the 15-year mark to take the test in Spanish.Story continuesDaily, she finds purpose serving people in the Hopkinsville community and especially making a difference to the Spanish-speaking U.S. Bank customers so she can serve them better.""I got married last year, have a five-year-old at home and one on the way, so becoming a citizen recently is a wonderful addition to this exciting chapter of life. Since joining U.S. Bank, I have witnessed several occasions where it's obvious the company cares about its employees.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2022. This year’s inflation and continued interest rates hike were heavy on the markets. Analysts recommended investing in income-generating stocks because they could stabilize overall portfolios through dividends. Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”9.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.32bUS$1.54bUS$1.67bUS$1.87bUS$2.02bUS$2.15bUS$2.25bUS$2.34bUS$2.42bUS$2.49bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.92%Est @ 6.14%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.02%Est @ 3.41%Est @ 2.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$50bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$50b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$39b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$75.3, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Edwards Lifesciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.904. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

(NYSE:WMT) insiders sold US$17m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-insiders-130035955.html,1671022835,STORY,['WMT'],"[In the last year, many Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Walmart The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At WalmartIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Advisor, M. Biggs, sold US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$140 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$147. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 8.2% of M. Biggs's holding.Insiders in Walmart didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Walmart Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Walmart. In total, insiders sold US$7.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of WalmartAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$3.6b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Walmart Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Walmart stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Walmart is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Walmart. For example - Walmart has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

And these days, you don’t have to buy a house to get a piece of the action.Check out real estate investment trusts, which are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate.REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. That means investors don’t have to worry about screening tenants, fixing damages or chasing down late payments. Instead, they simply sit back and enjoy the dividend checks rolling in when they pick a winning REIT.Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic did impact some commercial real estate. And not all REITs are the same. If you are a landlord for e-commerce giant Amazon, for instance, you should have no problem collecting a steady stream of rental income.With that in mind, let’s take a look at two REITs paying oversized dividends to investors — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash.Don’t missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classChances are good you're overpaying for home insurance. Here's how to spend less on peace of mindAmazon’s landlordThe first one is STAG Industrial (STAG), a REIT that owns and operates single-tenant industrial properties throughout the U.S. Its biggest tenant is Amazon.The company’s portfolio consists of 563 buildings totaling approximately 112 million rentable square feet across 41 states.Note that about 460 of those properties are warehouses, which happen to be an essential part of e-commerce.Moreover, a tenant survey in 2021 revealed that around 40% of the REIT’s portfolio handles e-commerce activity.To see how solid STAG Industrial is, take a look at its dividend history.Since the company went public in 2011, it has paid higher regular dividends every single year.Story continuesWhile most dividend-paying companies follow a quarterly distribution schedule, STAG Industrial pays shareholders every month. The monthly dividend rate stands at 12.7 cents per share, which translates to an annual yield of 4.2%.STAG Industrial shares are down 18% over the past 12 months.Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets insteadWalmart’s landlordWhen it comes to paying monthly dividends, one company stands out above all — Realty Income (O).Realty Income has been paying uninterrupted monthly dividends since its founding in 1969. That’s 630 consecutive monthly dividends paid.Better yet, since the company went public in 1994, it has announced 118 dividend increases.Realty Income has a diverse portfolio of over 11,700 commercial properties located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the UK and Spain. It leases them to around 1,100 different tenants operating across 79 industries.This means even if one tenant or industry enters a downturn, the impact on company-level financials will likely be limited.For instance, while Realty Income rents some properties to AMC Theaters — whose business was hurt by COVID-19 — it also has Walgreens, FedEx and Walmart as some of its top tenants. And these businesses turned out to be largely pandemic-proof.Earlier this month, the REIT announced a monthly cash dividend to 24.85 cents per share, giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 4.4%.Realty Income shares are down just 2% over the past year.What to read next'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysWant to invest your spare change but don't know where to start?

In order to do so, many consumers are veering away from traditional supermarkets and heading to big-box giants like Walmart, which is famed for its mega discounts across various retail categories.Related: 9 Costco Brand Items That Aren’t Worth the MoneyAlso: 3 Easy Tips To Turn Your Credit Woes Into WowsPerhaps surprisingly, though, Walmart doesn’t always offer the best deals on food items (take meat and maple syrup, for example). So, what groceries should you buy from Walmart when money is tight? Let’s have a look.Peanut Butter“If you like peanut butter, you can buy a huge 64 oz jar of the Great Value brand for around $4.94, which is roughly 7.7 cents per ounce,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. “You can obviously eat things like peanut butter sandwiches, but you can also add it to other things for a flavor boost.”Bread“Speaking of peanut butter sandwiches, pick up some Great Value bread on your trip and you’ll be set for a good bit,” Ramhold said. “A loaf of white bread is about 93 cents, so you could stock up and freeze what you don’t need right away. Or if you prefer honey wheat, Great Value makes that but it’ll set you back about $1.58, so it’s slightly more expensive than the standard white bread.”Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?Milk“A gallon of Great Value milk is about $3.14, whether you prefer whole milk or 2%,” Ramhold said. “It’s not the cheapest item to buy if you’re broke, but it’s a healthy thing to have on hand, and the price isn’t too bad as long as you stick with the store-brand. Plus, if you want cereal for easy meals, it’s a must-have unless you prefer your cereal dry; in that case, milk is still good to have on hand to make things like oatmeal a little creamier or boxed mac and cheese tastier.”Oatmeal“Oatmeal gets a bad reputation for being bland, but if you know how to cook it, it’s pretty much a blank canvas,” Ramhold said. “Stick with the store brand again and opt for the containers of either old fashioned oats or quick cooking oats — don’t bother with the packs of instant oatmeal. The instant stuff is tasty but it’s loaded with sugar — if you cook your own from the ‘plain’ stuff, you can control what goes into it, so you can still make it sweet if you prefer, but without going overboard. Plus the value of the canisters is much better than the boxes of individual packets. For example, Great Value oats (either old fashioned or quick cooking) is about $3.98 for a 42 oz container or 9 cents per oz; a box of Great Value packets (20 packages of 1.05 oz each) is about $3.28, or 13 cents per oz.”Story continuesDried Pasta“You can’t go wrong with dried pasta, and Great Value offers plenty of different kinds to choose from, whether it’s rotini, penne, spaghetti, elbows, bowtie, fettuccini, egg noodles and more,” Ramhold said. “Most boxes of pasta are about 92 cents each, though you’ll obviously pay more for larger quantities — for example, a 2lb box of elbow pasta is around $1.67 while a bag of egg noodles is around $1.43.”Pasta Sauces“Whether you want to just heat them up and pour them over pasta or use them as ingredients in other dishes, the prices are pretty great at Walmart, especially if you stick with the Great Value brand,” Ramhold said. “Standard tomato-based sauces are around $1.48 for 24 oz jars, while a 22 oz jar of alfredo sauce will go for slightly more — about $2.28.”Canned TunaA tuna sandwich (or, if you have more time, a tuna casserole) is an easy way to get a big dose of protein. You can get a four-can batch of Great Value Chunk Light Tuna in Water, 5 ounces at Walmart for $3.14 — cheaper than what similar products go for at Dollar General.Top RamenTop Ramen and the word “broke” go so well together that Top Ramen should probably weave it into its marketing copy. Dollar stores are great places to stock up on Top Ramen, but if you are already at Walmart, you could do worse than buying the Nissin Top Ramen, Chicken Flavor, New, 3 ounces, 48 count for $28.70 — which could work out to under 60 cents a meal.Seasoning Packets“From brown gravy to taco seasoning to ranch dressing mix and more, these packets are great for keeping on hand to mix things up,” Ramhold said. “If you opt for the Great Value brand, you can expect to pay anywhere from 40 cents to 50 cents per packet or so, which means you can add a lot of flavor to a basic meal for very little price-wise.”Canned Veggies“These are non-perishable, so you can easily stock up and hang on to them until you need them, and things like green beans, corn, or sweet peas are about 58 cents each for 14.5 oz cans,” Ramhold said. “If you’re having a hard time getting your hands on fresh produce, this is a good compromise, as you’re still getting veggies, and they can be doctored up with salt and pepper to taste decent enough.”More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Groceries To Buy From Walmart When You’re Broke]"

You can also check out our recently published article - 12 Safest Stocks to Invest In - on a related topic.Geopolitical tensions, concerns about inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve continue to make equity markets volatile. As a result, investors are bound to focus on low-beta stocks as such stocks act as a shield to current market scenario. Therefore, including some of the low-beta stocks comes as a necessity as such stocks deliver healthy returns in the long run. Inclusion of some low-beta stocks in the portfolio can make it somewhat defensive.Stocks having a beta value of 1 means that their price activity is strongly correlated with general market. If beta value is less than 1, they tend to be less volatile in comparison to general market. On the contrary, beta value of more than 1 signifies that the stock is more volatile than general market.As a matter of fact, low-volatility/low-beta stocks have the characteristics of a bond. Such stocks are typically large, and are profitable and dividend-paying firms. Such companies have mediocre growth opportunities. Simply put, low-beta stocks have characteristics of safety rather than components of risk and opportunity. As a result, such stocks exhibit higher correlations with long-term bond returns.Empirical research exhibits that low-volatility securities generate higher risk-adjusted returns in the long run. That is true because such securities usually fall less in down markets. Study by Bradford Jordan and Timothy Riley in 2016 stated that high-volatility/high-beta stocks and stocks having high short interest deliver poor risk-adjusted future performance. Low-beta premium largely depends on whether low volatility is in value or growth regime, whether past returns were high or low, and general performance of size premium. Studies have shown that when low-volatility stocks continue to have value exposure, they on average, outperformed general market by approximately 2%. When low-volatility stocks have growth exposure, they tend to underperform by approximately 1.4%, on average.Story continuesTherefore, returns to low beta anomaly are justified when low-beta stocks are in value regime, and when high-beta stocks having low short interest are excluded.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best low beta stocks to buy.11 Best Low Beta Stocks to BuyInvestments, FinanceOur MethodologyIn order to identify the best low beta stocks to buy, we first need to identify the list of low beta stocks. For that purpose we used the holdings of ETC 6 Meridian Low Beta Equity Strategy ETF (SIXL). According to its website SIXL uses the following methodology to come up with its 200+ low beta stocks: ""Stocks are first screened to remove those that score poorly on financial and growth measures. Those stocks that remain are then ranked according to their beta."" After identifying 240 low beta stocks we ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment index. So our list of the 11 best low beta stocks to buy is based on more than 900 equity hedge funds' consensus views.11 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy11. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) discovers, develops, and markets drugs for a range of therapeutic areas including cardiovascular, cancer, and immune disorders.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”10.

In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8.

Here are the details:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles: 15 Biggest European Tech CompaniesTop 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World15 Best Electric Car Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 11 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Citigroup entered the agreement in October 2022, when it also said that it would transfer a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card balances to Uralsib, subject to customer consent.None of the firms has disclosed the financial details of the transaction.Uralsib stated, “The acquired portfolio includes unsecured consumer loans, which going forward will be serviced by Uralsib Bank from the moment of purchase.”Uralsib said that the loan portfolio has high credit quality, which allows it to increase its client base in Moscow and St Petersburg.The divestiture underlines Citigroup’s efforts to wind down its consumer and local commercial banking businesses in and exposure to Russia, as announced in August. At that time, Citigroup expected to incur $170 million in charges over the period of winding down.In October, the company said that it would end nearly all institutional banking services in Russia by the end of first-quarter 2023.Our TakeFor a long time now, Citigroup has been emphasizing growth in core businesses through streamlining operations internationally. The bank has said that it will wind down its UK retail banking business, and expand personal banking and wealth management businesses in the region.In January 2022, the bank revealed plans to exit the consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico. This is in addition to its major strategic action announced in April 2021 to exit the consumer banking business in 13 markets across Asia and EMEA, including Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia and Korea.Since then, Citigroup has signed deals to sell consumer businesses in Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam and India. It has also completed the sale of the Bahrain, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and Philippines consumer businesses. Citigroup is also ahead of its plans to gradually wind down the consumer banking business in South Korea.Such exits will free up capital and help the company pursue investments in wealth management operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London to stoke growth. These efforts will likely help augment the company’s profitability and efficiency over the long term.Over the past year, shares of Citigroup have lost 24.5% compared with a decline of 20.3% recorded by the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Citigroup carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Gallagher AJG, Willis Tower Watson plc and Brown &amp; Brown Inc. BRO.Industry: Insurance BrokerageLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2028087/5-insurance-brokers-to-watch-amid-industry-headwindsBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher, Willis Tower Watson plc and Brown &amp; Brown Inc.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests, against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity.Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed health care services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to grow to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesGovernment-undertaken initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Per Deloitte Insights, The Swiss Re Institute projects an increase in demand for insurance, which, in turn, will drive a 3.9% increase in premiums in 2022.Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, signifies dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current year has moved down 0.3% in a year’s time.Before we present a few insurance broker stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Both S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Insurance Brokerage industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the Zacks Finance Sector over the past year.Though the industry has lost 4.2%, the loss was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's decrease of 17.4% and the broader sector’s decline of 11.6% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.82X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.48X and the sector's 3.41X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 7.98X, as low as 4.22X and at the median of 5.93X.5 Insurance Brokerage Stocks to Keep an Eye OnWe are presenting five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies MMC, Aon plc AON, Arthur J. Gallagher AJG, Willis Tower Watson plc WLTW and Brown &amp; Brown Inc. BRO.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests, against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed health care services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to grow to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government-undertaken initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Per Deloitte Insights, The Swiss Re Institute projects an increase in demand for insurance, which, in turn, will drive a 3.9% increase in premiums in 2022. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, signifies dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

If you want to read about some more gambling countries, go directly to 5 Biggest Gambling Countries In The World.Gambling, also known as betting, involves wagering something of value, with an uncertain outcome on the line. Gambling is generally referred to as a combination of consideration, risk, and a prize. A few examples include instant lotteries, Bingo, betting on billiards or pool, card games, and casino games. Globally, gambling is perceived as a harmless or low-risk social activity for participants of all ages. Teenagers engage in both regulated and non-regulated forms of gambling. Gambling is one of the biggest industries in the world. The commercial casino industry has seen significant growth over the last few decades as licensed casinos have expanded to new markets and generated record-breaking revenue figures. According to a recent report, the market size of the casino and online gambling industry worldwide reached a total of $231 billion in 2021. Online gambling alone is expected to exceed $114 billion in size before the end of this decade, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 11% over the forecast period that runs up to 2028. Rapid urbanization is one of the key factors driving the growth of the market, in addition to the increasing penetration of the internet across the globe. Furthermore, legalization and the cultural approval of online betting in various developed countries is also providing a boost to the gambling market. Online sports companies are also attaining high-profile sponsorships with various football and racing clubs, helping attract new users. Convenient access to online casinos through mobile phones is also creating a positive impact. Some of the biggest gambling companies in the world include Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). These operate in some of the biggest gambling hubs in the world found in countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and China, among others discussed in detail below. Even though the pandemic brought the industry to a standstill, the gambling market has recovered and is on the growth track once again. Story continuesOur MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the gambling industry. The countries are ranked according to the gambling gross win in each country, as assessed by H2 Gambling Capital. The details of each gambling country are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. 15 Biggest Gambling Countries In The WorldPixabay/Public DomainBiggest Gambling Countries In The World15. NetherlandsTotal Gambling Gross Win: $3 Billion Gambling in the Netherlands is regulated by the gaming authority, KSA, which enforces provisions of the Dutch Gambling Act of 1964. The Holland Casino is one of the biggest gambling firms in the country but has reduced in popularity in recent years as the focus shifts away from physical stores to online gambling. The Netherlands has steadily become one of the biggest gambling countries in the world over the past few years. It has a rich history in the betting world. One of the oldest lotteries of the world, called Staatsloterij, has been played in the country since 1726. The Netherlands has popular casinos such as Haarlemmermeerse Bos, Holland Casino Valkenburg, Holland Casino Venlo, and Gran Casino Tiel. The country is working to make flexible legislation and focus on the internet gaming sector to achieve higher tax revenues from local and international operators and players in the gambling universe. Just like Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in the US, the Netherlands is home to some of the biggest gambling establishments in the world. 14. RussiaTotal Gambling Gross Win: $4 Billion     Russia, one of the largest countries in the world with an area of 6,612,074 sq miles and population of 144 million, is gradually becoming one of the leading gambling countries in the world as well. The country had strict legislation regarding gambling during the former Soviet Union in the 1920s, but these were eased during the 1990s. Online gambling is prohibited in the country, but the land based gambling market has been thriving since 1987. Some of the prominent land-based gambling casinos in Russia are Kazino Sochi, Shambhala Casino, Casino Sobranie, ltai Palace Casino, and Crystal and Tigre De Cristal Resort &amp; Casino. These casinos are based in few of the regions where the government has allowed gambling. Russia has attracted tourists and locals to take part in these gambling activities as these casinos are some of Europe’s finest ones, offering a wide variety of games to the players.13. PhilippinesTotal Gambling Gross Win: $5 Billion The Philippines has become one of the best tourist spots for gambling over the years. The gambling sector is governed and controlled by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, which is the country’s government-owned department. The country, with 115 million population and an area of 115,831 sq miles, has several casino resort businesses. The tourists are attracted to the country for not only its beautiful islands but also casinos, such as Resorts World, and City of Dreams, among others. There are more than fifty casinos, private and publicly-owned, in the country. The popular games, Sabong and e-Sabong, have continued to generate $1 billion in revenue for gambling companies every year, and hold a cultural importance for the locals.12. SingaporeTotal Gambling Gross Win: $6 Billion   Singapore is one the leading gambling countries in the world, although it is also one of the smallest in terms of overall area and population, with 5.8 million population and an area of 277 square miles. Singapore Pools, which is a state-sponsored lottery company, was founded in 1968 and got permission to begin sports betting as well. This led towards more revenue generation for the government, which gradually made more gambling-friendly laws. The government recently awarded two casino licenses, to the Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands, which are some of the biggest casinos in the world. The latter, popular as a resort for multi-millionaires, has over 2,500 gaming machines. The country has one of the highest annual gambling losses per person in the world.11. SpainTotal Gambling Gross Win: $10 Billion     Spain, with an area of 195,364 square miles and population of 47 million, is one of the biggest gambling countries in the world with a rich history in gambling. Many former emperors and their families were obsessed with gambling and lotteries. The country legalized gambling in 1981, although it had been popular as a sport for centuries. It is estimated that almost 80% of adults in the country play the popular Christmas lottery game called El Gordo which generates almost $1 billion every year. Spain is also one of the leading markets for the sports betting industry. Major international sports events, such as the Spanish Grand Prix and Madrid Masters, attract many sports bettors. There is the traditional bullfighting every year as well that makes the country more famous in the gambling and betting markets. 10. South KoreaTotal Gambling Gross Win: $11 Billion South Korea is one of the leading gambling countries in the world with a population of 51 million and an area of 38,623 sq miles. However, casinos and sports betting continue to be a risky venture in the country due to strict legislations. In recent years, the country has allowed leniency towards land-based gambling casinos for tourists and expatriate residents. Notably, the gambling market in the country includes casinos, lotteries, bingo, poker and betting. The popular land-based casinos are Seven Luck Casino Gangbuk, Paradise City Casino, Seven Luck Casino Busan Lotte, and Majestar Casino Jeju Island, among many more which attract tourists from around the world.9. FranceTotal Gambling Gross Win: $13 Billion     France, with an area 212,900 square miles and population of 67 million, holds a prominent place in the gambling industry of the world. It is famous for its casinos, especially in Paris and Cannes. There are over 300 casinos in the country, which makes it one of the leading gambling countries in the world. Other than gambling casinos, the country hosts sporting events such as the French Open, the Tour De France and the Rugby Six, which have attracted the sports betting industry. Moreover, high profile horse races, such as Chantilly, take place in France. The country also has some of the best poker players in the world. The gambling laws in the country are some of the most lenient in Europe. 8. CanadaTotal Gambling Gross Win: $14 Billion  Canada is one of the biggest gambling countries in the world, with an area of 3.8 million square miles and population of 38 million. It is rated one of the best places to live with a high quality of life. One of the reasons why the gambling industry is thriving in the area is because of a stable economy. The country is home to gambling and sports betting, with studies claiming that 75% of adult Canadians have gambled once in their lives. Notably, lottery tickets are attached to Christmas gifts, which show the importance of lottery games in the local culture. Furthermore, Canadians have a liking for American sports, such as Ice Hockey, which has increased sports betting in the country. Several other winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding tournaments, also play a major role in sports betting.7. GermanyTotal Gambling Gross Win: $16 Billion Germany, with a population of 83 million and area of 137,847 sq miles, is known as one of the leading gambling countries of the world. Germany has recently liberalized the German Gaming Law (GGL). The changes mean that private gambling operators have been permitted to offer their service on the German market, but through proper licensing. Some of the biggest casinos in the country include DUISBURG, BADEN-BADEN, Berlin, Hamburg, and Konstanz. Online sports betting and online gaming are on the rise in the country as well. There are more than 400 gambling establishments in the country, which include land-based casinos with resorts. Poker games are considered favorite games in German casinos, such as Omaha, Texas Hold-em and Seven Card Stud.6. AustraliaTotal Gambling Gross Win: $18 Billion  Australia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and the stability has allowed for citizens to explore recreational avenues to spend their money. New South Wales is the most popular gambling region in the country and also has the highest number of casinos. Notably, the slot machines and poker games are most popular among Australians. Not only gambling, but sports betting also has a major contribution to the economy. International sports events, such the Australian Open and the Ashes, have their own sports betting markets. In addition to Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in the US, Australia is home to some of the biggest gambling establishments in the world.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Gambling Countries In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc. While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that valuations are supportive.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, MACOM Technology and Microchip.About The IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Major Trends Driving the IndustryMost companies in this industry are positioned for strong growth this year followed by difficult comps and weaker demand in the next. It is the net effect of these companies being still somewhat behind schedule in delivering to the post-pandemic rush in demand. This in turn is because of supply chain disruption (which continues for most), driven by the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the more recent COVID shutdowns in China. Supply constraints also impact profitability as it may be necessary to idle capacity despite demand being out there. Going into 2023, some segments are seeing orders slow down or get rescheduled, which along with the slight uptick in cancellations, points to increasing caution at customers. But many of these companies have long term agreements stretching well into 2023, which means that any softness could take longer to show up in the results.Story continues The increasing use of electronics in vehicles, airplanes and defense equipment; increased factory automation; greater penetration of smartphones, tablets, notebooks, PCs and all manner of personal computing and other personal devices and smart household appliances; communications infrastructure moving to 5G; greater reliance on cloud infrastructure; the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), more advanced medical devices, EVs, self-driving cars etc continue to expand the addressable market for semiconductor chips. The constantly expanding addressable market makes this a very attractive industry for long-term investment. This is particularly true because the industry is capacity constrained based on today’s level of digitization, but this digitization is expected to increase manifold over the next decade because of the adoption of AI, EV and other emerging technologies. Additionally, the breadth of  markets and applications ensure that even if some segments (like consumer/computing) see demand pullbacks, emerging areas like AI, EV, IoT, etc. balance them out.    The post-pandemic hybrid model, where more people move out of their homes more often but not all the time, is leading to an expansion of the overall electronic footprint of the consumer/computing segment. Near-term challenges here are related to strong uptake in the last couple of years. But there are other opportunities, including the metaverse and consumer devices incorporating newer technologies to enable more experiences. The number of semiconductors per device and their complexities also continue to increase, thus supporting demand. The adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, is another boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology enables in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials are increasing. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it is not totally replacing 4G but supplementing it, thus adding to component demand. Industry consolidation is important because the cost and complications of making chips rises in an environment where the adoption of semiconductors in devices of varying value requires prices to decline. Acquisitions are also driven by the need to expand R&amp;D capabilities and to acquire key talent.                              U.S. government officials worry that none of the most advanced chips are currently manufactured in the country. This is considered to be a national security concern given that semiconductors are playing an increasingly larger role in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. How exactly this situation will play out for the industry is unknown. Increasing capacity would depress prices. And U.S. production would increase cost. So much depends on the government’s contribution (perhaps through the CHIPS Act). In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technologysector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #187, which places it in the bottom 25% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates uncertain near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.However, despite the industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries, the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate, is positive. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year. it appears that analyst opinion has significantly improved: 2022 estimates have risen 26.9% over the past year, while 2023 estimates have risen 2.9%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance Is AttractiveSince April, the Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It has however traded at a slight discount to the S&amp;P 500 though much of this period.Overall, the industry lost 13.6% of its value over the past year while the broader sector lost 33.2% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 17.0%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 16.96X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500’s 17.72X and the broader computer and technology sector’s 20.67X. At the current level, it is also trading below its median level of 16.96X over the past year.The industry has traded between its lowest point of 13.80X and highest point of 24.11X over the past year.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks To Hold for the Long-TermMicrochip Technology Incorporated MCHP: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity, and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where the company is seeing supply constraints. This is also stretching out lead times and forcing the company to idle capacity, which hurts its profitability. Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently bought back a substantial number of shares and earlier this year, the board announced a 37.8% increase in the dividend.Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders. Microchip beat estimates by 1.4% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has increased 24 cents (4.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate increased 6 cents (1.0%) during the same period.#2 (Buy) ranked Microchip’s shares are down 11.5% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MCHP Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI: Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Management is optimistic about near-term strength based on stabilizing orders, a strong backlog and continued design win momentum. Additionally, the increased scale and diversification, flexibility of its manufacturing model, and strengthening brand value are expected to help it navigate the economic downturn. This strength has allowed it to generate all-time high fourth-quarter revenues in the industrial, automotive and communications markets, as well as relatively modest growth in consumer. Analog Devices pays a regular dividend, and it increased the payout on a per share basis by over 10%.The company beat October quarter estimates by 5.8% and in the last 60 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased 28 cents (2.9%).

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Monolithic Power has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MCHP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MCHP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.01, while MPWR has a forward P/E of 31.78. We also note that MCHP has a PEG ratio of 0.80. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MPWR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.27.Another notable valuation metric for MCHP is its P/B ratio of 6.97. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MPWR has a P/B of 12.01.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCHP's Value grade of B and MPWR's Value grade of D.MCHP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MPWR, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MCHP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

34,43d8b4bb-9acf-33a9-9f19-e116a8d85bae,MCHP,2022-12-14,10 Best Performing Stocks in November,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-performing-stocks-november-143332421.html,1670942012,STORY,"['WYNN', 'BA', 'ABMD', 'MCHP', 'SEDG', '^GSPC', 'FCX', 'AMD', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best performing stocks in November. If you want to read about some more best performing stocks in November, go directly to 5 Best Performing Stocks in November.After the eventful month of October, which is widely known for stock market crashes, the United States (US) stock market jumped back on a revival path in November, generally considered one of the best months of the year for investors. The relative performance of stocks during the month, compared to the year, which has been the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 in more than a decade, revived hopes of a market rally at the turn of the year. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose by more than 5% in November, up 14% compared to the beginning of October. The month of November is also renowned for Black Friday sales, a day on which big national retailers put inventories on sale. This November, on Black Friday, the shopping crowds and sales were better compared to last year, according to some estimates, although they still fell short of the traffic seen before the advent of the pandemic. Overall, sales for US retail outlets increased by 2.3% year-on-year to a record $9.1 billion. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), 196.7 million Americans went shopping over the Black Friday weekend. The NRF report claims that this was nearly a 9.4% increase from last year’s 179.8 million shoppers. Moreover, Adobe Analytics reported that online sales on Cyber Monday totaled $11.3 billion, up 5.8% from 2021 and Black Friday online sales were $9.12 billion, 2.3% above 2021’s $8.92 billion. The gain that the S&amp;P 500 registered in November brought the losses year-to-date for the index to around 14.3% at the end of November. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.67% during the time and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 jumped 5.95%.Heading into 2023, it is likely that interest rates will rise, though slower than previously expected, despite peak inflation. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which discourages companies from borrowing and investing to expand their businesses. This results in a macro slowdown for investors, and even earnings growth tends to stagnate. Some of the best-performing stocks despite these concerns in November included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that registered a more than 20% gain in share price in November were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Best Performing Stocks in NovemberSource: pexelsBest Performing Stocks in November10. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23     Gain in Share Price in November: 31%Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) designs, develops and operates integrated resorts.

On October 31, Wynn Resorts Ltd shares soared after billionaire Tilman Fertitta acquired a 6.1% stake in the hotel and casino company.On December 7, Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski maintained a Buy rating on Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock and raised the price target to $109 from $85, noting that the company represents one of the most attractive investment possibilities given the significant underperformance over the last 24 months combined with favorable expectations.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 23 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $191.6 million in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), compared to 26 in the previous quarter worth $142.8 million.Just like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is one of the stocks that registered an impressive gain in November.In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.”9. Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34     Gain in Share Price in November: 49%Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) engages in the research, development, and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart. On November 1, Johnson &amp; Johnson, an American multinational corporation, said that it would buy Abiomed in a $16.6 billion deal. J&amp;J’s offered an upfront payment of $380 per share, representing a 50.7% premium to Abiomed’s last closing price. The share of Abiomed rose about 50% in premarket trade.On October 10, Piper Sandler analyst Matt O'Brien maintained an Overweight rating on Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) stock and lowered the price target to $350 from $425, noting that models in medical technology had to be updated to account for several considerations, such as inflationary pressures and currency headwinds that had not been adequately captured.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1 billion in Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD), compared to 30 in the preceding quarter worth $1.04 billion.8. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42   Gain in Share Price in November: 25%The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems, and services worldwide. On December 8, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers maintained an Overweight rating on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) stock and raised the price target to $218 from $185, noting that the company's free cash flow can exceed its 2025-2026 target on very low investment and relatively mature mix of programs producing at a high rate.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 42 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $691.7 million in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), compared to 51 in the preceding quarter worth $1.5 billion. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favour The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped-up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44     Gain in Share Price in November: 30%SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) designs, develops and sells direct current (DC) optimized inverter systems for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide. On December 5, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne maintained an Outperform rating on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) stock and raised the price target to $360 from $309, highlighting that the company is well positioned to benefit from secular solar demand driven by policy and higher electricity rates.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 44 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $673.8 million in SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), compared to 40 in the previous quarter worth $749.4 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition. High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 6. Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45     Gain in Share Price in November: 28%Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. On November 4, Microchip Technology shares were higher after its FQ2 earnings destroyed the general agreement mark. The revenue of the company grew 26% from the prior year and net income growth was 39% higher than in the same period of the last year. On November 29, Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg maintained a Buy rating on Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) stock and raised the price target to $80 from $77, noting that the company reiterated its quarterly guidance initially issued on November 3 and reaffirmed its March quarter sequential growth expectations.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Sydney-based investment firm Platinum Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) with 4 million shares worth more than $245.3 million. Along with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) is one of the stocks that registered an impressive gain in November.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Madison Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We initiated a new investment in Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP). A microchip is a global provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductor chips. These products are near-ubiquitous in our daily lives, whether we know it or not. They serve as the embedded brains of all sorts of electronic devices and end products that are increasingly smart and connected to the internet, such as cars, phones, kitchen appliances, factory equipment, and so on. Importantly, microcontrollers and analog chips represent a small percentage of the end product bill of materials, yet account for a disproportionately large portion of the performance characteristics of that product. Product cycles and customer retention are very long, as once designed into a product, Microchip is rarely replaced. Growth should be well above average for many years given the increasing electronification around us. In addition, management has announced its intention to return a sizeable portion of its cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We like this dual threat of growth together with excess cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Stocks in November. Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy20 Countries That Produce the Most Electric Power15 Countries That Produce the Most OilDisclosure.

And these days, you don’t have to buy a house to get a piece of the action.Check out real estate investment trusts, which are publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate.REITs collect rent from their properties and pass it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. That means investors don’t have to worry about screening tenants, fixing damages or chasing down late payments. Instead, they simply sit back and enjoy the dividend checks rolling in when they pick a winning REIT.Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic did impact some commercial real estate. And not all REITs are the same. If you are a landlord for e-commerce giant Amazon, for instance, you should have no problem collecting a steady stream of rental income.With that in mind, let’s take a look at two REITs paying oversized dividends to investors — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash.Don’t missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classChances are good you're overpaying for home insurance. Here's how to spend less on peace of mindAmazon’s landlordThe first one is STAG Industrial (STAG), a REIT that owns and operates single-tenant industrial properties throughout the U.S. Its biggest tenant is Amazon.The company’s portfolio consists of 563 buildings totaling approximately 112 million rentable square feet across 41 states.Note that about 460 of those properties are warehouses, which happen to be an essential part of e-commerce.Moreover, a tenant survey in 2021 revealed that around 40% of the REIT’s portfolio handles e-commerce activity.To see how solid STAG Industrial is, take a look at its dividend history.Since the company went public in 2011, it has paid higher regular dividends every single year.Story continuesWhile most dividend-paying companies follow a quarterly distribution schedule, STAG Industrial pays shareholders every month. The monthly dividend rate stands at 12.7 cents per share, which translates to an annual yield of 4.2%.STAG Industrial shares are down 18% over the past 12 months.Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets insteadWalmart’s landlordWhen it comes to paying monthly dividends, one company stands out above all — Realty Income (O).Realty Income has been paying uninterrupted monthly dividends since its founding in 1969. That’s 630 consecutive monthly dividends paid.Better yet, since the company went public in 1994, it has announced 118 dividend increases.Realty Income has a diverse portfolio of over 11,700 commercial properties located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the UK and Spain. It leases them to around 1,100 different tenants operating across 79 industries.This means even if one tenant or industry enters a downturn, the impact on company-level financials will likely be limited.For instance, while Realty Income rents some properties to AMC Theaters — whose business was hurt by COVID-19 — it also has Walgreens, FedEx and Walmart as some of its top tenants. And these businesses turned out to be largely pandemic-proof.Earlier this month, the REIT announced a monthly cash dividend to 24.85 cents per share, giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 4.4%.Realty Income shares are down just 2% over the past year.What to read next'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysWant to invest your spare change but don't know where to start?

Behind its quiet facade lies a warren of workshops where modern machines melt metals and thump out money.""At the moment, every gold coin that comes off the coining press has already been sold,"" said Starsich. ""Right now we could sell three times as many as we are able to produce.""The Mint's shop, a modern corner of the building, has had a long queue outside daily for months. Among those standing in line was pensioner Renate, one of the few willing to talk about her purchasing habits.""I'm from an older generation. Whenever things get a bit uncertain we come back to gold coins and tell ourselves we'll always be able to sell them,"" she said. ""Gold has that safety factor.""Starsich said customers were of all ages and from all walks of life. Around a third of the Mint's sales are to foreign buyers.The Mint was founded in 1194 to strike coins from the silver paid as a ransom for Richard the Lionheart, after he had been seized and held captive by enemies near Vienna.Today, the Mint says its one-ounce Philharmonic gold coin, named after the world famous Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, is the top-selling gold bullion coin in Europe and Japan.HOARDERSAustria is a financially conservative country in which the public hoards cash and gold in times of crisis. The Mint says demand for gold is the highest it has been since it took on its current form in 1989.The Austrian National Bank, which owns the Mint, said in a presentation on Austrian households' finances in October that more gold had been bought in the two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic started than in the five years before that.Story continuesIt noted demand for gold in the first half of this year was higher even than in the first half of 2020, ""despite rising prices"", suggesting a rush to an asset seen as a safe haven.""It's a cascade,"" Starsich said of the causes. ""It started with the corona crisis, with the pandemic, when people were unsettled. Then in February Russia invaded Ukraine. That boosted sales again. And then the rising inflation over the summer/autumn, which increased sales further slightly.""This year at the end of November the Mint had sold more than 1.8 million ounces of gold and was approaching the record of more than 2 million set in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Sales in December are usually strong as gold is a traditional Christmas gift.Starsich added that the rush to gold was a global phenomenon seen at other major national mints. The gold price is currently around $1,800 an ounce, short of its peaks above $2,000 in March of this year and August 2020.He said he believed more Austrians were seeking to include gold in their portfolios as a hedge against stocks or to diversify their portfolios. Many analysts doubt the usefulness of gold to counter inflation, however.(Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)]"

This “loss of trust” followed the failure of many centralized entities, and is reflected in exchange-traded product (ETP) flows, which have remained negative throughout the year, the report said.Against a broader macro backdrop of inflation concerns, rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, total crypto market cap has declined by about 61% compared to an 18% drop for the S&amp;P 500 index, the report added.The bank says the bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital were failures of centralized entities rather than decentralized entities, “perhaps signifying the resilience of decentralized finance protocols.” Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.Bitcoin open interest saw a significant decline, the note said. It started the year at more than $23 billion and has dropped to around $9 billion. Leverage has also largely declined. Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by investors and represents active positions.The bank notes there is still over $150 billion in market cap across stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency saw only 5% net redemptions in 2022. However, relative declines show different investor behavior and diverging confidence in stablecoins, with tether (USDT) losing as much as $10 billion in market cap, while USD coin (USDC) stayed roughly level and Binance USD (BUSD) increased.Spot trading volumes have remained resilient despite falling crypto prices, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have grown in recent weeks following the collapse of FTX. The demise of FTX has “further bolstered policymaker calls for crypto regulation, placing a greater emphasis on consumer protection,” according to the note.Read more: Goldman Sachs Sees Gold Outperforming Bitcoin in the Longer Term]"

The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday also showed core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and fuel costs, increasing 6% versus expectations of 6.2% and offered additional evidence that the U.S. central bank's monetary hawkishness during the past six months has been working.U.S. Treasury yields, which hovered above 4% just a few months ago, sank to 3.5% on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Fed is likely to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its streak of four straight 75 bps increases.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried was remanded to custody and will face an extradition hearing on Feb. 8, 2023. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed the indictment earlier on Tuesday, announcing that officials were charging Bankman-Fried with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and campaign violation allegations, among other alleged crimes. FTX collapsed last month after CoinDesk found irregularities in its balance sheet.In a Tweet on Tuesday, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao wrote that he welcomed a “stress test” of withdrawals on his exchange to address rising user redemption requests from the platform.Of cryptos' Tuesday price surge, Bob Ras, co-founder of exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, noted cautiously in an email to CoinDesk that the bounce was not ""as substantial as many had hoped for.""""This isn’t to say there won’t be more upside for major crypto assets here soon. It’s certainly possible, if not likely,"" he wrote, adding that the emergence of China from its Covid lockdowns, could affect inflation in the months ahead.""There’s just too much uncertainty for a full-blown market breakout for crypto assets and equities that are further along the risk curve,” he wrote.Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorAvalancheAVAX+5.7%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+3.9%Smart Contract PlatformChainlinkLINK+3.5%ComputingBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorLoopringLRC−0.9%Smart Contract PlatformStellarXLM−0.5%Smart Contract PlatformGalaGALA−0.1%EntertainmentInsightsBy Sam ReynoldsThe South Korean city of Busan seems hell-bent on being a blockchain hub. But will anyone care about its government enterprise blockchain initiatives and quest to build the first city-run crypto exchange?Part of Busan’s status as the ""center of a global digital information ecosystem,"" as government literature describes it, is to integrate blockchain technology into all facets of government service. That means, according to The Korea Herald, that blockchain will be the technology that powers the city’s blockchain-based ID service called B-Pass, B-Fresh, its seafood logistics service, B-Tour, a tour platform, to name a few.The problem is this initiative represents yesterday’s thinking on blockchain. Others have tried integrating permissioned enterprise blockchain into digital infrastructure, and it has failed. A few weeks ago, CoinDesk reported that two major enterprise blockchain projects were ending: Shipping giant Maersk and IBM abandoned TradeLens, a blockchain solution for optimizing supply chains, while the Australian Stock Exchange said it was abandoning a blockchain-powered clearing and settlement system because of a poor cost-benefit ratio.“It’s a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on. And once the pixie dust kind of wears off, the value proposition doesn’t look so hot,” Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consulting giant Ernst &amp; Young, told CoinDesk in a previous article.This is on top of IBM’s blockchain team being effectively wound down in early 2021, and Microsoft discontinuing its Azure cloud services for blockchain a few months later.It isn’t exactly clear how the powers that be in Busan will do anything differently that could change the equation on enterprise blockchain. It’s probably that they can’t.Blockchain remains slowThe reason why there hasn’t been a success story in this field is that the technology itself is slow compared to other database platforms.“The problem was the cost in computing power to implement. Blockchain technology is slow and requires a great deal more computer power. Blockchain is the Model T of distributed ledger technology. They are amazing but now dated,” explained Burke Files, a consultant, when asked about why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration isn’t implementing blockchain technology as it once claimed.Busan’s other blockchain venture is the creation of a government-run crypto exchange. In a recent announcement from the city, authorities said that the project had some setbacks, but its still on track for a launch next year.Setbacks indeed. FTX was an early contractor on the project, but that’s obviously not going to work now that the exchange has collapsed and the former CEO has been arrested.Binance and Huobi are also involved, but there’s been little to show for what should be a very simple project.Even if it's built, will anyone want to use it? There will certainly be benefits for traders when it comes to Korean won on-ramps and expedited know-your-customer procedures. But will people be comfortable trading on a government-run platform? It’s a fiat exchange, and many will no doubt find it antithetical to Satoshi’s vision for crypto.Busan might also be opening itself to some major headaches via liabilities.What if the exchange is hacked? Or what if a listed token is the victim of a rug pull? When dealing with offshore exchanges this can add a level of complexity, but serving the city of Busan with a legal notice will be a lot easier for a Korean lawyer then tracking down an exchange that’s registered in Seychelles but has no central office.Of course, the whole thing could be a Potemkin Village designed to look like busy work and extract dollars from tax payers. When CoinDesk visited the Busan blockchain center in August, it was just a co-working space with a handful of people. Hardly indicative of the makings of a global technology hub.Important events3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Great Britain Consumer Price Index (YoY/Nov)3:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(19:00 UTC) United States Fed Interest Rate Decision5:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(21:45 UTC) New Zealand Gross Domestic Product (YoY/Q3)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas, SEC Charges Former FTX CEO With Defrauding InvestorsAs the world watches, major events impacting crypto are unfolding simultaneously.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3%.The slowdown could give the Federal Reserve cover to start scaling back the size of its interest rate increases on Wednesday.""This month's report provides confirmation of October's step down in inflation pressures and is welcome news for the Fed,"" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday morning.""Tomorrow's reduction in the pace of tightening to 50 (basis points) was already telegraphed, and with the downtrend in inflation becoming entrenched, the FOMC can set its sights squarely on the labor market.""Wall Street stocks jumped on the news in morning trading but then pulled back to more modest gains by the afternoon.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.74% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1%. Winners included energy stocks and Moderna Inc , which surged nearly 20% on promising skin cancer vaccine study results.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.3% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained about 1%, a pullback from larger gains earlier in the day.""It was good news on the inflation front, but the equity market is giving back gains as it reflects on, 'what now?'"" Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management's Chief Investment Strategist, said in an email.""It's all a balancing act, which we believe points to near-term choppy markets even though the improving inflation backdrop adds a positive bias.""Story continuesBOND YIELDS, DOLLAR DIPU.S. Treasury yields dropped on the November inflation data.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 9.2 basis points to 3.519%; 30-year yields fell 3.2 basis points to 3.544%, and two-year yields, which typically move in step with interest rate expectations, dropped 16.4 basis points to 4.239%.The dollar also declined, dropping nearly 1% against a basket of major currencies. It is now down more than 5% over the last three months on investor belief that U.S. inflation has peaked.The pound gained against the dollar, up about 0.75% to $1.236. Data showed a rise in UK unemployment and an increase in wage growth that will keep Bank of England (BoE) policymakers on edge when they meet this week.The BoE, Fed and European Central Bank are expected to raise rates by 50 basis points (bps), rather than the 75 bps hikes they delivered earlier in the year.""If data such as today's suggest a real trend that the momentum of inflation is lower, we could then see the Fed pause over the next few months at a still restrictive policy-rate, but not one which would put potentially excessive pressure on the economy,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, said in a statement.Traders are now betting on 25-basis-point increases at each of the Fed's first two meetings of 2023 and no more, with some chance the last hike could come in May instead of March, bringing the policy rate to between 4.75% and 5%.COMMODITIES UPOil rallied for a second day, having jumped 2.5% on Monday, with U.S. crude up 3.12% to $75.45 per barrel and Brent at $80.68, up 3.45% on the day. The market was buoyed by concern about supply disruptions, including the ongoing shutdown of the Canada-to-U.S. Keystone crude pipeline following a massive leak.Gold, which is sensitive to shifts in U.S. inflation, also gained, with spot gold up 1.6% to $1,810.26 an ounce and U.S. gold futures up 1.77% to $1,813.90 an ounce.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin climbed around 3.4% to $17,750, and crypto-related stocks gained, even as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged by U.S. regulators, and Binance registered $1.9 billion of withdrawals in the past 24 hours.(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne in Boston and Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by Grant McCool and Rosalba O'Brien)]"

Crypto and freedom advocates should ensure decentralization as a principle is enshrined, and cooperate to realize and expand on Nikola Tesla’s vision of a decentralized, ubiquitous network.In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse found themselves in an ideological battle over the future of electricity. Threatened by Tesla and Westinghouse’s widely adopted alternating currents (AC) power system, Edison built out his direct-current (DC) stations, while deploying ruthless public relations campaigns to undermine his rivals’ credibility. As the three men urgently took their products to market and built out supporting infrastructure, corporations on the periphery also competed for market share, including Brush Electricity Company – which installed its arc lighting solutions in key regions including New York City.Tim Kravchunovsky is the Founder and CEO of Chirp. A graduate of Columbia University’s Masters Program, he has over 20 years experience as a network engineer and previously consulted for the World Bank.The AC system won out and became the gold standard underlying all electrification. An important lesson remains for those developing new architecture: The best technology can triumph only when it is also widely adopted.After developing the AC system, Tesla devoted much of his life to revolutionizing wireless electricity. The inventor envisioned infinite energy via a global network of towers that would electrify the world without wires. While investors including J.P. Morgan initially backed Tesla’s venture based on his past success with AC electricity, they later cut funding – a system handing such power over to end users, independent of the large companies who clashed during the “War of the Currents,” was too radical for many to handle at the time, and the technology wasn’t in place yet.Story continuesTesla died penniless in New York City, but his vision of ubiquitous energy run across a decentralized wireless system has served as inspiration for scientists, entrepreneurs and world leaders. Founders need to think carefully about the incentive structures that go into building such a system, while resisting centralized parties looking to co-opt its mechanisms under their own infrastructures – the blockchain sector in particular is in a unique position to guard against these attempts.While there is heroism in Elon Musk – an heir to Tesla’s legacy – stepping in to provide Starlink to Ukrainian citizens, there are also warnings that founders should note. Following Starlink’s deployment, Musk walked back his initial support for the cause and threatened to withdraw the program unless the U.S. Defense Department footed the bill. Although Musk also walked back these comments and kept Starlink operational in the region, the reversal revealed an incentive structure based on geopolitics, profit margins, and a billionaire’s impulses – which millions of innocent people suddenly found themselves tethered to. Musk is hardly an outlier when it comes to the murky relationship between centralized vested interests and state power. Telecom companies provide troves of data on millions of users daily to government entities.As the original use case of blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows any individual – no matter their socioeconomic class or country of origin – to take custody of their money. When applied to IoT devices, broadband and telecommunications infrastructure, blockchain technology can bestow more universe digital rights, including the ability to access modern internet and phone services without being surveilled.In the current “builder’s market,” blockchain developers and founders need to pay closer attention to the developments unfolding across telecommunications, broadband and IoT, rather than speculative digital asset bubbles that, unfortunately, defined the space over the past few years. Whether it’s setting up routers to power decentralized wireless networks (following in the tradition of Satoshi Nakamoto sending himself test amounts of bitcoin), or writing interoperable code, the crypto community should apply the principles of decentralization to this next frontier, and work together to ensure the ubiquitous network as envisioned by Tesla can take hold on the same scale as the inventor’s AC gold standard.]"

(NYSE:CRM) stock gained 3.9% last week, insiders who sold US$106m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$173, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Salesforce Salesforce Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, sold US$53m worth of shares at a price of US$182 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$136). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Salesforce didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Salesforce insiders own 3.2% of the company, worth about US$4.3b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Salesforce Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Salesforce shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Salesforce insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

However, the pandemic after effects, rate hikes and supply-chain disruptions due to the ongoing Ukraine war are expected to slash the apparel industry CAGR by 3.8% and the market is projected to reach a share of $768.26 billion in 2026 at the CAGR of 6.1%. McKinsey opines that the luxury market is likely to outperform the rest of the apparel industry since wealthy shoppers’ shopping patterns are largely unaffected by market downturns. They forecast a growth rate for luxury fashion to be 5 to 10% in the US in 2023. As for the masses, the Consumer Pulse survey found that more US-based consumers have switched brands to find lower prices than at any other time since the pandemic. Of those that switched, more than a third went for private-label products and the 90% of them stated that they intend to incorporate this behavior into their routines.TrendsThe luxury clothing industry has been the strongest performer in the larger apparel market, with a 33% shareholder return relative to 9% in the value segment. However, athleisure-wear is fast rising in popularity among regular as well as luxury customers. Athleisure market generated a growth of about 20.3% from 2019-2021, as people worked from home and switched to a more casual and sports wardrobe during lockdowns. By comparison, the traditional apparel industry returns were 4.5% for the same period, per McKinsey.The athleisure market is expected to grow with a CAGR of nearly 7% from 2019 to 2026, per the Allied Market Research, reaching a market share of $257 billion.Key PlayersSome of the major brands in the clothing industry include Louis Vuitton, Prada and Burberry. Their apparel can be purchased from virtually all around the world, and online at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Story continuesLouis Vuitton generated close to $37 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022 according to the company's books.

She will become the first woman in the role.Mr Murray will move into a new senior role at News Corp, reporting to chief executive Robert Thompson.The reshuffle delivers further cross-pollination between Mr Murdoch’s businesses in the US and UK and will fuel ongoing speculation in media circles that Rebekah Brooks, News UK chief executive, is also being lined up for a senior role in New York.Allies of Mr Murdoch have suggested he was frustrated by The Wall Street Journal’s perceived failure in 2020 to aggressively pursue stories about President Biden’s son Hunter. Other outlets were credited with scoops involving a leaked cache of emails.Mr Thomson said Ms Tucker, who began her career in journalism at the Financial Times before joining the Murdoch stable in 2007, “will never knowingly be beaten to a scoop”.The Wall Street Journal is published by Dow Jones, while titles such as The Times and the Sun are overseen by News UK. All fall under the wider News Corp umbrella.It comes as 91-year-old Mr Murdoch explores a possible merger between News Corp and Fox, the US broadcaster behind Fox News, as he hands control of his empire to eldest son Lachlan.The change of role for Ms Tucker, who has led The Sunday Times since 2020, comes as it increasingly shares resources with its sister daily title to save costs and create a unified digital news service.Ben Taylor, current deputy editor of the Sunday Times, is said to be frontrunner for the role.Mr Murray joined Dow Jones in 1994 and has led the Wall Street Journal since June 2018. Last year The New York Times reported that he had clashed with Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, over the paper’s digital strategy. Dow Jones denied there had been friction.Story continuesMr Murdoch bought Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal in 2007 for $5bn, which even before the financial crisis was viewed as a full price. In contrast to radical changes imposed on his other brands he has struggled to put his stamp on the institution and its culture, however.A Special Committee was formed in agreement with its former owners, the billionaire Bancroft family, with a remit to safeguard editorial independence and ethical standards. It interviewed Ms Tucker prior to her appointment.She said: “As a long-time admirer and reader of the brilliant journalism of The Wall Street Journal, it is my honour to edit this great newspaper.“With some of the best writers and the wisest minds on its staff, this impactful publication continues to set the agenda and reach ever-wider digital audiences around the world. I look forward to working with Matt through the transition.”It came as The Guardian imposed a hiring freeze as it warned of slowdowns in advertising revenues and supporter growth, as well as rising costs.In an email to staff, Anna Bateson, chief executive of Guardian Media Group, said the company would implement a freeze on “all but essential” recruitment in non-editorial departments, while editorial hiring would continue to require senior approval.The newspaper will also cut back on discretionary spending such as travel and expenses with immediate effect.Ms Bateson said: “I realise this is a difficult message but I want to be completely transparent and work with everyone to protect the Guardian’s financial stability long-term.”]"

In the most recent quarter, the titles saw a 23% increase in digital subscriptions.“Matt is a superb journalist and leader who has overseen a peerless editorial team that fashioned success for the Journal during an era of extreme vulnerability for media companies and journalism,” Thomson said in announcing the changes Monday. “Emma is a brilliant, inspiring editor, with digital nous and the highest standards of integrity. She has been a thoughtful custodian of The Sunday Times and will bring verve and virtue to Dow Jones.”Murray has served as editor-in-chief of the WSJ and Dow Jones Newswires in June 2018. During that time, the Journal won the Pulitzer Prize in national reporting in 2019 for its coverage of hush-money payments to two women who alleged they had affairs with Donald Trump.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2022. This year’s inflation and continued interest rates hike were heavy on the markets. Analysts recommended investing in income-generating stocks because they could stabilize overall portfolios through dividends. Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”9.

In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently sued to block the deal. Competition watchdogs in the EU and in the UK have both launched probes of their own.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe acquisition would make the Redmond-based software company the third-largest video game maker in the world after Sony and Tencent. But Microsoft has repeatedly said it won’t take the titles off the market. To prove it, the firm even offered to sign a legally-binding consent decree with the FTC to provide Call of Duty games to rivals including Sony, for a decade, Microsoft president Brad Smith said at the annual shareholder meeting yesterday (Dec. 13). But the FTC apparently shot it down.“I’m disappointed that the FTC didn’t give us the opportunity to even sit down with the staff to even talk about our proposal, to even see if there was a solution there,” Smith said. “…If there’s one thing we all know, whether you’re a government, or a business, or a parent talking to your children, you will never solve a problem if you don’t try.”Microsoft’s Call of Duty is coming to Nintendo Switch, but Sony rejected the offerMicrosoft has forged a 10-year-deal with Nintendo to make Call of Duty available on the Kyoto-based company’s consoles, including Switch, and committed to make the first-person shooter video game franchise available to Valve Software’s online gaming platform Steam. However, these are not key players that derive much traffic from the title. The partner Microsoft needs to bag is Sony.Story continuesBut Sony has rejected the idea more than once.Back in September, PlayStation chief Jim Ryan criticized Microsoft’s offer to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends, calling it “inadequate on many levels.”The offer of an additional seven years to make the wildly popular game available on Sony’s console, as well as its Game Pass-style subscription service PlayStation Plus, didn’t moved the needle. Sony didn’t accept the proposal.While Microsoft downplays Call of Duty’s ability to impact the gaming industry’s makeup, Sony argues otherwise. In an Oct. 28 comment to UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Sony laid out various reasons why Call of Duty is different to the other games: It has the highest number of monthly active users among the top 10 gaming franchises in 2020 and 2021; it has a relentless release cycle; and it is unique among AAA games because of its popularity, loyalty, and the enormous resources Activision commits to developing the franchise.“Call of Duty is not replicable. Call of Duty is too entrenched for any rival, no matter how well equipped, to catch up,” the Japanese company said.Call of Duty, by the digits425 million: Lifetime unit sales for the Call of Duty franchise.$30 billion: Call of Duty series’ lifetime revenue.125 million: Registered players for CoD: Warzone since its launch in March 2020.650 million: Downloads Call of Duty: Mobile has generated since its launch in 2019.3,000: People working on the Call of Duty franchise.3-5 years: How long each release takes to developOver $300 million: Budget for each releaseMicrosoft’s take on the antitrust backlash, in the Microsoft president’s words“The FTC’s case is really based on a market that they’ve identified that they say has two companies and two products, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox. If you look at the global market, Sony has 70% of that market, and we have 30%. So the first thing a judge is going to have to decide is whether the FTC lawsuit is a case that will promote competition or is it really instead of a case that will protect the largest competitor from competition.” —Brad Smith during the Dec. 13 annual shareholder meetingRelated stories🤝 Microsoft’s Activision deal put it back in the US’s antitrust crosshairs🤖 Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard gives it the clear lead in the metaverse🧹 Activision is clearing out problematic staff before Microsoft’s $70 billion takeoverMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Microsoft has rejected the concerns, saying it would not make financial sense to shut out users on competing devices.Smith, speaking during Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting, said he was disappointed the FTC did not take more time to consider the consent decree proposal before suing.The FTC declined to comment on Smith's remarks but said generally that it is always willing to consider proposals.In a move to blunt criticism, Microsoft this month entered into a 10-year commitment to bring ""Call of Duty"" to Nintendo platforms. The company made the same offer to Sony.The FTC lawsuit threw a stumbling block in front of the tech giant's plans to rapidly expand its portfolio of popular games and catch up to bigger rivals.The deal is also facing scrutiny outside the United States. The European Union in November opened a full-scale investigation, while the EU competition watchdog said it would decide by March 23, 2023, whether to clear or block the deal.Britain's antitrust regulator said in September it would launch a full-scale probe.

With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2022.  Suggested articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy15 Countries That Produce the Most Oil10 Best December Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
83,50d7821f-536b-3e8d-a380-a66820556a8f,SIG,2022-12-14,5 Valuable Price-to-Book Stocks to Buy in December,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-valuable-price-book-stocks-112411457.html,1671017051,STORY,"['SIG', 'UNM', 'AER', 'CLS']","[There are several different ways to find value stocks. Among these, the most popular are the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which though used less often, is an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Celestica CLS, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Aercap AER and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.Story continuesBut there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F (1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world, serving the computer and communications sectors.Celestica has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A.

""Jewelry inherently holds its value, and customers know that. So they know that if they buy a nice piece of jewelry, it will be worth at least the same, if not have appreciated, a year later. So we see in tough times, even including recession, jewelry actually does much better than the rest of retail.""Drosos might be right in her assumption.During its fiscal third quarter, Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, delivered topline growth reaching $1.6 billion, with revenues up 2.9% year over year. The company struck an upbeat tone for the holidays on its earnings call, citing strength in website visits.Women shop for jewelry at the King of Prussia Mall, United States' largest retail shopping space, in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, U.S., December 8, 2018. REUTERS/Mark Makela""One of our strategies has been to lead digital commerce in the jewelry category,"" Drosos said. ""It's a category that traditionally was very brick-and-mortar based. People only went into a store so they could be consulted or try on the product. Now we're actually selling a lot of jewelry online, but [it's] mostly browsing. 67% of our customers go online before they come into the store.""In addition, Drosos explained that demand for lower-priced jewelry could possibly be waning as consumer trends change.""Last year was a big year for lower-priced jewelry,"" Drosos said. ""Stimulus was in the market, people really spending on themselves, which was great to see. Self-purchase tends to be a lower-priced purchase than bridal or romantic gifting, so we saw a big increase last year. That's been offset this year somewhat.""Signet dominates in the low- to mid-price jewelry business. The company owns brands including Jared, Kay, and Zales. It also acquired Blue Nile in October.Story continuesA customer looks at jewelry while shopping at Zales Jewelers at the Maine Mall on November 16, 2008. (Photo by Tim Greenway/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)""We're still up on a stack basis,"" Drosos noted. ""But we've seen lower-income customers be more challenged. You know, discretionary price increases are impacting their discretionary spend more so than higher-income customers.""Despite this, Drosos mentioned transaction value was up 8% in the quarter and up 27% versus three years ago. She said a major part of that was recognizing that lower-income customers would be more challenged and adjusting accordingly.""For that [lower-income] customer, we've added value-engineered product really to give them a great value, financing alternatives,"" Drosos said.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $17.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Signet Jewelers shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Signet Jewelers is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Retail - Jewelry industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $5.53 per share to $5.35 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Signet Jewelers right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

WBA is gaining from strategic collaborations and noteworthy product launches. The company ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The company’s long-term growth model looks encouraging. However, weak margins and stiff rivalry do not bode well.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 16.7% compared with 1.8% fall of the industry and a 15.6% plunge of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company has a market capitalization of $35.41 billion. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 10.6% on average. However, the company’s long-term projected growth rate of 3% remains behind the industry’s growth projection of 5.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayQ4 Upsides: Walgreens Boots exited fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Retail comp sales in the United States and Boots UK were both strong, with the United States up 6% and Boots up 19% over fiscal 2021. Several of the company’s initiatives continued to gain traction. U.S. digital sales grew 37% for the year on top of 74% growth in 2021. myWalgreens membership surge crossed a big milestone, reaching 102 million customers. Added to this, VillageMD and Blue Shields continued to realize tremendous top-line growth in 2022, driving pro forma total growth of 75% for the year.New Alliances Look Strategic: The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.The company is progressing well with respect to three major partnerships with VillageMD, Shields and CareCentrix. VillageMD is progressing with value-based care for the nation with over 340 clinics now open, including about 150 co-located with Walgreens Boots, with a target of 200 by the end of the calendar year 2022. Through the company’s accelerated rollout, VillageMD already covers 433,000 lives under value-based arrangements, including 161,000 Medicare and MA value-based lives. At the same time, CareCentrix has 19 million total contracted lives and Shields is partnered with 75 health systems.Story continuesProduct Launches: Walgreens Boots’ product launches in the past few months raise our optimism. In June 2022, Walgreens launched its clinical trial business to redefine the patient experience and bolster access and retention in sponsor-led drug development research. The new business will address patient recruitment and enrollment-related challenges in clinical trials, which were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn March 2022, Walgreens, in collaboration with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, announced the nationwide availability of “Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 at-home collection kit” at no cost to individuals who meet clinical guidelines.DownsidesPressure on Margin Continues: In the last few years, a slowdown in the generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. In addition, of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margin on a significant level.Competitive Landscape: Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2022 earnings has moved 3.6% down to $4.51.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1323.12 billion, suggesting a 0.3% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksFew other better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are ShockWave Medical, Inc.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar.

The Enterprise Visibility &amp; Mobility segment’s sales declined 8.8% year over year in the third quarter due to this headwind. Supply-chain constraints hurt North America and EMEA sales by 9% and 2%, respectively, in the third quarter.Given Zebra Technologies’ wide international presence, foreign currency headwinds are affecting revenues. Foreign currency translation had an adverse impact of 2.9% on sales in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the company expects a negative impact of 4 percentage-point from currency headwinds. A stronger U.S. dollar might continue to depress the company’s overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Zebra Technologies’ bearish outlook for the fourth quarter due to softening demand, continued supply-chain challenges and currency headwinds raise concerns. The company expects adjusted net sales to either decrease up to 2% or increase up to 1% for the ongoing quarter.Due to these headwinds, shares of Zebra Technologies have lost 14.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 12.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe negativity surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 earnings being revised downward by 5.1% and 13.1% in the past 60 days, respectively.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Campbell Soup Co. CPB, MGP Ingredients Inc. MGPI, The Hershey Co. HSY and e.l.f. Beauty Inc. ELF.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Consumer Staples Picks YTD with Room to Grow in DecemberU.S. stock markets witnessed severe volatility once again last week. Wall Street had seen an impressive rally from mid-October. A less-than-expected inflation rate in October, courtesy of several measures along with a dovish comment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in November, boosted investors’ confidence in risky assets like equities.However, hotter-than-expected job additions and a higher wage rate in November once again terminated the rally prematurely from what we saw from mid-June to mid-August. A tight labor market is being perceived as a pushback from the Fed’s recent stance of trying to reassure the markets that it would slacken its stringent policy measures to avoid a hard-landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like consumer staples to stabilize your portfolio. We have selected five consumer staple stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These stocks have appreciated more than 20% with room for more upside in December. These companies are — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Campbell Soup Co., MGP Ingredients Inc., The Hershey Co. and e.l.f. Beauty Inc.Consumer Staples Immune to the Vagaries of Economic CycleMarket participants are now unsure whether the Fed will reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike in the December FOMC meeting, as indicated by Powell, or will hike the rate by 75 basis points for the fifth time in a row.Story continuesInvestors are not sure whether the terminal interest for this round of monetary tightening will stay within the 5% threshold or go beyond that. A section of economists and financial experts are still concerned that a higher interest rate will lead to a recession in 2023.The consumer staples sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products for daily use. This makes the sector defensive in nature.Therefore, this has always been a go-to place for investors, who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations irrespective of internal or external disturbances. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows. Consequently, adding stocks from the consumer staples basket lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market.Out of the 11 broad sectors of the market’s benchmark — the S&amp;P 500 Index — the energy sector is solely trading in positive territory with a huge rally of 49% year to date. However, among the remaining 10 sectors, consumer staples has suffered marginally by 0.5% year to date while the benchmark has itself tumbled 16.3%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with strong growth potential for December.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2022. This year’s inflation and continued interest rates hike were heavy on the markets. Analysts recommended investing in income-generating stocks because they could stabilize overall portfolios through dividends. Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far.

With over 10.6 million shares, GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.GoodHaven Capital Management mentioned Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”9.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”6.

97,7f215695-0d90-324a-96d0-1aa14f711dc1,ADM,2022-12-14,Top 5 Consumer Staples Picks YTD With Room to Grow in December,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-consumer-staples-picks-131801499.html,1670937481,STORY,['ADM'],"[U.S. stock markets witnessed severe volatility once again last week. Wall Street had seen an impressive rally from mid-October. A less-than-expected inflation rate in October, courtesy of several measures along with a dovish comment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in November, boosted investors’ confidence in risky assets like equities.However, hotter-than-expected job additions and a higher wage rate in November once again terminated the rally prematurely what we saw from mid-June to mid-August. A tight labor market is being perceived as a pushback from the Fed’s recent stance of trying to reassure the markets that it would slacken its stringent policy measures to avoid a hard-landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like consumer staples to stabilize your portfolio. We have selected five consumer staple stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These stocks have appreciated more than 20% with room for more upside in December. These companies are — Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Campbell Soup Co. CPB, MGP Ingredients Inc. MGPI, The Hershey Co. HSY and e.l.f. Beauty Inc. ELF.Consumer Staples Immune to the Vagaries of Economic CycleMarket participants are now unsure whether the Fed will reduce the magnitude of the interest rate hike in the December FOMC meeting, as indicated by Powell, or will hike the rate by 75 basis points for the fifth time in a row.Investors are not sure whether the terminal interest for this round of monetary tightening will stay within the 5% threshold or go beyond that. A section of economists and financial experts are still concerned that a higher interest rate will lead to a recession in 2023.The consumer staples sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products for daily use. This makes the sector defensive in nature.Story continuesTherefore, this has always been a go-to place for investors, who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations irrespective of internal or external disturbances. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows. Consequently, adding stocks from the consumer staples basket lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market.Out of the 11 broad sectors of the market’s benchmark — the S&amp;P 500 Index — the energy sector is solely trading in positive territory with a huge rally of 49% year to date. However, among the remaining 10 sectors, consumer staples has suffered marginally by 0.5% year to date while the benchmark has itself tumbled 16.3%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with strong growth potential for December. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions for this year in the past 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the performance of the S&amp;P 500 so far this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks That Don't Pay Dividends.The Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) is a stock market index that tracks the stock performance of pretty much the 500 largest companies listed on the major stock exchanges in the US. The index was subject to poorer performance over the last 12 months in light of various problems such as the geopolitical issues caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflationary and recession concerns due to the Fed's aggressive rate hike stance, and the bursting of the tech bubble. However, stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 saw broader gains in November and some market strategists are optimistic about December as well. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was also quoted as saying that the central bank will now slow its rate-hiking campaign, easing pressures on the market.A few of the most famous names on the S&amp;P 500 include companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). These being in the tech sector have consistently been among the best-performing sector on the index over the last decade. Such stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 rise by about 5.4% at the close of November. The broader benchmark index ended up outperforming the smaller Nasdaq Composite index, which gained only 4.4% over the same period.While many major companies on the index are also strong dividend payers, it is not a requisite condition for a company to be a dividend-payer for it to be an attractive investment choice. Many companies may choose to reinvest their proceeds from ongoing operations into their business models to retain their strong financial performance instead of paying out the same money to their shareholders. This opens larger avenues for a company's individual growth in the long run.Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks that don't pay dividends, to recommend attractive stock picks for investors looking to invest in solid companies with long-term growth potential.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the performance of the S&amp;P 500 so far this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks That Don't Pay Dividends.The Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) is a stock market index that tracks the stock performance of pretty much the 500 largest companies listed on the major stock exchanges in the US. The index was subject to poorer performance over the last 12 months in light of various problems such as the geopolitical issues caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflationary and recession concerns due to the Fed's aggressive rate hike stance, and the bursting of the tech bubble. However, stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 saw broader gains in November and some market strategists are optimistic about December as well. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was also quoted as saying that the central bank will now slow its rate-hiking campaign, easing pressures on the market.A few of the most famous names on the S&amp;P 500 include companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). These being in the tech sector have consistently been among the best-performing sector on the index over the last decade. Such stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 rise by about 5.4% at the close of November. The broader benchmark index ended up outperforming the smaller Nasdaq Composite index, which gained only 4.4% over the same period.While many major companies on the index are also strong dividend payers, it is not a requisite condition for a company to be a dividend-payer for it to be an attractive investment choice. Many companies may choose to reinvest their proceeds from ongoing operations into their business models to retain their strong financial performance instead of paying out the same money to their shareholders. This opens larger avenues for a company's individual growth in the long run.Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks that don't pay dividends, to recommend attractive stock picks for investors looking to invest in solid companies with long-term growth potential.

Shares fell another 1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, and the company's ticker page remains among the most visited on Yahoo Finance.""The decline is likely in response to the CPI [Consumer Price Index] report that showed U.S. air fares fell 3% from October to November,"" CFRA analyst Colin Scarola wrote in a note moments after the latest CPI reading. ""However, the CPI air fare data has not historically been representative of UAL's pricing trends. For example, the CPI data showed U.S. air fares fell 8% from Q2 to Q3, but UAL's actual pricing was down just 1% Q/Q in Q3. Further, some moderation in air fares is to be expected given how much fuel prices have fallen recently, allowing airlines to charge less while increasing profitability. Notably, UAL forecasts a $3.61 average fuel price for Q4, but as of today, jet fuel prices are under $2.70 (-25% vs. forecast).""Rival airlines such as Delta, Jetblue, and Southwest also saw large losses on Tuesday.Scarola added that the sell-off was overdone and reiterated a Buy rating on United's stock.

(NYSE:PM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$102. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Philip Morris International insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$251m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Philip Morris International Insiders?The fact that there have been no Philip Morris International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Philip Morris International, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

PMI intentionally structured the new ambitions to maximize their impact around a 10-year span, from 2023 to 2033.Detailing its strategy to Tackle Climate Change, PMI’s 2021 Low-Carbon Transition Plan brought forward the company’s ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality in its direct operations (scopes 1+2) by 2025, and to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire value chain (scopes 1+2+3) by 2040. In addition, it introduced a new goal for the company’s critical suppliers to adopt science-based targets (SBTs) by 2025, in line with the SBTs to which PMI has already committed.To Preserve Nature, the company published its 2020 Zero Deforestation Manifesto, achieved zero gross deforestation of primary and protected forests, and is working towards achieving zero net deforestation of managed natural forests and having a net positive impact on forests associated with the tobacco supply chain by 2025. In its paper and pulp-based materials supply chain, the company targets zero gross deforestation of primary and protected forests by 2025, as well as zero net deforestation of managed natural forests and no conversion of natural ecosystems by 2030.Perfect Forest™PMI is pleased to be at the forefront of promoting the sustainable management of forests and is encouraged that respected stakeholders recognize the importance of what the company is doing. Perfect Forest™ is the name of PMI’s operating nature-based solutions (NbS) projects to preserve forest resources. PMI believes that a constant effort at the landscape level is key in transforming the relationship the company has with forest ecosystems and local stakeholders, where ""perfection"" is the mutual contribution between the protection of nature and the resulting ecosystem services generated by it. In particular, Perfect Forest™ generates carbon sequestration, enhancing the potential of forestry systems to deliver sustainable forest products and social benefits. It also creates the conditions for protecting water resources, balancing soil elements, and preserving natural habitats—key to supporting biodiversity.Story continuesPMI’s New Ambitions to Preserve NatureBiodiversityProtect nature by achieving no net loss on ecosystems connected to PMI’s value chain by 2033Contribute towards a net positive impact on nature by 2050Water stewardshipScale solutions towards a positive impact on water resources, measured as volume of water optimized and restored, by 2033Contribute towards a positive impact on water resources by 2050""As our new ambitions demonstrate, PMI understands that decarbonization, biodiversity protection, forestry management, and water stewardship are deeply connected. We aspire to lead by example in the responsible and sustainable management of natural resources that can allow the promotion and protection of natural ecosystems,"" said Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer. ""It is important to recognize the linkages between biodiversity loss and vulnerability to climate change, and how these could exacerbate poverty and inequality. Adaptation strategies that promote the protection, preservation, and efficient use of natural resources help us build preparedness to manage potential environmental impacts that could affect our business.""PMI’s strategies to Tackle Climate Change and Preserve Nature have been recognized by CDP, a not-for-profit charity that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. As of Dec. 13, 2022, PMI has been honored with the Triple A score for its efforts across climate, forests, and water stewardship. The ranking places PMI among one in 1,000 companies worldwide to achieve the prestigious Triple A score and among the world's most pioneering companies leading on environmental transparency and performance.""Natural capital is a wealth we all share and depend on. It is essential that we do our part to protect, sustainably manage, and nurture it—and we’re proud that CDP has once again recognized PMI’s efforts to do exactly that,"" explained Massimo Andolina, SVP, Operations. ""Further, preserving natural ecosystems by properly managing land and water resources helps increase the resilience of our production systems and reduce operational risks.""Through its Integrated Report and CDP submissions, PMI seeks to align with and is proud to support the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Also reflected in the company’s Triple A rating from CDP are PMI’s contributions to the development of the parallel Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). TNFD centers on the importance of protecting ecosystems and promoting biodiversity. It states that its mission is, in part, ""to develop and deliver a risk management and disclosure framework for organizations to report and act on evolving nature-related risks.""Visit pmi.com/sustainability for more information and read PMI’s dedicated disclosure focused on Preserve Nature, published today. To learn more about PMI’s overall approach to sustainability, please refer to its latest Integrated Report 2021.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that an exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of September 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI's smoke-free products are available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021, PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

(NYSE: HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced its enterprise-wide adopted Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) program, a patient-centered, research-based, multidisciplinary approach to surgical recovery. The ESR program has been adopted by 167 HCA Healthcare facilities and has demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery, including a two-day average reduction in length of hospital stays and an up to 44% decrease in opioid usage for some surgeries.""After studying more than 20 years of clinical research and peer-reviewed publications in addition to our own internal data, we discovered that a facility making a few key changes, such as using multimodal approaches to managing pain and encouraging patients to eat and walk around within 24 hours after surgery, can have a significant impact on a patient’s recovery,"" said Dr. Randy Fagin, Chief Medical Officer of HCA Healthcare’s National Group. ""From the physician’s office prior to surgery to follow-up care, a facility’s ESR program allows patients to play an active role in managing their own care and recovery plan.""ESR uses select pre-, intra- and post-operative interventions designed to improve outcomes and the patient experience. The program was derived from Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS), a recovery program that has been standard practice in Europe for a number of years and consists of up to 21 components. HCA Healthcare’s ESR focuses on the six tactics believed to have the greatest impact on patient outcomes:Goal-directed fluid therapy: active monitoring of a patient’s fluid balance to achieve an optimal hydration level throughout surgery.Patient education: equipping patients with a personal recovery checklist so they can play an active role in their care.Multimodal pain management: an individualized approach only using opioids on an as-needed basis and instead using non-opioid pain relievers and other pain management techniques.Permissive pre-op hydration/carb loading: drinking fluids and a carbohydrate-rich drink before surgery to improve hydration and insulin resistance as well as to curb nausea.DREAM = drink, eating and mobilization within 24 hours post-op: encouraging patients to drink, eat and move shortly after their surgery.Multidisciplinary team: creating a group of team members, including a surgeon champion, an anesthesia champion, nursing and pharmacy, who work together to guide the facility’s program and each patient’s care journey.Story continuesJared Stockett, a double knee replacement patient at HCA Healthcare’s West Valley Medical Center, is one of more than two million patients who have participated in the ESR program adopted by facilities throughout HCA Healthcare. ""The surgeries went really well. Each time I went in at 8 a.m., the surgery started around 10 a.m. and I went home around 3 p.m. that afternoon. By the time I left the hospital, I had already been up and walking with a walker,"" said Stockett. ""Three days after each surgery, my knee already felt better. By following the instructions from my care team, recovery went very smoothly.""As a learning health system, HCA Healthcare uses data from approximately 35 million annual patient encounters to share best practices and focus on continuously improving care. Based on data collected from 141,482 joint replacement, gynecologic oncology, colorectal and bariatric surgeries in 2021, the ESR protocol has shown to be a proven roadmap to help improve surgical results, including:A 2.1-day reduction in length of stay;A 54% decrease in 30-day readmissions for joint replacements;A 45% decrease in 90-day readmissions for gynecological surgery;Up to a 44% decrease in opioid usage; and2.4 million fewer morphine medications dispensed.Based on these outcomes delivered to patients, HCA Healthcare invested an additional $20 million in monitoring equipment to support expanding the program to other surgical service lines in 2021.About HCA HealthcareNashville-based HCA Healthcare is one of the nation’s leading providers of healthcare services comprising 182 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.

To skip our detailed analysis of the nanotechnology sector in 2022 and the future of nanotech, go directly and see 5 Best Nanotechnology Stocks to Buy Now.Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a close-to atomic scale to develop new structures, materials, and devices. Developed in the late 1980s, nanotechnology has since transformed numerous industries like medicine, consumer products, energy, materials and manufacturing. The concept is best explained by Chad Mirkin, a Northwestern University's professor of chemistry and materials science:“Everything, when miniaturized to the sub-100-nanometer scale, has new properties, regardless of what it is. This is what makes nanoparticles the materials of the future. They have strange chemical and physical properties compared to their larger-particle kin. The thing that matters about nanoparticles is their scale. The smaller you go, the ratio of surface to bulk atoms goes up. At a larger scale, the atoms at the surface are relatively inconsequential. But at nanoscales, you could have a particle that is almost all surface. Those atoms begin to contribute very significantly to the overall properties of the material.”Photo by L N on UnsplashGlobal Nanotechnology Industry: An OutlookAmid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for nanotechnology was estimated to be around $54.2 billion in 2020. Since then, the figure has been revised to project an overall expected market worth of $126.8 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% over the analysis period 2020-2027. The market is highly diversified into multiple segments, one of them being Nano Materials. The Nano Materials segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13% to reach $107.4 billion by the end of the aforementioned analysis period. The segment currently accounts for a little more than 15% of the global nanotechnology market.According to recent reports, the countries dominating the global nanotechnology sector in 2022 are China, the United States, India, Iran, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. The United States accounts for more than 29.5% of the global market size while China accounts for 29.53%, making the latter the largest nanotechnology contributor in the world. China is expected to reach an estimated market size of $22.1 billion at the end of the analysis period. Among noteworthy geographic markets which are rapidly becoming players on the global stage are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at more than 11%, respectively, over the 2020-2027.

Like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) is one of the best nanotechnology stocks to buy now.On November 15, Benchmark analyst Mark Miller lowered the price target on VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) to $25 from $35, keeping a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, while there was significant upside in the company's Q3 2022 earnings when compared to Q2 2022, the tenuous macroeconomic climate is likely to catch up with the stock. However, the company sees strong demand in areas like advanced packaging and MOCVD, which the stock is well-leveraged to capitalize upon. In light of this, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) remains significantly undervalued on the assumption of long-term revenue growth of more than 9%.9. PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG)Hedge Fund Holdings: 34Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is an American company and global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials. The company is actively involved in nanotechnology, from Research and Development to the sale of multiple products which contain nanoparticles. In Q3 2022, PPG Industries Inc.

(NYSE:PPG) to $128 from $130, keeping a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst was impressed by exceptional Q3 2022 returns and reiterated the moat-worthy stock has a history of demonstrating exceptional pricing power. It has an impressive track record of delivering shareholder returns via share buybacks and dividend growth, recently declaring a $0.62 dividend in October. Due to this, the analyst reckons the stock is drastically mispriced with respect to its strong fundamentals and favorable potential.Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG) in their Q1 2022 investor letter:“While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8. IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM)Hedge Fund Holdings: 40Based in Armonk, New York, IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology corporation which specializes in the production and sale of hardware, middleware and software.

The company's blockchain segment is well-leveraged to carry the company through macroeconomic headwinds, and a volatile foreign exchange situation. And although IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Q3 2022 returns were not exceptional, growth catalysts like IFS and hybrid cloud will aid the company in restoring a positive growth trend.7. DuPont de Nemours Inc.

(NYSE:DD) to $81 from $76, keeping a Buy rating on the shares.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Halliburton HAL, Schlumberger SLB, Nine Energy Service NINE and Select Energy Services WTTR.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Top-Ranked Oil Services Stocks for Your PortfolioThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry appears on track to achieve substantial gains as energy investment ticks up and demand for products and services to drill hydrocarbons continues to move higher. Building on this bullish narrative, firms like Halliburton, Schlumberger, Nine Energy Service and Select Energy Services have room for upside and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Strong Industry ResurgenceOilfield services companies were one of the hardest hit during the pandemic as top energy companies resorted to spending cuts (particularly on the costly upstream projects) owing to plunging profit margins. This, in turn, meant cancellation or contract renegotiation for equipment suppliers. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in exploration and production (E&amp;P) capital expenditure led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds.Apart from accelerating money flows into the Oil/Energy space, increased efficiencies and cost-reducing technological advances have renewed interest in the oilfield service space, raising hopes for the industry’s recovery. As the industry becomes less fragmented through a spate of mergers and acquisitions, commodity prices remain robust and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend. The lower competitive intensity also gives the sector components freedom to implement price increases. A combination of higher volume and pricing is expected to improve energy service companies’ margins.Story continuesThe oilfield service companies are also well positioned to benefit from other favorable industry trends, including a rebound in the highly lucrative international markets, a pick up in offshore activities and increasing complexity of the projects that require more technology. On top of this, OPEC’s conservative production policy, sanctions on Russian oil and limited availability of spare supply capacity are likely to further strengthen the industry dynamics.All this adds up to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services group currently carrying a Zacks Industry Rank #22 — placing it in the top 9% of around 250 Zacks industries. The group’s excellent position indicates fairly strong near-term prospects for its constituent companies.4 Oilfield Service Stocks to Benefit From a Positive Macro EnvironmentWith crude demand set to remain robust and eventually surpass the pre-COVID record, most of the domestic oilfield service capacity is on the verge of being exhausted. In this context, we see a strong order book for providers of equipment and services that help E&amp;P companies find and extract fossil fuels.To guide investors to the right picks, we have highlighted four oilfield service companies that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance.

This enables NTAM to recommend adjustments needed and is consistent with NTAM’s core philosophy: investors should get paid for the risks they take—in all market environments and in any investment strategy.Active risk is necessary to generate excess returns, but not all risks are created equally. Some have been historically proven to generate excess returns over long periods (compensated risks) and some have not (uncompensated risks).""In the current market environment, when investors are struggling with underperformance, outcomes that differ from intended results often cause confusion about how various—and often hidden—risks are impacting their portfolios,"" said Michael Hunstad, Chief Investment Officer for Global Equities at Northern Trust Asset Management. ""The number one question that institutions have when their portfolios don’t deliver expected outcomes is ‘why?’ By aggregating years of analysis in 'The Risk Report,' we are able to shed light on the causes.""The 2022 edition, like its 2020 predecessor, surfaces six key drivers of unexpected portfolio results. Those include portfolio exposure to uncompensated risks and the performance-hindering ""cancellation effect,"" which occurs when, in attempting to target specific risks and outcomes, different asset managers unwittingly select investments that ""cancel"" each other out, thereby diluting risk compensation.Story continuesDespite a vastly different market environment from 2020, the fact that portfolio issues cited in the 2020 analysis remained the same in the 2022 analysis underscores the importance of several key issues, including:Institutions had nearly two times more uncompensated vs. compensated riskPortfolios had become overcrowded with uncompensated risks that tended to dilute the potential for excess returns, suggesting investors are not getting paid for the risks they take.Underlying portfolio holdings canceled each other out – and hurt performanceInvestment styles — such as growth and value — can at times work against each other, and underlying managers in a portfolio can take competing positions on various factors to create systematic risk cancellation. Managers within a portfolio can also compete on their weightings in single securities, subsequently creating active share cancellation.Unintended outcomes were the result of hidden portfolio riskStyle tilts contributed 33% to active risk on average in the 2022 report — up from 29% in the 2020 report — but these ""bets"" commonly introduce unintended risks as a side effect. An investor might, for example, allocate to energy securities for value exposure without being aware of their underlying commodity risks, or might be overweight real estate to escape equities volatility and find themselves exposed to the corresponding interest rate risk instead.Other key drivers of unexpected results include:Impact of Style Investing: 50% of portfolios (on average) showed signs of utilizing growth, value or other conventional style investing, which often creates a mix of managers. Together, their performance closely mimicked corresponding indexes, despite having fees typical of active management.Over-Diversification: Traditionally, institutional portfolios have multiple asset managers, but this often leads to diluted performance as the result of conflicting strategies and approaches that offset returns.Timing Manager Changes: Investor attempts to ""time"" outperformance by changing managers are often ineffective, while also increasing costs.""The Risk Report"" arrives as part of NTAM’s ""Risk Insights Series.""

Yet, supply-chain hurdles, chip shortage issues and severe FX impact deter growth. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 1.8% compared with the industry’s 24.4% decline.Hologic delivered better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Both the company’s molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses grew strong in the quarter.Hologic’s global molecular diagnostics franchise grew 17% at CER, excluding revenues from COVID tests. This upside reflected the high utilization of the company’s expanded Panther installed base. The uptick in the molecular diagnostics business was broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in the portfolio.Hologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. price | Hologic, Inc. QuoteThe legacy STI business contributed growth in dollars while the newer assays, including the vaginitis panel, Amgen and the company’s virology portfolio lifted the growth rate. As for Panther placements, at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company had nearly 3,250 Panthers placed globally. This favorably compares to the pre-COVID level as the company exited fiscal 2019 with about 1,700 Panthers in the field.Revenues at the GYN Surgical business rose 9% year over year organically and over 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the COVID pressure on surgical business abated in the quarter, and the company registered procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from its new business lines. The major growth drivers of fiscal Q4 were MyoSure Fluent as well as Bolder and Acessa.Hologic currently expects the Surgical arm to deliver low double-digit growth in fiscal 2023. Similar to the last two quarters of fiscal 2022, the company believes MyoSure and Fluent along with Acessa and Bolder to continue to act as major contributors.Story continuesOn the flip side, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hologic witnessed a decline in reported revenues compared to the year-ago fiscal period. The decline in the top line can be attributed to lower COVID assay sales and supply-chain challenges in the Breast Health business. Revenues in the Breast Health segment fell on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent shortage of semiconductor chips.Escalating operating costs and the contraction of both margins are worrying. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 690 basis points (bps) to 62.5%.According to the company, the decrease in the gross margin was primarily due to a year-over-year decline in COVID assay sales and lower capital equipment sales due to supply-chain challenges related to semiconductor chip shortages, which impacted its Breast Health business. The company’s adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, down 1460 bps.We also remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic faces owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the company’s overall performance in the past few quarters.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV, Orthofix Medical Inc. OFIX and Merit Medical System MMSI.ShockWave Medical, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 33.1% for 2023.

This is a huge milestone for Verizon and the industry as a whole, and we’re incredibly proud to continue to be trailblazers in the new era of content and subscription services.”Story continuesOnce subscribed to a service through +play, Verizon customers can access and use the service directly through the providers’ app or online portal while managing the subscriptions through +play. In addition, +play will send notifications to customers to alert them when free trial periods ending and if there are price changes.Pictured above: Jenna Ortega in Netflix’s “Wednesday”Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"

The company measures its Most Popular list based on each title’s viewership in its first 28 days of availability; “Dahmer” reached 856.2 million hours in that time, while “Wednesday” still has one more week to climb even higher. However, the series is now 352.1 million hours behind “Stranger Things” Season 4’s performance in its first 28 days, and with “Wednesday” racking up 269.7 million hours viewed during the Dec. 5-11 viewing window, it seems most likely that “Stranger Things” will hold onto its No. 1 title among English-language TV shows.But it’s also important to consider that “Stranger Things” has a longer runtime — Season 4 runs for approximately 13 hours while “Wednesday” runs for 6.8 hours, giving the former a significant advantage when comparing viewing hours alone. Interestingly, Netflix estimates that a whopping 150 million households have viewed “Wednesday” (dividing 1.02 billion viewing hours by the 6.8-hour runtime). That’s already further along than “Stranger Things 4” was during its first 28 days, which comes out to an estimate of 104 million when dividing its 1.352 billion viewing hours by its 13-hour runtime.“Harry &amp; Meghan” took the No. 2 spot on Netflix’s weekly rankings with 81.6 million hours viewed in its first four days of availability — making it the streamer’s biggest documentary debut ever. An estimated 28 million households have tuned into the first three episodes — the only ones available, as the final three debut on Thursday. It’s presumable that the series will remain near the top of the chart for weeks to come. The second-highest view hours for a Netflix documentary premiere week (based on four days of viewing, which is what the “Harry &amp; Meghan” number is based on) is essentially a tie between “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez” and “Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,” but those titles premiered before Netflix introduced its Top 10 lists based on hours viewed.Story continuesComing in third on Netflix’s English-language TV shows for the week was the first part of the second and final season of “Firefly Lane,” the drama based on the novel of the same name, which had 50.35 million hours viewed Dec. 5-11. Fans also revisited Season 1, which entered the list at No. 5 with 20.94 million hours viewed. Popular thriller “1899” delivered 27.53 million hours viewed for the period, while “The Crown” Season 5 held its standing with 18.9 million hours viewed.Meanwhile, “Too Hot to Handle” returned to the list, with Season 4 garnering 20.43 million hours viewed for the week. Rounding out the Top 10 English-language TV series were reality cooking show “Snack vs. Chef,” hosted by Megan Stalter and Hari Kondabolu (No. 8), followed by “Dead to Me” Season 4 (No. 9) and Season 4 of “Manifest” (No. 10).See Netflix’s Top 10 lists for the week of Dec. 5-11 below, beginning with English-language series and followed by non-English-language TV shows, English-language movies and then non-English-language movies.Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.The ratings reflect Spirit’s and Radius’ balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as each company’s adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.Spirit and Radius each have inherent benefits of financial flexibility and support as captive insurers for their ultimate parent, Phillips 66 [NYSE: PSX], with integrated operations, closely aligned and uniform interests and establishment as core elements in its overall risk management program. The captives’ loss experience has remained generally favorable due to the parent’s strong loss control program and to a relatively small number of material catastrophe losses. Phillips 66 conducts periodic reviews of Spirit’s and Radius’ potential loss exposures through an industrial risks specialist.The captives’ underwriting risks largely consist of onshore and limited offshore property and liability business. Spirit provides property damage, business interruption, construction all risks, excess liability and employee medical reimbursement insurance to Phillips 66, its affiliates and subsidiaries’ domestic U.S. operations only; however, Spirit generally does not provide coverage for Texas-based risks. Radius provides similar coverage (i.e., property damage, business interruption, excess liability) to Phillips 66, its affiliate and subsidiaries’ non-U.S. risks in which Phillips 66 has ownership interests.Spirit and Radius have exposure to low frequency, high severity loss claims due to the sizable limits offered on their respective policies, introducing potential significant dependence on reinsurance protection. Spirit also provides terrorism coverage to its parent. Though relatively high on a gross basis, terrorism exposure is heavily mitigated by reinsurance protection afforded by federal TRIPRA (Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act) coverage, which expires in 2027.Story continuesAM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2022. This year’s inflation and continued interest rates hike were heavy on the markets. Analysts recommended investing in income-generating stocks because they could stabilize overall portfolios through dividends. Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far. These companies also have strong balance sheets and sound financials. The stocks are ranked according to their year-to-date returns, as of December 12.Story continues16.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

Its exposure to natural gas helped the stock perform more in line with natural gas E&amp;Ps, which led the sector due to the European energy crisis and U.S. shale gas being considered a secure long-term source of liquid natural gas. In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”9.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”6.

This is the first study to demonstrate superior overall survival (OS) with BLINCYTO added to consolidation chemotherapy over current standard of care (multiagent consolidation chemotherapy) in newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL who were measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative following induction and intensification chemotherapy. These results were featured in a press briefing on Monday, Dec. 12 at 8:30 a.m. CT and presented on Tuesday, Dec. 13 at 9 a.m. CT as a late breaking oral presentation (LBA1) at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition in New Orleans.Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8812856-amgen-blincyto-blinatumomab-added-to-consolidation-chemotherapy-significantly-improves-survival/""Treatment with BLINCYTO in addition to consolidation chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 58% compared to chemotherapy alone. We are pleased by this remarkable improvement in overall survival, and we look forward to sharing these data with regulatory authorities as soon as possible,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Amgen continues to advance a robust development program for BLINCYTO, with a focus on minimizing chemotherapy and a subcutaneous formulation to help address remaining unmet needs for patients with B-ALL.""The Phase 3 randomized trial (E1910), activated in December 2013, evaluated the safety and efficacy of BLINCYTO added to standard of care consolidation chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL with no MRD after induction and intensification chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was OS and key secondary endpoints included relapse-free survival, MRD status, and incidence of adverse events. Based on a recommendation by the ECOG-ACRIN Data Safety Monitoring Committee and consistent with the pre-defined efficacy threshold, results from the planned interim analysis are now reported due to overwhelming efficacy reported in the BLINCYTO arm.Story continuesWith a median follow up of 43 months, the study met its primary endpoint with a significant improvement in overall survival favoring the BLINCYTO arm; median OS was not reached vs. 71.4 months in the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24 - 0.75; two-sided p=0.003). After about 3.5 years of follow-up, 83% of the patients who went on to receive additional standard consolidation chemotherapy plus experimental BLINCYTO were alive versus 65% of those who received chemotherapy only. No new safety signals were reported for the combination.""Adults with newly diagnosed ALL can achieve a high rate of complete remission with chemotherapy, but frequently relapse and have disappointing survival rates.1,2 Historically, outcomes for newly diagnosed adults with ALL have been significantly worse than for children, where up to 90% of patients are cured with frontline therapy.3,4 In this study, survival rates for adults when blinatumomab was added to chemotherapy are significantly improved in patients with MRD-negative remission, approaching those we have seen in children,"" said Selina M. Luger, M.D., professor of hematology-oncology at the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center and Perelman School of Medicine, chair of the ECOG-ACRIN Leukemia Committee and an investigator on the study. ""Moreover, the data provide additional clinical evidence supporting the recent guideline updates for adult ALL recommending blinatumomab as consolidation in both MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients.""Data from the trial will be submitted to global regulatory authorities, including where BLINCYTO has been previously approved.Study E1910 was designed and conducted independently from industry with public funding. The ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group sponsored the trial with funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. Other NCI-funded network groups took part in the study. In addition, Amgen provided BLINCYTO and support through an NCI Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).E1910 Study DesignIn the E1910 Phase 3 randomized trial, 488 patients aged 30-70 with newly diagnosed B-ALL were enrolled. All participants initially received 2.5 months of combination induction chemotherapy (step 1). After remission induction (step 1), if patients were in complete remission, they continued on-study and received an intensification course of high dose chemotherapy (step 2). Subsequently, their remission and MRD status were determined. All patients were then randomized/assigned to receive four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with or without four 28-day cycles of BLINCYTO (step 3). Following FDA approval of blinatumomab for MRD-positive patients in March 2018, MRD-positive participants were assigned to the blinatumomab arm. MRD-negative patients continued to be randomized. After completion of consolidation chemo +/- BLINCYTO, patients were given 2.5 years of chemotherapy maintenance therapy timed from the start of the intensification cycle (step 4).For more information, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov.About BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab)BLINCYTO is a BiTE® (bispecific T-cell engager) immuno-oncology therapy that targets CD19 surface antigens on B cells. BiTE molecules fight cancer by helping the body's immune system detect and target malignant cells by engaging T cells (a type of white blood cell capable of killing other cells perceived as threats) to cancer cells. By bringing T cells near cancer cells, the T cells can inject toxins and trigger cancer cell death (apoptosis). BiTE immuno-oncology therapies are currently being investigated for their potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.BLINCYTO was granted breakthrough therapy and priority review designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of:relapsed or refractory CD-19 positive B-cell precursor ALL in adults and children.CD-19 positive B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and children. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.In the European Union (EU), BLINCYTO is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of:adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.pediatric patients aged 1 year or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME and NEUROLOGICAL TOXICITIESCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO®. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® and treat with corticosteroids as recommended.Neurological toxicities, which may be severe, life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO®. Interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as recommended.ContraindicationsBLINCYTO® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to blinatumomab or to any component of the product formulation.Warnings and PrecautionsCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in 15% of patients with R/R ALL and in 7% of patients with MRD-positive ALL. The median time to onset of CRS is 2 days after the start of infusion and the median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days among cases that resolved. Closely monitor and advise patients to contact their healthcare professional for signs and symptoms of serious adverse events such as fever, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased total bilirubin (TBILI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The manifestations of CRS after treatment with BLINCYTO® overlap with those of infusion reactions, capillary leak syndrome, and hemophagocytic histiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. If severe CRS occurs, interrupt BLINCYTO® until CRS resolves. Discontinue BLINCYTO® permanently if life-threatening CRS occurs. Administer corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS.Neurological Toxicities: Approximately 65% of patients receiving BLINCYTO® in clinical trials experienced neurological toxicities. The median time to the first event was within the first 2 weeks of BLINCYTO® treatment and the majority of events resolved. The most common (≥ 10%) manifestations of neurological toxicity were headache and tremor. Severe, life–threatening, or fatal neurological toxicities occurred in approximately 13% of patients, including encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Manifestations of neurological toxicity included cranial nerve disorders. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as outlined in the PI.Infections: Approximately 25% of patients receiving BLINCYTO® in clinical trials experienced serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. Administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing as appropriate during treatment. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of infection and treat appropriately, including interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO® as needed.Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed. Preventive measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used during BLINCYTO® treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of TLS and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® as needed to manage these events.Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed. Monitor appropriate laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO® infusion and interrupt BLINCYTO® if prolonged neutropenia occurs.Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Due to the possibility of neurological events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO® are at risk for loss of consciousness, and should be advised against driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO® is being administered.Elevated Liver Enzymes: Transient elevations in liver enzymes have been associated with BLINCYTO® treatment with a median time to onset of 3 days. In patients receiving BLINCYTO®, although the majority of these events were observed in the setting of CRS, some cases of elevated liver enzymes were observed outside the setting of CRS, with a median time to onset of 19 days. Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients. Monitor ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and TBILI prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO® treatment. BLINCYTO® treatment should be interrupted if transaminases rise to &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if TBILI rises to &gt; 3 times ULN.Pancreatitis: Fatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO® in combination with dexamethasone in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting. Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO® and dexamethasone as needed.Leukoencephalopathy: Although the clinical significance is unknown, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO®, especially in patients previously treated with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy.Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO® treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration in the PI strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).Immunization: Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of BLINCYTO® treatment, during treatment, and until immune recovery following last cycle of BLINCYTO®.Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative: Serious and fatal adverse reactions including ""gasping syndrome,"" which is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations, can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs including BLINCYTO® (with preservative). When prescribing BLINCYTO® (with preservative) for pediatric patients, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including BLINCYTO® (with preservative) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. Due to the addition of bacteriostatic saline, 7-day bags of BLINCYTO® solution for infusion with preservative contain benzyl alcohol and are not recommended for use in any patients weighing &lt; 22 kg.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL (BLAST Study) treated with BLINCYTO® were pyrexia (91%), infusion-related reactions (77%), headache (39%), infections (pathogen unspecified 39%), tremor (31%), and chills (28%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 61% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) included pyrexia, tremor, encephalopathy, aphasia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, overdose, device related infection, seizure, and staphylococcal infection.The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in clinical trial experience of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL (TOWER Study) treated with BLINCYTO® were infections (bacterial and pathogen unspecified), pyrexia, headache, infusion-related reactions, anemia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 62% of patients. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) included febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, sepsis, pneumonia, overdose, septic shock, CRS, bacterial sepsis, device related infection, and bacteremia.Adverse reactions that were observed more frequently (≥ 10%) in the pediatric population compared to the adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL were pyrexia (80% vs. 61%), hypertension (26% vs. 8%), anemia (41% vs. 24%), infusion-related reaction (49% vs. 34%), thrombocytopenia (34% vs. 21%), leukopenia (24% vs. 11%), and weight increased (17% vs. 6%).In pediatric patients less than 2 years old (infants), the incidence of neurologic toxicities was not significantly different than for the other age groups, but its manifestations were different; the only event terms reported were agitation, headache, insomnia, somnolence, and irritability. Infants also had an increased incidence of hypokalemia (50%) compared to other pediatric age cohorts (15-20%) or adults (17%).Dosage and Administration GuidelinesBLINCYTO® is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a constant flow rate using an infusion pump which should be programmable, lockable, non-elastomeric, and have an alarm.It is very important that the instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration provided in the full Prescribing Information are strictly followed to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose).Please see full Prescribing Information and medication guide for BLINCYTO at www.BLINCYTO.com.About BiTE® TechnologyBiTE® (bispecific T cell engager) technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform that is designed to engage patient's own T cells to any tumor-specific antigen, activating the cytotoxic potential of T cells to eliminate detectable cancer.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

This will be the biggest deal this year by a major pharmaceutical company seeking new revenue sources to offset patent expiries. The agreement comes at a time when Horizon is facing the loss of patent protection on several blockbuster drugs.Following the news, shares of HZNP jumped 15.5%. The stock crushed its average volume as 44.4 million shares moved hands compared with just 3 million, on average. Meanwhile, shares of AMGN shed 0.7%. This put the spotlight on pharma ETFs, which could be the best way for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the proposed deal (read: Pharma ETFs in Focus Post Q3 Earnings).Investors should keep a close eye on the movement of these ETFs - VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, SPDR S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals ETF XPH and First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH - over the coming weeks.Deal in FocusPer the terms of the deal, Amgen will pay $116.50 in cash for each Horizon share, representing a premium of about 20% to the stock's closing price on Dec 9. The deal offers Amgen another chance to build its portfolio of rare-disease treatments after it closed the nearly $3.7 billion acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which focuses on autoimmune disease drugs, in October.The acquisition of Horizon brings new rare-disease drugs to Amgen’s pipeline with billions of dollars in sales that could offset revenue decline from patent expiries on its big-selling osteoporosis drugs Prolia and Xgeva later this decade. The pair of drugs accounted for nearly $5.3 billion of Amgen’s $26 billion revenues last year.With the deal, Amgen will gain two fast-growing drugs, the thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and the gout treatment Krystexxa. The new rare-disease drugs are projected to generate $3.6 billion in sales this year and $5.8 billion in 2027, according to analysts polled by FactSet.Amgen expects the regulatory approvals under the Irish business code to be achieved by the first half of 2023. Once completed, the deal will drive growth in Amgen's revenue and non-GAAP EPS and is expected to be accretive from 2024. Analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co expects acquiring Horizon could add about $4 billion in revenues for Amgen by 2024.Story continuesETFs in FocusLet’s delve into each ETF below:VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (PPH)VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF follows the MVIS US Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index and holds 25 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for less than 9% share each.

144,7fea7da2-19ba-3ffa-afee-a2173557c1cd,AMGN,2022-12-14,5 Dow Stocks That Helped the Index Minimize Loss in 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dow-stocks-helped-index-150603701.html,1670943963,STORY,"['CVX', '^DJI', 'IBM', 'AMGN', 'MRK', 'TRV']","[Rising inflation and fears of a recession have roiled the U.S. stock markets for most of 2022. The global economy has been rattled by the Ukraine war, lingering supply chain troubles and a sweeping energy crisis in Europe. Aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation have kept investors on tenterhooks.Year to date, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have dropped 28.8% and 16.3%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also down 6.4%.Identifying stocks to add to the investment portfolio in such a highly volatile market scenario can be quite challenging.Nevertheless, few Dow stocks have bucked the general trend and have seen price appreciation in the year. Investors might consider adding these stocks, which have proven resilient compared to the Dow Jones index.Dow Jones equity index consists of 30 of the country’s most prominent and valuable companies or blue-chip companies. Adding blue chip stocks to one’s portfolio amid a volatile market scenario is mostly considered as a safe investment bet.Blue chip stocks are usually less volatile to market vagaries. These companies generally have a large market cap, solid cash flows, a healthy balance sheet and, in most cases, a stable dividend policy.Therefore, we bring you the top five stocks — Chevron Corporation CVX, Merck &amp; Co MRK, Amgen AMGN, The Travelers Companies, Inc TRV and International Business Machines Corporation IBM — that have fared relatively better than the Dow Jones Index this year for investment consideration.5 Stocks that Minimized Dow Jones LossesChevron: Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world and is the only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares of Chevron have risen 44.7% year to date, outperforming Dow Jones and the Zacks sub-industry’s 43.7% gain during the same period.Chevron is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. The energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, owing to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, the San Ramon, CA-based company had $15.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $23.6 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization of a modest 12.9%.Chevron's earnings and cash flows have been steadily improving, boosted by higher crude realizations and a recovery in consumption. Earlier in the year, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by 6% to $1.42 per share (or $5.68 per share annualized) and promised anything between $5 billion and $15 billion worth of buybacks each year. Chevron recorded $37.1 billion in cash flow from operations during the nine months ended Sep 30, surging from $19.7 billion a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by $1.12 to $19.17 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 135.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck &amp; Co: Merck &amp; Co boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. Merck’s shares have risen 42.2% this year so far compared with 12% gain by the sub-industry.Keytruda has played an important role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years.

Behind its quiet facade lies a warren of workshops where modern machines melt metals and thump out money.""At the moment, every gold coin that comes off the coining press has already been sold,"" said Starsich. ""Right now we could sell three times as many as we are able to produce.""The Mint's shop, a modern corner of the building, has had a long queue outside daily for months. Among those standing in line was pensioner Renate, one of the few willing to talk about her purchasing habits.""I'm from an older generation. Whenever things get a bit uncertain we come back to gold coins and tell ourselves we'll always be able to sell them,"" she said. ""Gold has that safety factor.""Starsich said customers were of all ages and from all walks of life. Around a third of the Mint's sales are to foreign buyers.The Mint was founded in 1194 to strike coins from the silver paid as a ransom for Richard the Lionheart, after he had been seized and held captive by enemies near Vienna.Today, the Mint says its one-ounce Philharmonic gold coin, named after the world famous Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, is the top-selling gold bullion coin in Europe and Japan.HOARDERSAustria is a financially conservative country in which the public hoards cash and gold in times of crisis. The Mint says demand for gold is the highest it has been since it took on its current form in 1989.The Austrian National Bank, which owns the Mint, said in a presentation on Austrian households' finances in October that more gold had been bought in the two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic started than in the five years before that.Story continuesIt noted demand for gold in the first half of this year was higher even than in the first half of 2020, ""despite rising prices"", suggesting a rush to an asset seen as a safe haven.""It's a cascade,"" Starsich said of the causes. ""It started with the corona crisis, with the pandemic, when people were unsettled. Then in February Russia invaded Ukraine. That boosted sales again. And then the rising inflation over the summer/autumn, which increased sales further slightly.""This year at the end of November the Mint had sold more than 1.8 million ounces of gold and was approaching the record of more than 2 million set in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Sales in December are usually strong as gold is a traditional Christmas gift.Starsich added that the rush to gold was a global phenomenon seen at other major national mints. The gold price is currently around $1,800 an ounce, short of its peaks above $2,000 in March of this year and August 2020.He said he believed more Austrians were seeking to include gold in their portfolios as a hedge against stocks or to diversify their portfolios. Many analysts doubt the usefulness of gold to counter inflation, however.(Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)]"

That day, a nurse said, 42 other children had already been checked into the emergency unit, ravaged by hunger. There were 57 the day before that.Staff at the Benadir maternity and paediatric hospital said admissions of malnourished children have more than doubled their patient numbers over the past year. They are now treating over 1,000 emergency cases each month.Half a million children's lives are at risk from a looming famine in Somalia, according to the United Nations – that's more than in any country worldwide this century.Across Africa, from east to west, people are experiencing a food crisis that is bigger and more complex than the continent has ever seen, say diplomats and humanitarian workers.One in five Africans – a record 278 million people – were already facing hunger in 2021, according to data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It says the situation has worsened.The number of East Africans experiencing acute food insecurity – when a lack of food puts lives or livelihoods in immediate danger – has spiked by 60% in just the last year, and by nearly 40% in West Africa, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).Conflict and climate change are the long-term causes. Heavy debt burdens following the COVID-19 pandemic, rising prices and war in Ukraine have made things much worse as European aid has been sucked away, data and testimony from more than a dozen experts, donors, diplomats, medical staff and men and women in farms and marketplaces across nearly a dozen countries in Africa and beyond shows.Benadir Hospital is coping, said Dr. Aweis Olow, head of its paediatric department. But referrals from other clinics are accelerating: ""Without a lot of help from the rest of the world, the situation will be out of control.""Story continuesHere, alongside Isak's story, are five reasons Africa is suffering from the worst food crisis ever recorded:1. CLIMATE CHANGEEast Africa has missed four consecutive rainy seasons, the worst drought in 40 years, Michael Dunford, the WFP's East Africa director said.""The situation has never been as bad from a regional perspective as it is today,"" he told Reuters.African countries account for only around 3% of the global emissions responsible for climate change, but suffer more than any other region from its impact.Of the 20 nations ranked as most vulnerable to climate change, all but four are African, according to the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which measures countries' vulnerability.Some 22 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia face high levels of acute food insecurity due solely to the drought, a number projected to rise to up to 26 million by February if the rains again fail, the WFP said.The lack of rainfall has caused crops to fail. In northern Kenya, pastoralists dig deeper and deeper in search of water for their livestock. Traditional Maasai herders, whose culture revolves around their cows, face the choice of selling them or watching them die.On the other side of the continent, parts of West Africa have been hit by flooding after the most intense rainfall in 30 years. By mid-October, 5 million people and 1 million hectares of farmland were affected, according to the WFP.In Chad, over 19,000 head of livestock were swept away after rivers broke their banks, and in neighbouring Nigeria, flooding has hit 29 of the 36 states.In October in Benue state, part of Nigeria's agricultural heartland, farmer Abraham Hon looked out over water stretching to the horizon, covering some 20 hectares of his ruined rice fields.""You have drought in some places, then you have floods in some places,"" he said. ""That is a real shift.""""SAVING OUR CHILDREN""Isak's hometown, Dinsoor, is about 370 km (230 miles) from the capital in Somalia's Bay region. In June, she and her husband and children set out on foot, hoping to escape drought. The journey to Mogadishu took 12 days.They brought their savings of around $15, and some milk and food.They walked. ""We fled in the hope of saving our children,"" she said, seated on a hospital bed with her two girls – Nasib, 4, and Fardawsa, 3 – and an infant on her back.A day into the journey, they were ambushed by bandits. The robbers took their money and food, but spared their lives. They kept walking. A stranger gave the children a lift on his donkey cart.After four days they reached the regional capital, Baidoa, but couldn't find help there. Someone gave them a lift to Mogadishu. There, they found a spot on government land and built a shelter with other displaced people.Mohamud Abdi Ahmed, an official for the Garasbaley district where the family set up camp, said there were 50,000 displaced families there.""Sometimes it's difficult to count them, because more arrive every minute.""2: CONFLICT IN AFRICAConflict has long been a driver of hunger. War forces civilians from their homes, livelihoods, farms and food sources. It also makes it dangerous to deliver assistance.The number of displaced people in Africa has tripled over the past decade to a record 36 million in 2022, according to U.N. data. That represents almost half the displaced people in the world. Most were displaced internally within their own countries by conflict.Conflicts are worsening across the continent, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED), a crisis monitoring group.In 2016, it recorded 3,682 ""battles"" between armed groups in Africa. There were 7,418 in 2021.Isak's country, Somalia, has been unstable since a civil war in the early 1990s and today is a patchwork of clan strongholds, government-controlled areas and zones in the grip of al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group fighting to impose its own rule based on a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.A U.S. non-profit, Fund for Peace, ranks global states by how fragile they are. In 2022, 15 African nations occupied the top 20 slots of its rankings.SUFFOCATIONWhenever Isak had food, her youngest children were given top priority.""The children were getting weaker for months,"" she said. She and other mothers say malnourished children swell up and their skin thins. They bruise easily.Just a week after the family arrived in Mogadishu in June, two of Isak's daughters - 6-year-old Muna and 7-year-old Hamdi - fell ill one after another.They were weak and ran fevers, their legs bowed and limbs swelled. They began to cough and struggled to breathe.People who don't get enough minerals or vitamins can develop iron-deficiency anaemia, which means they do not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues throughout the body.So as children starve, their bodies slowly suffocate.Dr Olow said such cases are becoming commonplace. Children arriving at Benadir Hospital receive oxygen, emergency feeding and, if needed, blood transfusions. Just 3% die, Olow said.By the time Isak brought Muna and Hamdi for treatment, it was too late.""The doctors could not help them, because they were about to die when we reached the hospital,"" Isak said.3. CONFLICT IN EUROPERussia's invasion of Ukraine in February, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,"" added to Africa's problems.The crisis distracted wealthy governments' humanitarian agencies for the first half of this year, said a senior Western government official involved in humanitarian response in Africa, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.""When Ukraine happened, it sucked all the oxygen out of the room,"" he said.As the food crisis deepened earlier this year, the African Development Bank set up an emergency food production fund of $1.5 billion aimed at helping African farmers produce 38 million tonnes of wheat, corn, rice and soybeans.But needs across Africa's crises have risen by 13% over the past year alone, the data shows. While total donor funding over that time has increased 12%, it currently meets just half of requirements.European countries in particular have cut aid in Africa. European governments contributed 21% of humanitarian relief aid to African countries in 2022, down 16 percentage points since 2018.Some countries – such as the United States – have since boosted humanitarian assistance budgets, but the shortfalls remain, a Reuters analysis of U.N. data shows.Four of the five African countries receiving the most humanitarian funding under the 2022 aid appeal are located in or border the drought-stricken Horn of Africa region.That's leading to some tough choices.The WFP has, in some cases, been forced to reduce rations, said Ollo Sib, a senior researcher for the agency in West Africa.""We can keep people alive, but we don't just want to keep people alive,"" he said.Chad, for example, currently hosts 577,000 refugees from other countries – the largest group in West Africa. Since 2020, conflict there has also more than doubled the number of internally displaced Chadians to around 381,000.Faced with overwhelming needs, the WFP has already begun reducing rations for some refugees. And it told Reuters that, without more funding soon, it could be forced to suspend food assistance for all but the 10% of refugees considered the most vulnerable.Moscow's Ukraine campaign also throttled grain exports.The U.N. and Turkey brokered a deal in July to unblock three Black Sea ports. Under that initiative, 615 vessels left Ukrainian ports between Aug. 1 and Dec. 13 carrying over 13.8 million tonnes of corn, wheat, rapeseed and sunflower oil.Just 11 ships were destined for sub-Saharan Africa, however.""It's making a contribution. But there is no silver bullet,"" said the WFP's Dunford.Disruptions caused by that war have also provoked a fertiliser shortage. Where stocks are available, prices have risen beyond the means of many farmers. The result will be smaller harvests next year: In West Africa, the WFP estimates cereal production could fall 20%.""THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE DEAD""The Benadir hospital can't always help.""Sometimes mothers bring us dead children,"" said Farhia Moahmud Jama, head nurse at the paediatric emergency unit. ""And they don't know they're dead.""Weakened by hunger, camp residents are vulnerable to disease and people are dying due to a lack of food, said Nadifa Hussein Mohamed, who managed the camp where Isak's family initially stayed.""Maybe the whole world is hungry and donors are bankrupt, I don't know,"" she said. ""But we're calling out for help, and we do not see relief.""Isak and her husband said some nights, armed men threaten and beat the residents: ""They want to sell the land.""Ahmed, the district official, said security around the camps was tight.4. DEBTCOVID-19 left Africa facing the strongest economic headwinds in years, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).After years of borrowing, countries are struggling to service their debts. According to the IMF, 19 of sub-Saharan Africa's 35 low-income countries are in debt distress – where a government is unable to fulfil its financial obligations and debt restructuring is required – or at high risk of it.Ghana is an example. The country of 32 million people owed 476 billion cedis – or around $42 billion in September – over $1,300 per person. In July, the government turned to the IMF for relief. In December, Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said debt had topped 100% of Ghana's Gross Domestic Product.Ghana's currency, the cedi, is Africa's weakest. At its lowest level this year, in November, it sank by 59% against the dollar, straining the country's ability to pay for imports. Shopkeepers shut their doors temporarily in October in protest.In October, Ghana's inflation rate hit a new 21-year high of 40.4%, driven in large part by higher food costs. Cereal prices have gone up over 51%. Dairy and eggs by nearly 59%.Globally, prices of cereals, dairy, meat, vegetable oils and sugar climbed over 23% in 2021, the fastest in more than a decade, according to an index from the FAO.Food expenses constitute 40% of households' consumer spending in sub-Saharan Africa – the highest share in the world, according to the IMF.For Ghanaian Evelyn Lartey, a trip to market in the capital Accra has become a race.""The maths you use one day expires the next, and you don't know what are the real prices,"" she said. ""You just have to pay what you're told or else keep walking.""HEART PAINOn Wednesday Oct. 19, months after Muna and Hamdi's deaths, two of Isak's other daughters – Nasib and Fardawsa – could not sleep.""They were complaining of heart pain. It was 2 a.m.,"" she said.They set off for the hospital. There were few vehicles on the road, and none stopped when they tried to wave them down, so Isak and her husband carried the children for four km.A normal three-year-old child has between 11 and 13.7 grams of haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein that carries oxygen around the body, per decilitre of blood.Doctors told Isak that Fardawsa's blood contained 1 gram of haemoglobin per decilitre. She needed a blood transfusion.The medics couldn't find a vein on her hands, so they transfused the blood through a vein in her head.""It's not yet her time to die,"" her mother said, relieved.5. GOVERNMENTSAfrican governments have done little to prevent food crises from recurring.In a move to boost production, reduce import reliance and improve food security, leaders in 2003 pledged to commit at least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture and rural development within five years.By 2021, nearly two decades later, just two countries in sub-Saharan Africa – Mali and Zimbabwe – met that target.Instead, an analysis of 39 African countries by UK charity Oxfam found, spending on agriculture fell as a share of budgets between 2019 and 2021.Agriculture makes up nearly 20% of Africa's GDP and more than half of Africans work in the sector, according to the World Bank. Most of this is low-productivity subsistence farming, and the region is a net importer of staples including wheat, palm oil and rice, the FAO says.Productivity and crop yields have increased, but they are still the lowest in the world and the FAO says they come nowhere close to keeping up with the continent's growing population, which the U.N. forecasts will more than triple to 4.3 billion by the end of the century.So agricultural production per capita is falling, according to the FAO.Self-sufficiency for major food commodities is decreasing. Without action, the World Bank says Africa's food import bill, which stood at $43 billion in 2019, could rise to $110 billion in 2025.""We have 65% of the world's available arable land. We have to wake up,"" Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, told Reuters. ""For me, the bare minimum is that Africa is able to feed itself.""""STRENGTH, BUT NO WORK""Nasib and Fardawsa spent a week in the hospital, receiving blood transfusions, medicine and nutritional biscuits. They recovered, but then Isak's four-month-old, Farhan, needed care.He received an emergency transfusion and treatment. The doctor prescribed syrups and supplementary iron tablets that the family cannot afford.""I don't have any money,"" she said.In search of aid and security, in November the family moved onto an abandoned military camp closer to the city centre.They are no longer harassed, but attacks by Islamist militants periodically send the city into lock-down. Isak's husband, Mohamed Ibrahim, hoped he could earn money for food in town, working as a porter.""I have strength but no work. I have a wooden wheelbarrow,"" he said.

During the pandemic, when most other retailers were suffering from a shortage of supplies, the company managed to stay afloat by maintaining the necessary inventory levels and not suffering from the same overstocks that troubled many of its competitors. This solid track record has set it up for continued success, despite the ongoing disruptions to the retail business.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with M. Click here to check it out. M 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MPeter Lynch Chart of MInflation is probably the most significant headwind for Macys since it is a high-end store. The company also pays dividends frequently and has a substantial share repurchase program. With a reasonably priced stock, the company looks strong moving forward.Financials are encouragingOn Nov. 17, the company posted revenue of $5.2 billion for the third quarter, a 3.9% decline from the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales were down 1%, with online sales dropping by 9% and brick-and-mortar sales falling 1%. Earnings per share clocked in at 39 cents, a significant drop from 76 cents in the prior-year quarter.The profits were affected by several factors, including a 230 basis point contraction in merchandise margins, a 4.3% increase in operating expenses and higher delivery costs due to increased fuel prices.Given the significant challenges facing the retail market, the results Macy's reported begin to shine through. Although investors might initially feel that its results are unimpressive, deeper analysis reveals positives. Stepping back and examining the top and bottom lines demonstrate the nationwide retail giant made progress above expected goals. Improved performance is encouraging for Macy's shareholders and a sign of hope for other retailers looking to prosper in the coming months.Story continuesInventory shortages helped MacysMany major chains faced inventory shortages due to the bottleneck in manufacturing and shipping caused by the pandemic. Macys, however, did not face any issues and could charge its preferred product prices. With other retailers facing a glut of inventory, Macys had ideal merchandise levels.However, with the competition offering specials to offload building stocks, Macys, too, will need to lower its prices through sales and promotions. The change in prices is bound to lower profitability in the short term. However, with more people buying in brick-and-mortar stores rather than ordering online, the sales effect will be partially offset due to the store avoiding high shipment costs.Inflation remains a significant threatWith inflation steadily increasing, Macy's and other retailers now face a considerable challenge. Consumers are heeding their budget-conscious attitude and focusing more on necessities and cheaper products, even at the cost of quality and comfort. It is not that they are unwilling to pay extra for quality; it is just that they cannot afford to do so.This presents a major issue to the high-end store model, which relies on people's willingness to pay a premium for products with better build quality or higher prestige factors such as brand name. If inflation continues to rise in the coming quarters, these companies will likely feel the pinch as consumers actively avoid purchasing anything beyond their essential needs.Emphasis on automationMacys also sells its products online and is currently automating processes to make them more efficient and help merchandise reach customers faster. Its online sales declined 9% compared to the third quarter of 2021, which may have prompted the company to fix its supply chain issues through automation.It will be crucial for retailers to not only maintain their sales, but improve them further. A more efficient supply chain should help the company lower its online sales costs. It also shows the company is moving forward and willing to update its sales channels.Investors get returns through dividend and share buybacksMacy's has proven over the years that it values its shareholders, consistently paying them dividends and keeping the stock attractive with a $2 billion share repurchase program. The company repurchased $500 million of stock in 2021 alone.With these practices in place, Macy's could be a great option for those looking to get their money back and then some. As one of the leading companies that pays dividends, Macy's is worth considering if you are looking to invest your money in a reliable source.TakeawayDespite the instability and volatility of the current economic landscape, Macy's has risen to the challenge. The iconic department store chain is continually innovating and adapting to the ever-shifting demands of consumers, yet remains firmly focused on its dedication to quality merchandise and sound fiscal management.Throughout the holiday season, which is traditionally a peak sales period for Macy's and other retailers, expert analysts keep their eyes on this stalwart company, With forward-thinking strategies in place, the success of Macy's bottom line takes center stage again heading into one of its most important times of the year.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It also was the softest inflation reading seen in a year.Focus now turns to the conclusion of the Fed’s final meeting this year, due later in the day. The central bank is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points (bps).But markets will be closely watching an address by Fed Chair Jerome Powell after the meeting, to see whether the central bank thinks inflation has cooled sufficiently to begin further tapering its pace of interest rate hikes.A rally in risk-driven markets was also cut short on Tuesday by anticipation of the Fed, given that the central bank has maintained a largely hawkish stance against inflation this year.A series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed battered metal markets this year, as the bank made combating price pressures its main priority.

If you want to read about some more best performing stocks in November, go directly to 5 Best Performing Stocks in November.After the eventful month of October, which is widely known for stock market crashes, the United States (US) stock market jumped back on a revival path in November, generally considered one of the best months of the year for investors. The relative performance of stocks during the month, compared to the year, which has been the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 in more than a decade, revived hopes of a market rally at the turn of the year. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose by more than 5% in November, up 14% compared to the beginning of October. The month of November is also renowned for Black Friday sales, a day on which big national retailers put inventories on sale. This November, on Black Friday, the shopping crowds and sales were better compared to last year, according to some estimates, although they still fell short of the traffic seen before the advent of the pandemic. Overall, sales for US retail outlets increased by 2.3% year-on-year to a record $9.1 billion. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), 196.7 million Americans went shopping over the Black Friday weekend. The NRF report claims that this was nearly a 9.4% increase from last year’s 179.8 million shoppers. Moreover, Adobe Analytics reported that online sales on Cyber Monday totaled $11.3 billion, up 5.8% from 2021 and Black Friday online sales were $9.12 billion, 2.3% above 2021’s $8.92 billion. The gain that the S&amp;P 500 registered in November brought the losses year-to-date for the index to around 14.3% at the end of November. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.67% during the time and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 jumped 5.95%.Heading into 2023, it is likely that interest rates will rise, though slower than previously expected, despite peak inflation. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which discourages companies from borrowing and investing to expand their businesses. This results in a macro slowdown for investors, and even earnings growth tends to stagnate. Some of the best-performing stocks despite these concerns in November included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that registered a more than 20% gain in share price in November were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices.

(NYSE:FCX), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is one of the stocks that registered an impressive gain in November.In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.”9. Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34     Gain in Share Price in November: 49%Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) engages in the research, development, and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart.

(NASDAQ:ABMD) stock and lowered the price target to $350 from $425, noting that models in medical technology had to be updated to account for several considerations, such as inflationary pressures and currency headwinds that had not been adequately captured.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1 billion in Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD), compared to 30 in the preceding quarter worth $1.04 billion.8.

Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favour The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped-up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44     Gain in Share Price in November: 30%SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SEDG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition. High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 6. Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45     Gain in Share Price in November: 28%Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. On November 4, Microchip Technology shares were higher after its FQ2 earnings destroyed the general agreement mark.

Here is what the fund said:“We initiated a new investment in Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP). A microchip is a global provider of microcontrollers and analog semiconductor chips. These products are near-ubiquitous in our daily lives, whether we know it or not. They serve as the embedded brains of all sorts of electronic devices and end products that are increasingly smart and connected to the internet, such as cars, phones, kitchen appliances, factory equipment, and so on. Importantly, microcontrollers and analog chips represent a small percentage of the end product bill of materials, yet account for a disproportionately large portion of the performance characteristics of that product. Product cycles and customer retention are very long, as once designed into a product, Microchip is rarely replaced. Growth should be well above average for many years given the increasing electronification around us. In addition, management has announced its intention to return a sizeable portion of its cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We like this dual threat of growth together with excess cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Stocks in November. Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy20 Countries That Produce the Most Electric Power15 Countries That Produce the Most OilDisclosure.

If you want to read about some more gambling countries, go directly to 5 Biggest Gambling Countries In The World.Gambling, also known as betting, involves wagering something of value, with an uncertain outcome on the line. Gambling is generally referred to as a combination of consideration, risk, and a prize. A few examples include instant lotteries, Bingo, betting on billiards or pool, card games, and casino games. Globally, gambling is perceived as a harmless or low-risk social activity for participants of all ages. Teenagers engage in both regulated and non-regulated forms of gambling. Gambling is one of the biggest industries in the world. The commercial casino industry has seen significant growth over the last few decades as licensed casinos have expanded to new markets and generated record-breaking revenue figures. According to a recent report, the market size of the casino and online gambling industry worldwide reached a total of $231 billion in 2021. Online gambling alone is expected to exceed $114 billion in size before the end of this decade, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 11% over the forecast period that runs up to 2028. Rapid urbanization is one of the key factors driving the growth of the market, in addition to the increasing penetration of the internet across the globe. Furthermore, legalization and the cultural approval of online betting in various developed countries is also providing a boost to the gambling market. Online sports companies are also attaining high-profile sponsorships with various football and racing clubs, helping attract new users. Convenient access to online casinos through mobile phones is also creating a positive impact. Some of the biggest gambling companies in the world include Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS). These operate in some of the biggest gambling hubs in the world found in countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and China, among others discussed in detail below. Even though the pandemic brought the industry to a standstill, the gambling market has recovered and is on the growth track once again. Story continuesOur MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the gambling industry. The countries are ranked according to the gambling gross win in each country, as assessed by H2 Gambling Capital. The details of each gambling country are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. 15 Biggest Gambling Countries In The WorldPixabay/Public DomainBiggest Gambling Countries In The World15. NetherlandsTotal Gambling Gross Win: $3 Billion Gambling in the Netherlands is regulated by the gaming authority, KSA, which enforces provisions of the Dutch Gambling Act of 1964. The Holland Casino is one of the biggest gambling firms in the country but has reduced in popularity in recent years as the focus shifts away from physical stores to online gambling. The Netherlands has steadily become one of the biggest gambling countries in the world over the past few years. It has a rich history in the betting world. One of the oldest lotteries of the world, called Staatsloterij, has been played in the country since 1726. The Netherlands has popular casinos such as Haarlemmermeerse Bos, Holland Casino Valkenburg, Holland Casino Venlo, and Gran Casino Tiel. The country is working to make flexible legislation and focus on the internet gaming sector to achieve higher tax revenues from local and international operators and players in the gambling universe. Just like Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in the US, the Netherlands is home to some of the biggest gambling establishments in the world. 14. RussiaTotal Gambling Gross Win: $4 Billion     Russia, one of the largest countries in the world with an area of 6,612,074 sq miles and population of 144 million, is gradually becoming one of the leading gambling countries in the world as well. The country had strict legislation regarding gambling during the former Soviet Union in the 1920s, but these were eased during the 1990s. Online gambling is prohibited in the country, but the land based gambling market has been thriving since 1987. Some of the prominent land-based gambling casinos in Russia are Kazino Sochi, Shambhala Casino, Casino Sobranie, ltai Palace Casino, and Crystal and Tigre De Cristal Resort &amp; Casino. These casinos are based in few of the regions where the government has allowed gambling. Russia has attracted tourists and locals to take part in these gambling activities as these casinos are some of Europe’s finest ones, offering a wide variety of games to the players.13. PhilippinesTotal Gambling Gross Win: $5 Billion The Philippines has become one of the best tourist spots for gambling over the years. The gambling sector is governed and controlled by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, which is the country’s government-owned department. The country, with 115 million population and an area of 115,831 sq miles, has several casino resort businesses. The tourists are attracted to the country for not only its beautiful islands but also casinos, such as Resorts World, and City of Dreams, among others. There are more than fifty casinos, private and publicly-owned, in the country. The popular games, Sabong and e-Sabong, have continued to generate $1 billion in revenue for gambling companies every year, and hold a cultural importance for the locals.12. SingaporeTotal Gambling Gross Win: $6 Billion   Singapore is one the leading gambling countries in the world, although it is also one of the smallest in terms of overall area and population, with 5.8 million population and an area of 277 square miles. Singapore Pools, which is a state-sponsored lottery company, was founded in 1968 and got permission to begin sports betting as well. This led towards more revenue generation for the government, which gradually made more gambling-friendly laws. The government recently awarded two casino licenses, to the Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands, which are some of the biggest casinos in the world. The latter, popular as a resort for multi-millionaires, has over 2,500 gaming machines. The country has one of the highest annual gambling losses per person in the world.11. SpainTotal Gambling Gross Win: $10 Billion     Spain, with an area of 195,364 square miles and population of 47 million, is one of the biggest gambling countries in the world with a rich history in gambling. Many former emperors and their families were obsessed with gambling and lotteries. The country legalized gambling in 1981, although it had been popular as a sport for centuries. It is estimated that almost 80% of adults in the country play the popular Christmas lottery game called El Gordo which generates almost $1 billion every year. Spain is also one of the leading markets for the sports betting industry. Major international sports events, such as the Spanish Grand Prix and Madrid Masters, attract many sports bettors. There is the traditional bullfighting every year as well that makes the country more famous in the gambling and betting markets. 10. South KoreaTotal Gambling Gross Win: $11 Billion South Korea is one of the leading gambling countries in the world with a population of 51 million and an area of 38,623 sq miles. However, casinos and sports betting continue to be a risky venture in the country due to strict legislations.

This takes the annual payment to 1.0% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. See our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, Zoetis was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 33.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendZoetis Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.26, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.50. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 19% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Zoetis has been growing its earnings per share at 18% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like Zoetis' DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Zoetis that you should be aware of before investing.

Capturing and commercializing this gas would simultaneously reduce GHG emissions by more than 750 Mt CO2e*, an amount approximately the size of Germany's total annual emissions.Methane emission reductions are particularly critical to limit near-term warming as methane is a highly potent, short-lived climate pollutant (with over 80 times more global warming potential than CO2 over a 20-year period), and is estimated to have contributed roughly 30% of global warming to date.**""With natural gas prices at historic levels and energy security returning as a global priority, efforts to capture and commercialize methane are increasingly economic and present a win-win proposition,"" said Amb. Carlos Pascual, senior vice president, global energy and international affairs, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""Accelerating efforts to bring these projects forward can provide much-needed supply to the global market while supporting energy security and climate imperatives in the energy transition.""Story continuesThe spike in global gas prices—which began in Fall 2021 and then amplified by the conflict in Ukraine—have particularly enhanced the near-term economics for methane capture projects in regions that have access to the global gas market, the analysis finds.For a methane capture project deployed next year, 10-year revenues are now expected to be 140-240% higher than they otherwise would have been prior to the price spike. Even as natural gas prices stabilize in the longer term, forecasted revenues remain elevated compared to pre-war price forecasts (56%-93% higher for a project deployed in 2026 and 31%-38% higher for a project deployed in 2030).""The elevated price outlook for natural gas has created a substantial economic opportunity to capture flared gas and methane emissions, especially in the near term,"" said Eleonor Kramarz, vice president, energy transition consulting, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""While these opportunities will remain economic over the longer-term, the strongest incentives are for acting sooner rather than later when it comes to bringing new projects online.""Advancing methane and flare capture and commercialization projects benefit from well-established technologies that already exist at scale, meaning that there are few technological barriers to deployment, the analysis notes. Still, other impediments need to be overcome.The analysis identifies key barriers for each of the six target regions across four major categories—export capacity, capital availability, commercial and financing environment, and security risk—and lays out pathways that would enable projects to move forward.""While the paths forward will be different in each region, there is a consistent need for clear project implementation roles, stronger collaboration between private and public organizations and improved capital availability,"" Kramarz said. ""Bringing together key constituencies will be essential to address barriers and deliver new sources of supply that can strengthen energy security while reducing emissions.""About the Study:The study examines target regions where efforts to capture methane could quickly increase the supply of natural gas in global markets while reducing methane emissions.S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights identified key barriers to capturing and commercializing methane across the six target regions selected. Next, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights developed abatement pathways that could address these barriers and unlock methane emission reduction opportunities. This work consisted of:Developing rough estimates of country-level methane emissions from venting, fugitives and flaring, and associated abatement costs. This analysis utilized IEA's methane tracker, SkyTruth flaring data, and S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights infrastructure and field-level data.Identifying key barriers to capture and monetize methane based on export capacities, capital availability, commercial and financing environment and security risks.Developing abatement pathways that could address key barriers and facilitate gas capture and commercialization projects.The study contributes to the continuing dialogue about achieving Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 by quantifying the requirements of that goal and benchmarking them against the supply response. These insights are intended to facilitate well-informed policy choices.The analysis and metrics developed during the course of this research and its conclusions represent the independent analysis and views of S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.The study was supported by the Environmental Defense Fund.Additional Resources:Download the executive summary here: https://bit.ly/Methane-Consulting* Calculation assumes methane or flared gas captured is replacing other natural gas use. For flare capture projects, 2% of methane is assumed to remain uncombusted. Calculation uses an 86x multiplier to approximate methane's 20-year global warming potential (relative to CO2). Using a 25x multiplier to approximate methane's 100-year global warming potential results in over 250 Mt CO2e.** See IEA, ""Methane and climate change,"" available at https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/methane-and-climate-change, accessed November 22, 2022Media Contacts: S&amp;P Global: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, Jeff.marn@spglobal.comS&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, Global/EMEA: Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Americas: Kathleen Tanzy + 1 917-331-4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan + 65-6597-6241, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

Behind its quiet facade lies a warren of workshops where modern machines melt metals and thump out money.""At the moment, every gold coin that comes off the coining press has already been sold,"" said Starsich. ""Right now we could sell three times as many as we are able to produce.""The Mint's shop, a modern corner of the building, has had a long queue outside daily for months. Among those standing in line was pensioner Renate, one of the few willing to talk about her purchasing habits.""I'm from an older generation. Whenever things get a bit uncertain we come back to gold coins and tell ourselves we'll always be able to sell them,"" she said. ""Gold has that safety factor.""Starsich said customers were of all ages and from all walks of life. Around a third of the Mint's sales are to foreign buyers.The Mint was founded in 1194 to strike coins from the silver paid as a ransom for Richard the Lionheart, after he had been seized and held captive by enemies near Vienna.Today, the Mint says its one-ounce Philharmonic gold coin, named after the world famous Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, is the top-selling gold bullion coin in Europe and Japan.HOARDERSAustria is a financially conservative country in which the public hoards cash and gold in times of crisis. The Mint says demand for gold is the highest it has been since it took on its current form in 1989.The Austrian National Bank, which owns the Mint, said in a presentation on Austrian households' finances in October that more gold had been bought in the two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic started than in the five years before that.Story continuesIt noted demand for gold in the first half of this year was higher even than in the first half of 2020, ""despite rising prices"", suggesting a rush to an asset seen as a safe haven.""It's a cascade,"" Starsich said of the causes. ""It started with the corona crisis, with the pandemic, when people were unsettled. Then in February Russia invaded Ukraine. That boosted sales again. And then the rising inflation over the summer/autumn, which increased sales further slightly.""This year at the end of November the Mint had sold more than 1.8 million ounces of gold and was approaching the record of more than 2 million set in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Sales in December are usually strong as gold is a traditional Christmas gift.Starsich added that the rush to gold was a global phenomenon seen at other major national mints. The gold price is currently around $1,800 an ounce, short of its peaks above $2,000 in March of this year and August 2020.He said he believed more Austrians were seeking to include gold in their portfolios as a hedge against stocks or to diversify their portfolios. Many analysts doubt the usefulness of gold to counter inflation, however.(Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)]"

That day, a nurse said, 42 other children had already been checked into the emergency unit, ravaged by hunger. There were 57 the day before that.Staff at the Benadir maternity and paediatric hospital said admissions of malnourished children have more than doubled their patient numbers over the past year. They are now treating over 1,000 emergency cases each month.Half a million children's lives are at risk from a looming famine in Somalia, according to the United Nations – that's more than in any country worldwide this century.Across Africa, from east to west, people are experiencing a food crisis that is bigger and more complex than the continent has ever seen, say diplomats and humanitarian workers.One in five Africans – a record 278 million people – were already facing hunger in 2021, according to data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It says the situation has worsened.The number of East Africans experiencing acute food insecurity – when a lack of food puts lives or livelihoods in immediate danger – has spiked by 60% in just the last year, and by nearly 40% in West Africa, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).Conflict and climate change are the long-term causes. Heavy debt burdens following the COVID-19 pandemic, rising prices and war in Ukraine have made things much worse as European aid has been sucked away, data and testimony from more than a dozen experts, donors, diplomats, medical staff and men and women in farms and marketplaces across nearly a dozen countries in Africa and beyond shows.Benadir Hospital is coping, said Dr. Aweis Olow, head of its paediatric department. But referrals from other clinics are accelerating: ""Without a lot of help from the rest of the world, the situation will be out of control.""Story continuesHere, alongside Isak's story, are five reasons Africa is suffering from the worst food crisis ever recorded:1. CLIMATE CHANGEEast Africa has missed four consecutive rainy seasons, the worst drought in 40 years, Michael Dunford, the WFP's East Africa director said.""The situation has never been as bad from a regional perspective as it is today,"" he told Reuters.African countries account for only around 3% of the global emissions responsible for climate change, but suffer more than any other region from its impact.Of the 20 nations ranked as most vulnerable to climate change, all but four are African, according to the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which measures countries' vulnerability.Some 22 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia face high levels of acute food insecurity due solely to the drought, a number projected to rise to up to 26 million by February if the rains again fail, the WFP said.The lack of rainfall has caused crops to fail. In northern Kenya, pastoralists dig deeper and deeper in search of water for their livestock. Traditional Maasai herders, whose culture revolves around their cows, face the choice of selling them or watching them die.On the other side of the continent, parts of West Africa have been hit by flooding after the most intense rainfall in 30 years. By mid-October, 5 million people and 1 million hectares of farmland were affected, according to the WFP.In Chad, over 19,000 head of livestock were swept away after rivers broke their banks, and in neighbouring Nigeria, flooding has hit 29 of the 36 states.In October in Benue state, part of Nigeria's agricultural heartland, farmer Abraham Hon looked out over water stretching to the horizon, covering some 20 hectares of his ruined rice fields.""You have drought in some places, then you have floods in some places,"" he said. ""That is a real shift.""""SAVING OUR CHILDREN""Isak's hometown, Dinsoor, is about 370 km (230 miles) from the capital in Somalia's Bay region. In June, she and her husband and children set out on foot, hoping to escape drought. The journey to Mogadishu took 12 days.They brought their savings of around $15, and some milk and food.They walked. ""We fled in the hope of saving our children,"" she said, seated on a hospital bed with her two girls – Nasib, 4, and Fardawsa, 3 – and an infant on her back.A day into the journey, they were ambushed by bandits. The robbers took their money and food, but spared their lives. They kept walking. A stranger gave the children a lift on his donkey cart.After four days they reached the regional capital, Baidoa, but couldn't find help there. Someone gave them a lift to Mogadishu. There, they found a spot on government land and built a shelter with other displaced people.Mohamud Abdi Ahmed, an official for the Garasbaley district where the family set up camp, said there were 50,000 displaced families there.""Sometimes it's difficult to count them, because more arrive every minute.""2: CONFLICT IN AFRICAConflict has long been a driver of hunger. War forces civilians from their homes, livelihoods, farms and food sources. It also makes it dangerous to deliver assistance.The number of displaced people in Africa has tripled over the past decade to a record 36 million in 2022, according to U.N. data. That represents almost half the displaced people in the world. Most were displaced internally within their own countries by conflict.Conflicts are worsening across the continent, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED), a crisis monitoring group.In 2016, it recorded 3,682 ""battles"" between armed groups in Africa. There were 7,418 in 2021.Isak's country, Somalia, has been unstable since a civil war in the early 1990s and today is a patchwork of clan strongholds, government-controlled areas and zones in the grip of al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group fighting to impose its own rule based on a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.A U.S. non-profit, Fund for Peace, ranks global states by how fragile they are. In 2022, 15 African nations occupied the top 20 slots of its rankings.SUFFOCATIONWhenever Isak had food, her youngest children were given top priority.""The children were getting weaker for months,"" she said. She and other mothers say malnourished children swell up and their skin thins. They bruise easily.Just a week after the family arrived in Mogadishu in June, two of Isak's daughters - 6-year-old Muna and 7-year-old Hamdi - fell ill one after another.They were weak and ran fevers, their legs bowed and limbs swelled. They began to cough and struggled to breathe.People who don't get enough minerals or vitamins can develop iron-deficiency anaemia, which means they do not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues throughout the body.So as children starve, their bodies slowly suffocate.Dr Olow said such cases are becoming commonplace. Children arriving at Benadir Hospital receive oxygen, emergency feeding and, if needed, blood transfusions. Just 3% die, Olow said.By the time Isak brought Muna and Hamdi for treatment, it was too late.""The doctors could not help them, because they were about to die when we reached the hospital,"" Isak said.3. CONFLICT IN EUROPERussia's invasion of Ukraine in February, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,"" added to Africa's problems.The crisis distracted wealthy governments' humanitarian agencies for the first half of this year, said a senior Western government official involved in humanitarian response in Africa, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.""When Ukraine happened, it sucked all the oxygen out of the room,"" he said.As the food crisis deepened earlier this year, the African Development Bank set up an emergency food production fund of $1.5 billion aimed at helping African farmers produce 38 million tonnes of wheat, corn, rice and soybeans.But needs across Africa's crises have risen by 13% over the past year alone, the data shows. While total donor funding over that time has increased 12%, it currently meets just half of requirements.European countries in particular have cut aid in Africa. European governments contributed 21% of humanitarian relief aid to African countries in 2022, down 16 percentage points since 2018.Some countries – such as the United States – have since boosted humanitarian assistance budgets, but the shortfalls remain, a Reuters analysis of U.N. data shows.Four of the five African countries receiving the most humanitarian funding under the 2022 aid appeal are located in or border the drought-stricken Horn of Africa region.That's leading to some tough choices.The WFP has, in some cases, been forced to reduce rations, said Ollo Sib, a senior researcher for the agency in West Africa.""We can keep people alive, but we don't just want to keep people alive,"" he said.Chad, for example, currently hosts 577,000 refugees from other countries – the largest group in West Africa. Since 2020, conflict there has also more than doubled the number of internally displaced Chadians to around 381,000.Faced with overwhelming needs, the WFP has already begun reducing rations for some refugees. And it told Reuters that, without more funding soon, it could be forced to suspend food assistance for all but the 10% of refugees considered the most vulnerable.Moscow's Ukraine campaign also throttled grain exports.The U.N. and Turkey brokered a deal in July to unblock three Black Sea ports. Under that initiative, 615 vessels left Ukrainian ports between Aug. 1 and Dec. 13 carrying over 13.8 million tonnes of corn, wheat, rapeseed and sunflower oil.Just 11 ships were destined for sub-Saharan Africa, however.""It's making a contribution. But there is no silver bullet,"" said the WFP's Dunford.Disruptions caused by that war have also provoked a fertiliser shortage. Where stocks are available, prices have risen beyond the means of many farmers. The result will be smaller harvests next year: In West Africa, the WFP estimates cereal production could fall 20%.""THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE DEAD""The Benadir hospital can't always help.""Sometimes mothers bring us dead children,"" said Farhia Moahmud Jama, head nurse at the paediatric emergency unit. ""And they don't know they're dead.""Weakened by hunger, camp residents are vulnerable to disease and people are dying due to a lack of food, said Nadifa Hussein Mohamed, who managed the camp where Isak's family initially stayed.""Maybe the whole world is hungry and donors are bankrupt, I don't know,"" she said. ""But we're calling out for help, and we do not see relief.""Isak and her husband said some nights, armed men threaten and beat the residents: ""They want to sell the land.""Ahmed, the district official, said security around the camps was tight.4. DEBTCOVID-19 left Africa facing the strongest economic headwinds in years, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).After years of borrowing, countries are struggling to service their debts. According to the IMF, 19 of sub-Saharan Africa's 35 low-income countries are in debt distress – where a government is unable to fulfil its financial obligations and debt restructuring is required – or at high risk of it.Ghana is an example. The country of 32 million people owed 476 billion cedis – or around $42 billion in September – over $1,300 per person. In July, the government turned to the IMF for relief. In December, Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said debt had topped 100% of Ghana's Gross Domestic Product.Ghana's currency, the cedi, is Africa's weakest. At its lowest level this year, in November, it sank by 59% against the dollar, straining the country's ability to pay for imports. Shopkeepers shut their doors temporarily in October in protest.In October, Ghana's inflation rate hit a new 21-year high of 40.4%, driven in large part by higher food costs. Cereal prices have gone up over 51%. Dairy and eggs by nearly 59%.Globally, prices of cereals, dairy, meat, vegetable oils and sugar climbed over 23% in 2021, the fastest in more than a decade, according to an index from the FAO.Food expenses constitute 40% of households' consumer spending in sub-Saharan Africa – the highest share in the world, according to the IMF.For Ghanaian Evelyn Lartey, a trip to market in the capital Accra has become a race.""The maths you use one day expires the next, and you don't know what are the real prices,"" she said. ""You just have to pay what you're told or else keep walking.""HEART PAINOn Wednesday Oct. 19, months after Muna and Hamdi's deaths, two of Isak's other daughters – Nasib and Fardawsa – could not sleep.""They were complaining of heart pain. It was 2 a.m.,"" she said.They set off for the hospital. There were few vehicles on the road, and none stopped when they tried to wave them down, so Isak and her husband carried the children for four km.A normal three-year-old child has between 11 and 13.7 grams of haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein that carries oxygen around the body, per decilitre of blood.Doctors told Isak that Fardawsa's blood contained 1 gram of haemoglobin per decilitre. She needed a blood transfusion.The medics couldn't find a vein on her hands, so they transfused the blood through a vein in her head.""It's not yet her time to die,"" her mother said, relieved.5. GOVERNMENTSAfrican governments have done little to prevent food crises from recurring.In a move to boost production, reduce import reliance and improve food security, leaders in 2003 pledged to commit at least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture and rural development within five years.By 2021, nearly two decades later, just two countries in sub-Saharan Africa – Mali and Zimbabwe – met that target.Instead, an analysis of 39 African countries by UK charity Oxfam found, spending on agriculture fell as a share of budgets between 2019 and 2021.Agriculture makes up nearly 20% of Africa's GDP and more than half of Africans work in the sector, according to the World Bank. Most of this is low-productivity subsistence farming, and the region is a net importer of staples including wheat, palm oil and rice, the FAO says.Productivity and crop yields have increased, but they are still the lowest in the world and the FAO says they come nowhere close to keeping up with the continent's growing population, which the U.N. forecasts will more than triple to 4.3 billion by the end of the century.So agricultural production per capita is falling, according to the FAO.Self-sufficiency for major food commodities is decreasing. Without action, the World Bank says Africa's food import bill, which stood at $43 billion in 2019, could rise to $110 billion in 2025.""We have 65% of the world's available arable land. We have to wake up,"" Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, told Reuters. ""For me, the bare minimum is that Africa is able to feed itself.""""STRENGTH, BUT NO WORK""Nasib and Fardawsa spent a week in the hospital, receiving blood transfusions, medicine and nutritional biscuits. They recovered, but then Isak's four-month-old, Farhan, needed care.He received an emergency transfusion and treatment. The doctor prescribed syrups and supplementary iron tablets that the family cannot afford.""I don't have any money,"" she said.In search of aid and security, in November the family moved onto an abandoned military camp closer to the city centre.They are no longer harassed, but attacks by Islamist militants periodically send the city into lock-down. Isak's husband, Mohamed Ibrahim, hoped he could earn money for food in town, working as a porter.""I have strength but no work. I have a wooden wheelbarrow,"" he said. But most people use the services of tuk-tuks instead.After months on the move – from her village to the city, from camp to camp, and hospital to hospital – Isak is running out of energy. She believes she herself and two other children are now also anaemic.""If he gets a dollar or two, this is not even enough for food for the children.""

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Mastercard certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard peKeen to find out how analysts think Mastercard's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Mastercard would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 23% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 51% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 17% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Mastercard is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Mastercard's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Mastercard that we have uncovered.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Mastercard, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

In this series, we're talking with some of Qualcomm's most prolific inventors about their work, the impact of their inventions, and their inspiration.Qualcomm, Tuesday, December 13, 2022, Press release pictureDo you remember when you browsed the web on a smartphone for the first time? Or when you discovered the magic of a text? Thank 3G for that.How about your first quality video stream or video call? That was 4G.Today, 5G is pushing boundaries further, allowing you to stream movies in Ultra HD, play mobile games with console-level graphics, hail a rideshare in an instant, and more. Beyond the smartphone, 5G is accelerating digital transformation across countless industries, revolutionizing mobile computing, and ushering in an era of intelligent, connected automobiles.Each new wireless communication ""G"" opens the door to something previously unimagined - something Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. inventor Dr. Tao Luo (Senior Director, Engineering) knows firsthand. Since joining Qualcomm in 2004, Luo has invented thousands of different patented technologies, and he currently serves as the systems lead for wireless research and development (WRD) on Qualcomm's 5G mmWave project.We recently caught up with Luo to talk about the impact of his inventions, his role in wireless research and development, and his contributions to 3G, 4G, and 5G technology innovations that are paving the way to 6G.The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.Can you tell us a little about your research and the role you have at Qualcomm?So, I've been at Qualcomm for almost 20 years doing various projects on fundamental cellular research. Currently, I lead the system engineering team for our millimeter-wave research project, which includes system design, analysis, standardization, and prototyping for 5G, 5G advanced, and now 6G.We hear a lot about how 5G is a world-changing technology that's ushering in a new era of connectivity. But can you tell us a little about the origins of 5G, and explain the connection between 5G and 4G?That's a good question, and my answer is simple: 5G is like an enhanced version of 4G with a lot of useful new features added in. Many components of 5G were borrowed and evolved from 4G. Take the idea of cell search that I worked on, for example.Story continuesWhen a phone powers on, the first thing it needs to do is understand which cell tower it can connect to. These different towers have different IDs (there're over a thousand different possible IDs in 5G, up from around 500 in 4G), and your phone needs to determine and rank which of these towers has the strongest signal to connect to in order to start a call or begin sharing data.This cell search is based on two signals: the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and the secondary synchronization signal (SSS). This started as a technique in 4G for the same purpose - but I came up with the idea of using a PSS index to generate one sequence to scramble another sequence for the SSS, thereby randomizing interference between different nearby cell towers and giving your phone a clearer idea of which tower has the best signal to connect to. So, this fundamental aspect of how 5G works can trace its origins back to a 4G idea.Could you give us a sense of the amount of inventions in 5G that came from ideas generated during the 4G era?I would say a significant amount of the cell search techniques began as 4G research. During the research and development phases of 4G, we came up with a lot of ideas. Some of them went into 4G, but some were added into 5G later. A significant percentage of 5G came out of 4G - both the ideas that got adopted in the 4G standard, and many ideas we came up with that weren't initially part of the standard. A lot of that research became part of the 5G standards. That's how it works: we continuously solve problems, evolve ideas, do research, test things out. We never stop.Can you talk about what it's like specializing in wireless research and development?Although our work is highly technical, whether we're at implementation, prototyping, or working with our product team, we're continually asking, ""How do we implement our ideas in the real world?"" Plus, we build on our work. For example, when I joined Qualcomm, it was still the 3G era. Later, I worked on the transition to 4G. At that time, we were generating a significant number of inventions and insights that would eventually lead to 5G. Specializing in wireless research and development, I try to emphasize this point: a focus on implementation plus strong product interaction creates more useful inventions.And of course, we're always looking ahead. We want to make sure the work is aligned with our goals, but we also want to be pushing the boundaries of what's possible.I understand Qualcomm has a culture of innovation. Can you share specifically what that looks like in your day-to-day work?Qualcomm is like heaven for an inventor. There are so many smart people around, and we're continually bouncing ideas off one another. Even with just a few words exchanged, we're coming up with very smart, interesting, useful ideas - while keeping an eye on the bigger picture. It helps when all your colleagues are also nerds who are really obsessed with the fine details.

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can also take a look at 5 Best Performing Leveraged ETFs in 2022.What Are Leveraged ETFs?Leveraged ETFs are exchange-traded funds that use financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. They are designed to provide investors with a high degree of exposure to a particular asset class or market segment. Unlike traditional ETFs, leveraged ETFs are designed to magnify the return of the underlying index. They do this by using derivatives such as options and futures contracts, as well as borrowing money to increase the size of their portfolio. This can lead to amplified gains, but also amplified losses.It's a Two Way StreetLet's take an example to understand the behavior of a leveraged ETF. A 3x leveraged ETF seeks to deliver three times the daily performance of the underlying index. So, if the underlying index rises 1%, the ETF will rise 3%. Conversely, if the underlying index falls 1%, the ETF would decline 3%. Leveraged ETFs are a popular tool for traders and investors who want to take advantage of short-term price movements. Leveraged ETFs can also be used to hedge against market volatility or to diversify a portfolio. However, investing in leveraged ETFs carries a high degree of risk by nature, and investors should evaluate their risk tolerance before exploring this instrument.By design, leveraged ETFs are more suitable for day traders or investors with a short-term time horizon. For investors that do not have the risk tolerance for trading leveraged ETFs, they can opt for individual stocks that are among these funds' holdings. Some of the most popular long-term stocks among elite money managers and also present in leveraged ETFs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).Photo by Behnam Norouzi on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyTo determine the best performing leveraged ETFs in 2022, we screened for leveraged ETFs with varying ratios including 1.25, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x. We reviewed these ETFs' year-to-date performance, as of December 9, and narrowed down our selection to the best performing leveraged ETFs. We used the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark to compare the performance of each ETF. Though some of them are down, they are not down as much as the S&amp;P 500, which closed a little above 3,900 on December 9 and is down more than 18% for the year.Along with each ETF, we have mentioned its leverage ratio, the index it tracks, the technique it uses, its portfolio breakdown, and most notable holdings.

We think this pricing power should protect profitability during the acute inflationary phase and potentially lead to margin expansion when cost pressures abate. Linde also continues to be well-positioned on hydrogen and carbon capture with contract-backed project capex likely accelerating in the medium term as the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rolls out.”In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is also a stock that is popular among elite money managers.9.

Market uncertainty, paired with growing recession fears and a declining macroeconomic outlook, has investors running towards safe haven assets and defensive strategies to protect their portfolios and seek upside potential. Individuals who have long investing horizons and are risk averse gravitate towards dividend stocks, as these offer cumulative growth since the earnings can be reinvested in the portfolio. Nick Lentini of the Morgan Stanley Equity Strategy team said on November 9:“The investing backdrop of the past year, driven by macroeconomic conditions and combined with the rising risk of recession, has fueled outperformance for many dividend-paying stocks.”Energy, Packaged Food, Beverages and Household Products, Utilities, and Banks are some of the sectors providing attractive yields and dividend growth opportunities despite the pressured economic environment. Cash flows from dividend payments are a significant source of income and return for investors. Those who wish to protect themselves against the challenging macro backdrop can look out for dividend ETFs, which offer exposure to some of the best income stocks like Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), and Energy Transfer L.P.

This comes with a few caveats, though. The baseline is by comparison to use of Merck's blockbuster Keytruda alone, which the vaccine is used with, and is only useful for stage 3 and 4 melanoma patients after surgery to remove tumor. So a little bit of a caveat there.But the big takeaway, of course, is mRNA's proof of concept. Thanks to the pandemic, they got the boost they needed with that. And now they got a step further, showing that you can train a person's T-cells to recognize and fight cancer. So I like to call it a bit of a Neil Armstrong moment.

Analysts recommended investing in income-generating stocks because they could stabilize overall portfolios through dividends. Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”6.

Most notably is that the vaccine is given post-surgery (after the removal of tumors) and in combination with Merck's blockbuster drug Keytruda. The 44% represents the improvement in efficacy when compared to Keytruda alone. In addition, the vaccine is given in nine doses every 21 days, in combination with one dose of Keytruda every 21 days up to 18 times.The duo have partnered since 2016 with a focus on cancer, where Merck is a dominant player for therapies, but the Phase 2 results are the first promising for a any cancer vaccine.Bancel said he came into the attempt ""humbly"" and said the company needed to ""do better or should we go home,"" when compared to Keytruda's success.Keytruda ""is an amazing drug, but it doesn't work for everybody,"" Bancel said.Bancel said he hopes the vaccine will also prove efficacious for those patients for whom Keytruda alone did not work.SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND - NOVEMBER 21: A healthcare employee prepares a syringe with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the Dennis Avenue Health Center in Silver Spring, Maryland on November 21, 2022. While COVID-19 remains a serious concern for this holiday season, this year two other common respiratory viruses, influenza and RSV, are wreaking havoc particularly in the D.C. area, which is one of the regions with the highest flu activity in the country. (Eric Lee for The Washington Post via Getty Images)Market and manufacturingMerck invested $250 million into the endeavor, and Moderna boasts $17 billion of cash on hand from the success of its Covid-19 vaccine Spikevax.""We're not going to be shy on deploying that cash to create impact for patients and value for shareholders,"" Bancel said.Keytruda is a leader in cancer therapy, with 54% of the melanoma market share, bringing in about $17.2 billion in revenue per year — that's the equivalent of Moderna's cash on hand by comparison.Story continuesKeytruda is used for more than melanoma, however, including for cancers that affect breasts, skin, colon, uterus, cervix, stomach, kidney, gut, liver, bladder, as well as Hodgkins lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma.The ongoing clinical trial has proven that Moderna's vaccine works well side-by-side with Keytruda, with about the same safety profile.That opens the door to testing all the other indications of Keytruda, which Bancel said will be happening quickly. The hope is to have multiple trials simultaneously that will test these indications, so that more patients can be eligible for the vaccine more quickly.Bancel noted that the buildout of manufacturing from the COVID vaccine will come into play in the potential ramp up, but there is a key difference.It has to be set up to produce personalized, targeted products per patient, rather than ""to make a very big cut of mRNA like we did for the COVID-19 vaccine,"" he said.That is where the endeavor could become a more costly one. Keytruda already costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per year per patient. When asked how the vaccine would be priced, Bancel balked.""We will work on pricing with Merck as we get closer to launch, but now the focus is getting the drug to patients,"" he said.Next stepsHow soon Moderna and Merck will enter the market with the product remains to be seen. The companies hope to start a Phase 3 trial soon, as well as begin other indications in 2023. Bancel said the companies are already looking on how to prioritize the other indications.This could finally give Moderna the break it needs to move out of the category of having a single revenue stream, which Bancel has been aiming for as he often highlights the dozens of other vaccine candidates in Moderna's R&amp;D pipeline.When asked about potential for side effects, such as the myocarditis concerns that arose from the COVID vaccine, Bancel said that the safety profile was strong and the makeup of the cancer vaccine was exactly the same as the COVID vaccine.He noted that the results Tuesday were beyond his wildest expectations.""In my books, total kind of home run,"" Bancel said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The global economy has been rattled by the Ukraine war, lingering supply chain troubles and a sweeping energy crisis in Europe. Aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation have kept investors on tenterhooks.Year to date, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have dropped 28.8% and 16.3%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also down 6.4%.Identifying stocks to add to the investment portfolio in such a highly volatile market scenario can be quite challenging.Nevertheless, few Dow stocks have bucked the general trend and have seen price appreciation in the year. Investors might consider adding these stocks, which have proven resilient compared to the Dow Jones index.Dow Jones equity index consists of 30 of the country’s most prominent and valuable companies or blue-chip companies. Adding blue chip stocks to one’s portfolio amid a volatile market scenario is mostly considered as a safe investment bet.Blue chip stocks are usually less volatile to market vagaries. These companies generally have a large market cap, solid cash flows, a healthy balance sheet and, in most cases, a stable dividend policy.Therefore, we bring you the top five stocks — Chevron Corporation CVX, Merck &amp; Co MRK, Amgen AMGN, The Travelers Companies, Inc TRV and International Business Machines Corporation IBM — that have fared relatively better than the Dow Jones Index this year for investment consideration.5 Stocks that Minimized Dow Jones LossesChevron: Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world and is the only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares of Chevron have risen 44.7% year to date, outperforming Dow Jones and the Zacks sub-industry’s 43.7% gain during the same period.Chevron is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. The energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, owing to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, the San Ramon, CA-based company had $15.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $23.6 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization of a modest 12.9%.Chevron's earnings and cash flows have been steadily improving, boosted by higher crude realizations and a recovery in consumption. Earlier in the year, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by 6% to $1.42 per share (or $5.68 per share annualized) and promised anything between $5 billion and $15 billion worth of buybacks each year. Chevron recorded $37.1 billion in cash flow from operations during the nine months ended Sep 30, surging from $19.7 billion a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by $1.12 to $19.17 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 135.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck &amp; Co: Merck &amp; Co boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. Merck’s shares have risen 42.2% this year so far compared with 12% gain by the sub-industry.Keytruda has played an important role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years. Keytruda sales are benefiting from healthy momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 1 cent to $7.38 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 22.6%.Amgen: Amgen is one of the prominent biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets. Amgen’s shares have risen 23% this year so far, outperforming a decrease of 18.5% for the sub-industry.Amgen’s performance is being driven by strength in key drugs, namely Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and Evenity.

195,0be6dae9-8993-3320-b77e-ec9f316bad62,MRK,2022-12-14,Moderna and Merck’s cancer vaccine trial shows promising initial results,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/moderna-merck-cancer-vaccine-trial-145015200.html,1670943015,VIDEO,"['MRK', 'MRNA']","[Yahoo Finance’s Anjalee Khemlani joins the Live show to discuss initial cancer vaccine trial results for Moderna and Merck.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Checking in now. Also, we're going to take a look at shares of Moderna, MRNA. Those are moving on the news that the company's cancer vaccine, along with a Merck cancer drug, has shown success in a mid-stage clinical trial. For more on this, we bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani, following the story and joins us now for more. Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So really good news for this cancer vaccine, the personalized cancer vaccine for melanoma, especially late-stage and high-risk individuals. The way that Moderna and Merck fashioned this clinical trial is that post-surgery individuals will get doses of both Merck's blockbuster drug KEYTRUDA, as well as doses of Moderna's personalized vaccine.And the deal has been a $250 million infusion from Merck to co-develop and share in profits for this. Moderna is working on the trial design with Merck, which obviously has a vast experience with cancer, and all types of cancer. So this really opens the door for more potential products down the line.Now, the results from this phase II is preliminary. It's just from the company, a 44% reduction in the risk of recurring disease or death. That's really important. And this is a trial-- this is the phase II of that trial. So they're going to be starting that phase III pretty shortly. So a lot going on, a lot of exciting news. This is the first testament and proof case for cancer vaccines.- An, you're going to be talking to Stéphane Bancel, the Moderna CEO, in the 10:00 AM hour about this discovery. What are we hearing from Moderna, initially here, about the significance of this?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: It is not an exaggeration to say that they are beyond fired up. I had a quick chat with Stéphane Bancel earlier. And really, he pointed to the tale of what happened with the COVID product, right? Till now, they've been trying to fight the perception that they're just a one-product company. And this really opens the door for that.Story continuesHe told me, quote, ""We have $17 billion of cash on hand. We're not going to be shy in deploying that. We're going to be very aggressive with the capital we have because we believe we can save a lot of people's lives."" So right there, you can hear the optimism and the confidence in moving forward on this product.- Yeah, and that seems to be reflecting in what the shares are doing, as well, today, up right now by about 16%.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Not bad.- Thanks, Anjalee. Looking forward to hearing from Stéphane a little bit later on. Thanks.]"

(MRK) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-merck-co-inc-140002626.html,1670940002,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of -14.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.38 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.4%. The $59.16 billion and $58.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and -1.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more AI companies, go directly to 5 Biggest AI Companies In The World.Artificial intelligence tools have been rapidly evolving across the world to personalize experiences for individuals, helping businesses with digital adoption, and lowering overall cyber security risks for financial institutions. Globally, AI has been integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations as well. As 5G deployment increases, the real-world uses of AI in automation, cloud, and large databases, are likely to drive the demand for the new technology even further, a prime example being the popularity of smart homes and smart cities. One of the most important parts of this growth is the chip industry. According to a report by the Business Research Company, the artificial intelligence chip market size is expected to grow from $10 billion in 2021 to $15 billion in 2022, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of more than 42%. Despite supply issues due to rising demand and the global geopolitical crisis, the AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49 billion in 2026. The use of AI in fields like food and beverage development is growing too. Another important market trend in the sector, evidenced by the focus of the biggest AI companies in the world like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), is the AI-enabled industrial robotics development. AI tools are being used on social media, for big data analytics, the Internet of things, and cloud computing. The integration of these digital technologies into corporate operations, more commonly referred to as digital transformation, is on the rise as well. Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The details of each AI company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. Hedge fund sentiment is also included for further clarity on the money being poured into these firms and the confidence that elite investors have in their success. Story continues15 Biggest AI Companies In The WorldBiggest AI Companies In The World15. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Market Capitalization: $13 Billion SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) operates as an enterprise application software company worldwide. On December 7, the firm announced that UST, a leading digital transformation solutions company, in collaboration with SAP, had signed a partnership with Intel, an American multinational corporation and technology company, and a top AI firm, to assess and enable the digital transformation journey for small and medium-sized enterprises in northern Malaysia. On July 21, SAP SE reported that it had acquired Askdata, a search-driven analytics startup. The company said that this acquisition will help organizations to make better-informed decisions by leveraging AI-driven natural language searches. The users of SAP will be able to search, interact and collaborate on live data to maximize business insights. Askdata’s IP will become part of the SAP Business technology Platform and it will contribute to a next-generation lightweight analytics experience for SAP Analytics Cloud solution customers and line-of-business applications. On December 2, Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Buy rating on SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stock and raised the price target to EUR 135 from EUR 130.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) with 6.8 million shares worth more than $549.6 million. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is one of the biggest AI companies in the world. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for long-term investors.”14. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Market Capitalization: $30 Billion     Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) provides industrial automation and digital transformation solutions in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America. On November 10, ZEDEDA, a leader in edge orchestration, revealed a key supply agreement with Rockwell Automation to provide industrial automation with distributed edge management and orchestration capabilities. This automation will be provided by edge AI and edge computing. Rockwell Automation offers AI products related to industrial automation and information. For example, the FactoryTalk Analytics LogixAI module of the firm provides embedded analytics that empowers customers to apply machine learning concepts without needing expertise in data science. Applying analytics within the controller application is a new fundamental approach to achieving process improvements. Rockwell Automation is among a group of global innovators exploring how the United Kingdom’s second-largest water company, Severn Trent, can use artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to improve the region’s environmental well-being. Rockwell also offers specialized products in cyber security, machine learning and other emerging technologies.On November 17, Baird analyst Richard Eastman maintained an Outperform rating on Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) stock and raised the price target to $265 from $250, noting that tighter integration of hardware, software and services and scalable platforms accepting of vertical-specific applications is driving broader penetration for the firm. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 35 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $768.8 million in Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), compared to 28 in the preceding quarter worth $399.5 million.In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), a Milwaukee-based industrial automation company, struggled early in the year with component shortages that prevented it from clearing its overflowing order books and rising input costs. Uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine prompted management to warn in May of lower profits for the rest of the year. Behind the frustrations, however, were indications that the business outlook remained strong, as order volume continued to grow following price increases at the end of 2021. In the recent quarter, the company reported stronger results despite ongoing supply chain issues that hindered its ability to fulfil orders. To mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, Rockwell has been accumulating inventory and redesigning certain products. We believe Rockwell will see its revenues expand as its resilience improves and supply shortages recede.”13. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Market Capitalization: $40 Billion Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) offers internet search services in China. It operates through Baidu Core and iQIYI segments. On November 29, Baidu revealed its plans in celebration of Apollo Day to build the world’s largest autonomous ride-hailing service area in 2023.

Baidu App enables users to access their search, feed, content and other services through mobile devices. Baidu App offers twin-engine search and feed functions that leverage the AI-powered algorithms and deep user insight functions. Baidu is a leading AI company with a strong internet foundation. Baidu Brain is another core artificial intelligence innovation from the company that features advanced technology for recognizing and processing speech, images and words as well as building user profiles based on big data analysis. On December 6, Capital analyst Rob Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock and lowered the price target to $167 from $185, noting that another y/y decline in advertising revenue is anticipated in the fourth quarter before a return to growth in the first quarter and a 5% growth rate for 2023.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Ariel Investment is a leading shareholder in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) with 2.6 million shares worth more than $305.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Ariel Investment, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“China’s internet search and online community leader Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) also weighed on relative results in the quarter. Continuing macro headwinds driven by China’s Zero-Covid policy are resulting in sluggish advertising trends. Looking ahead, the company remains committed to sustainable, profitable growth as management works to improve overall operational efficiency, executing its strategic commitments around technological innovation and the transition to a green economy. We also continue to be enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”12. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Market Capitalization: $60 Billion   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology announced that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) mobile memory is continuing to gain market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies, an American multinational corporation, the latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. Micron’s mobile memory and storage solutions are built to fuel the next wave of 5G and AI-enabled smartphone experiences. Micron has created the world's fastest discrete graphics memory solution: GDDR6X. Launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce 3090 and GeForce 3080 GPUs, GDDR6X takes graphics to new levels of gaming realism and unleashes high-performance AI inference. Micron has been chasing maximum bandwidth memory to support gaming and professional visualization for a long time. It also includes how Micron has achieved staggering speeds with GDDR6X, the future of AI training with HBM2E, and other high-bandwidth products. On December 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it would not be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Market Capitalization: $90 Billion     General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. It operates through four segments: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare segments. On November 27, GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of General Electric, introduced SIGNA Experience. SIGNA is a new platform of four synergistic transformative technologies that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning in MRI scanning. On September 5, General Electric announced the launch of its first Made in India Optima IGS 320, an AI-powered Cath lab, to advance cardiac care in India. Optima IGS 320 was built at Wipro GE Healthcare’s new factory launched under the production-linked incentive scheme in Bengaluru. The Cath lab leverages the GE proprietary AutoRight technology. AutoRight is the first neural network-based interventional image chain. AutoRight features Artificial Intelligence that automatically optimizes image and dose parameters in real-time, which enables clinicians to focus their attention and expertise on patients. On December 5, Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase maintained a Buy rating on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock and raised the price target to $94 from $89, noting that the industrial economy can show unprecedented resilience, as the supply chain is only just beginning to heal, backlogs are extended, and order growth generally remains quite healthy.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Group is a leading shareholder in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) with 13.8 million shares worth more than $852 million.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Longleaf Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments has strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Market Capitalization: $118 Billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel AI announced that it has introduced FakeCatcher, a new real-time Deepfake Detector, that analyzes the Blood Flow in video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%. Intel offers an unparalleled AI development and deployment ecosystem combined with a heterogeneous portfolio of AI-optimized hardware. Intel's goal is to make it as seamless as possible for every developer, data scientist, researcher, and data engineer to accelerate their AI journey from the edge to the cloud. Intel has acquired multiple companies across various AI disciplines. Some of the AI-focused companies that Intel has acquired in recent years include DeepMind in 2014 for $500 million, Habana Labs in 2019 for $2 billion, and Granulate in 2022 for $650 million. Intel developed oneDNN to help companies optimize computer hardware such as CPUs and streamline the development of deep learning applications. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company announced a cost reduction plan, which should help but doesn’t help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Market Capitalization: $113 Billion     Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. On December 2, Advanced Micro Devices announced the expansion of its partnership with Viettel High Tech, a member of Viettel group, to exploit a 5G network field to serve the latter’s more than 130 million mobile customers globally. Viettel is using AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC devices. AMD works extensively with the AI open community to promote and extend machine &amp; deep learning capabilities and optimizations to help to broaden the range of workloads. AMD’s ROCm open software platform is constantly evolving to meet the needs of the machine learning community. With the latest release of the company’s ROCm 5.0, developers are equipped with turn-key AI framework containers on AMD Infinity Hub, improved tools, and streamlined installation, and can expect to experience reduced kernel launch times and faster application performance. On November 14, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $75, noting that the PC segment has been early in digesting inventory and been dragging down growth, but overall CPU shipments are annualizing to about 230MM units in fourth quarter, which is far below even the most bearish market forecasts for PCs in 2023.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.99 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), compared to 87 in the previous quarter worth $4.8 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more)8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Market Capitalization: $134 Billion  International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide.

On October 17, analyst David Grossman maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $140 from $150, noting that the company is defensive and likely impacted less than most large-cap tech, but not immune to slowing GDP growth.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)7. Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and lowered the price target to $52 from $54, noting that the upside from the fiscal first quarter beat is tempered by a more cautious view on a tougher macro backdrop in upcoming periods. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth.

Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest AI Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

Shares fell another 1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, and the company's ticker page remains among the most visited on Yahoo Finance.""The decline is likely in response to the CPI [Consumer Price Index] report that showed U.S. air fares fell 3% from October to November,"" CFRA analyst Colin Scarola wrote in a note moments after the latest CPI reading. ""However, the CPI air fare data has not historically been representative of UAL's pricing trends. For example, the CPI data showed U.S. air fares fell 8% from Q2 to Q3, but UAL's actual pricing was down just 1% Q/Q in Q3. Further, some moderation in air fares is to be expected given how much fuel prices have fallen recently, allowing airlines to charge less while increasing profitability. Notably, UAL forecasts a $3.61 average fuel price for Q4, but as of today, jet fuel prices are under $2.70 (-25% vs. forecast).""Rival airlines such as Delta, Jetblue, and Southwest also saw large losses on Tuesday.Scarola added that the sell-off was overdone and reiterated a Buy rating on United's stock. Her also raised his earnings estimates on United for 2022, 2023, and 2024 and took the price target to $60 from $59.The move in United's stock occurred as the airline made a big play toward improving profitability over the next decade.Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal speaks during a joint press event with United Airlines at the Boeing manufacturing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, on December 13, 2022. (Photo by Logan Cyrus / AFP)The carrier announced Tuesday it placed an order for 100 of Boeing's top-of-the-line 787 Dreamliners with options to purchase 100 more. In a press release, United described the purchase as ""the largest widebody order by a U.S. carrier in commercial aviation history"" and said it expects to take delivery between 2024 and 2032.United also exercised options to purchase 44 Boeing 737 Max aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2026 while adding that the orders will lead it to hire 15,000 new employees in 2023.Story continues""We're setting records every month on travel demand,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said on Yahoo Finance Live described the ability to add more planes as ""a bet that it's an option on a really strong recovery, which we think is what's going to happen, but not a requirement if the recovery is less robust than we anticipate.""And while Kirby said that ""if you squint hard... [you could] see what I would call pre-recessionary behavior,"" he reaffirmed that this year's ongoing travel rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic has continued and ""demand is really strong for us right now.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Boeing Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.61bUS$8.34bUS$9.20bUS$9.46bUS$9.69bUS$9.91bUS$10.1bUS$10.3bUS$10.6bUS$10.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 2.41%Est @ 2.28%Est @ 2.19%Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$4.3kUS$7.2kUS$7.4kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.4kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.4kUS$5.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$61bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$193bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$193b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$92bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$153b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$187, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boeing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.024. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

208,ebcb976a-701a-30a2-83d7-253d29937006,SO,2022-12-14,Investor Optimism Abounds The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) But Growth Is Lacking,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-optimism-abounds-southern-company-120028920.html,1671019228,STORY,['SO'],"[The Southern Company's (NYSE:SO) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 22.8x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Southern as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Southern peKeen to find out how analysts think Southern's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Southern?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Southern's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 12% gain to the company's bottom line. Still, lamentably EPS has fallen 29% in aggregate from three years ago, which is disappointing. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 10% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.1% each year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Southern is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of Southern's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Southern, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can also take a look at 5 Best Performing Leveraged ETFs in 2022.What Are Leveraged ETFs?Leveraged ETFs are exchange-traded funds that use financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. They are designed to provide investors with a high degree of exposure to a particular asset class or market segment. Unlike traditional ETFs, leveraged ETFs are designed to magnify the return of the underlying index. They do this by using derivatives such as options and futures contracts, as well as borrowing money to increase the size of their portfolio. This can lead to amplified gains, but also amplified losses.It's a Two Way StreetLet's take an example to understand the behavior of a leveraged ETF. A 3x leveraged ETF seeks to deliver three times the daily performance of the underlying index. So, if the underlying index rises 1%, the ETF will rise 3%. Conversely, if the underlying index falls 1%, the ETF would decline 3%. Leveraged ETFs are a popular tool for traders and investors who want to take advantage of short-term price movements. Leveraged ETFs can also be used to hedge against market volatility or to diversify a portfolio. However, investing in leveraged ETFs carries a high degree of risk by nature, and investors should evaluate their risk tolerance before exploring this instrument.By design, leveraged ETFs are more suitable for day traders or investors with a short-term time horizon. For investors that do not have the risk tolerance for trading leveraged ETFs, they can opt for individual stocks that are among these funds' holdings. Some of the most popular long-term stocks among elite money managers and also present in leveraged ETFs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).Photo by Behnam Norouzi on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyTo determine the best performing leveraged ETFs in 2022, we screened for leveraged ETFs with varying ratios including 1.25, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x. We reviewed these ETFs' year-to-date performance, as of December 9, and narrowed down our selection to the best performing leveraged ETFs. We used the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark to compare the performance of each ETF. Though some of them are down, they are not down as much as the S&amp;P 500, which closed a little above 3,900 on December 9 and is down more than 18% for the year.Along with each ETF, we have mentioned its leverage ratio, the index it tracks, the technique it uses, its portfolio breakdown, and most notable holdings. These ETFs are ranked in increasing order of their year-to-date performance.Best Performing Leveraged ETFs in 202210. ProShares Ultra Basic Materials (NYSEARCA:UYM)Leverage: 2xYTD Return as of December 9: -17.81%The ProShares Ultra Basic Materials (NYSEARCA:UYM) invests directly and through derivatives in stocks that belong to the materials sector.

We think this pricing power should protect profitability during the acute inflationary phase and potentially lead to margin expansion when cost pressures abate. Linde also continues to be well-positioned on hydrogen and carbon capture with contract-backed project capex likely accelerating in the medium term as the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rolls out.”In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is also a stock that is popular among elite money managers.9.

Solid performances of the Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses are fuelling growth.Its earnings growth history is also impressive. Over the past five years, CI’s bottom-line growth of 17.5% outperformed the industry average of 8.2%. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average of 9.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $23.14 per share, indicating a 13% rise from $20.47 a year ago. It has witnessed four upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against no movement in the opposite direction. The consensus estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $178.7 billion, signaling a 2.7% year-over-year rise.The reaffirmed forecast last month has aided the stock’s momentum. Solid customer retention and new client wins are expected to benefit its U.S. commercial business. This is likely to enable CI to reach its 2022 earnings goal of a minimum of $23.10 per share.Strategic acquisitions are helping the company to expand its scale and tap into new markets. This will enable the company to increase memberships. CI anticipates total medical customer growth of at least 900,000 in 2022 compared with the prior mentioned number of at least 800,000.With the growing proportion of older people in the population, the demand for Cigna’s products is expected to increase. Also, rising employment and economic recovery will benefit its commercial business. This is expected to lead to higher premiums.Cigna’s focus on enhancing pharmacy offerings in 2023 can be a significant growth driver. It revealed plans to include biosimilars as preferred products within its commercial formularies from 2023. The biosimilars, approved by the FDA, are prescription medications that are quite affordable, safe to consume and have proved to be effective. This move reflects Cigna’s continuous efforts to bring substantial cost savings and increased choices to its clients who want to avail of specialty medications.Story continuesWhile the factors stated above are driving the stock, there are a few headwinds to look out for. A debt-laden balance sheet and rising operating expenses are concerning.At the September-quarter end, CI had a long-term debt of $28,090 million and a short-term debt of $3,488 million. Total benefits and expenses also rose 5% year over year in the first nine months of 2022. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will keep driving the company’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Elevance Health Inc.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.84bUS$3.21bUS$3.73bUS$4.31bUS$4.74bUS$5.09bUS$5.39bUS$5.64bUS$5.86bUS$6.05bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 9.85%Est @ 7.49%Est @ 5.84%Est @ 4.68%Est @ 3.87%Est @ 3.30% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$2.7kUS$2.8kUS$3.1kUS$3.3kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$124bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$124b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$63bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$95b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$526, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Northrop Grumman as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.894. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Northrop Grumman, we've put together three important factors you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Northrop Grumman has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does NOC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can also take a look at 5 Best Performing Leveraged ETFs in 2022.What Are Leveraged ETFs?Leveraged ETFs are exchange-traded funds that use financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. They are designed to provide investors with a high degree of exposure to a particular asset class or market segment. Unlike traditional ETFs, leveraged ETFs are designed to magnify the return of the underlying index. They do this by using derivatives such as options and futures contracts, as well as borrowing money to increase the size of their portfolio. This can lead to amplified gains, but also amplified losses.It's a Two Way StreetLet's take an example to understand the behavior of a leveraged ETF. A 3x leveraged ETF seeks to deliver three times the daily performance of the underlying index. So, if the underlying index rises 1%, the ETF will rise 3%. Conversely, if the underlying index falls 1%, the ETF would decline 3%. Leveraged ETFs are a popular tool for traders and investors who want to take advantage of short-term price movements. Leveraged ETFs can also be used to hedge against market volatility or to diversify a portfolio. However, investing in leveraged ETFs carries a high degree of risk by nature, and investors should evaluate their risk tolerance before exploring this instrument.By design, leveraged ETFs are more suitable for day traders or investors with a short-term time horizon. For investors that do not have the risk tolerance for trading leveraged ETFs, they can opt for individual stocks that are among these funds' holdings. Some of the most popular long-term stocks among elite money managers and also present in leveraged ETFs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).Photo by Behnam Norouzi on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyTo determine the best performing leveraged ETFs in 2022, we screened for leveraged ETFs with varying ratios including 1.25, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x. We reviewed these ETFs' year-to-date performance, as of December 9, and narrowed down our selection to the best performing leveraged ETFs. We used the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark to compare the performance of each ETF. Though some of them are down, they are not down as much as the S&amp;P 500, which closed a little above 3,900 on December 9 and is down more than 18% for the year.Along with each ETF, we have mentioned its leverage ratio, the index it tracks, the technique it uses, its portfolio breakdown, and most notable holdings. These ETFs are ranked in increasing order of their year-to-date performance.Best Performing Leveraged ETFs in 202210.

We think this pricing power should protect profitability during the acute inflationary phase and potentially lead to margin expansion when cost pressures abate. Linde also continues to be well-positioned on hydrogen and carbon capture with contract-backed project capex likely accelerating in the medium term as the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act rolls out.”In addition to Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is also a stock that is popular among elite money managers.9.

215,87f17d10-1f90-335c-92f1-f26754860d0c,NOC,2022-12-14,Raytheon (RTX) Gets a Nod for a $6B Share Buyback Program,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raytheon-rtx-gets-nod-6b-142602997.html,1670941562,STORY,"['RTX', 'NOC', 'CW']","[Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX recently received a nod from its board of directors for a share buyback program. Per the authorization, the company can repurchase up to $6 billion of the outstanding common stock. This signifies RTX’s strong financial strength and ability to deploy capital effectively.The recently announced program is a replacement to the previously announced share buyback authorization of $3.5 billion of its common stock under the Dec 7, 2021 share repurchase program.Can Raytheon Sustain the Share Buyback Program? A share buyback program is backed by the strong financial position of a company and its ability to generate excess cash to distribute among shareholders, mainly to increase their worth. It is imperative to mention that Raytheon Technologies’ cash and cash equivalents were $5.38 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, up sequentially from $4.77 billion.Also, Raytheon Technologies expects to generate free cash flow worth approximately $6 billion in 2022. This highlights its capability to sustain the share buyback program through excess cash.Moreover, the generation of higher revenues and earnings from business operations should assist in attaining a steady inflow of cash in the business to support the company’s intent to increase shareholders’ value. RTX’s total revenues increased 5% year over year in the last reported quarter, thus signifying a strong top line.Going forward, the company expects revenues in the range of $67.00-$67.30, while earnings are anticipated in the band of $4.70-$4.80 per share. The midpoint of the guided range suggests an improvement of 11.2% from the earnings of $4.27 reported in 2021. The midpoint of the revenue guidance range signifies growth of 4.3% from the prior-year reported figure.Additionally, the solid order flow and the backlog of the company are likely to remain strong. These make us optimistic about the revenue growth prospects of the company, which will boost its bottom line in the long run.Story continuesRaytheon Technologies’ total backlog was approximately $168 billion as of Sep 30, 2022 compared with $156 billion as of Dec 31, 2021. Underpinned by such solid revenue generation prospects and strength in business activities, one may safely conclude that RTX may continue to effectively deploy capital through share buyback activity.Peer MovesDefense majors that have repurchased shares to show the financial strength of their businesses and increase shareholders’ worth are as follows:In November 2021, Northrop Grumman NOC announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC to repurchase $500 million of the common stock.Northrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. Shares of NOC have increased 41.9% in the past year.Curtiss-Wright CW has been rewarding shareholders with increased share repurchase activity and dividends regularly. In November 2021, the company hiked its share buyback authorization by $100 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Curtiss-Wright’s 2022 earnings suggests a growth rate of 10.6% from the prior-year reported figure. CW shares have soared 28% in the past year.Hexel Corporation HXL has $217 million remaining authorization under the share repurchase program as of Sep 30, 2022. The company expects free cash flow of $100 million in 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hexel’s 2022 earnings implies a solid growth rate of 344.4% from the prior-year reported figure. HXL shares have risen 18% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Raytheon Technologies have rallied 18.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 6.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In that same time, the Consumer Discretionary sector gained 1.28%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.09%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nike as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be December 20, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.66, down 20.48% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.58 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.97 per share and revenue of $48.97 billion, which would represent changes of -20.8% and +4.84%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Nike is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Digging into valuation, Nike currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 37.73. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 18.8, so we one might conclude that Nike is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 3.72. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Shoes and Retail Apparel was holding an average PEG ratio of 3.72 at yesterday's closing price.The Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 225, which puts it in the bottom 11% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(NKE): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-nike-inc-140002655.html,1670940002,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of -20.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -20.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 indicates a change of +26.1% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nike, the consensus sales estimate of $12.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.8%. The $48.97 billion and $52.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +7.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

222,216cd83f-41e4-35bc-b6d9-2382b85bb584,PFE,2022-12-14,Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-nyse-pfe-stock-130027413.html,1671022827,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) stock is up by a considerable 16% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pfizer's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Pfizer How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:32% = US$30b ÷ US$93b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.32 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Pfizer's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Pfizer has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 8.6% net income growth seen by Pfizer over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Pfizer's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 14% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PFE? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Pfizer Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Pfizer has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 73%, meaning that it is left with only 27% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Moreover, Pfizer is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 42% over the next three years. However, Pfizer's future ROE is expected to decline to 15% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryIn total, it does look like Pfizer has some positive aspects to its business. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The government is paying around the same amount per course under the new contract.Pfizer, which also sells a COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech SE, is expected to top $100 billion in revenue this year, more than half of which is expected to come from its COVID business. Before the new contract, analysts had forecast Paxlovid sales would top $22 billion in 2022 and be close to $12 billion next year, according to Refinitiv data.The U.S. drugmaker said last year that it could produce up to 120 million courses of Paxlovid this year.As of Nov. 30, Pfizer had shipped almost 37 million courses of Paxlovid to 52 countries around the world, it said in a statement. That includes all 20 million courses previously ordered by the U.S. government.The two-drug oral treatment is currently available for free in the United States, where more than 9 million courses have been delivered to pharmacies, and patients have used over 6 million courses of the treatment, according to government data.Last December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Paxlovid for use in people ages 12 and older at risk of severe illness from COVID-19.In Pfizer's clinical trial, Paxlovid was shown to reduce hospitalizations and death by around 90% for unvaccinated people at risk for serious disease. In another trial, Pfizer was not able to show the treatment was effective in those considered at standard risk, including vaccinated patients.

If you want to read about some more biotech stocks with the biggest upside, go directly to 5 Biotech Stocks With The Biggest Upside.The biotechnology sector has been one of the most profitable growth spaces in the stock market over the past few years. Investors are thus always looking for potential bargains in the industry that might pay off handsomely in the coming years. Amid a macro slowdown and recession fears, these bargains are readily available at much discounted rates, but identifying winners, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), from amongst them is a somewhat difficult task. Biotechnology is a branch of science that develops products by utilizing biological systems, living creatures, or elements out of them. It encompasses a wide range of fields such as biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. Countries like China, Japan, and India have taken favorable initiatives in the field of biotechnology in the past few years. Globally, the government activities are aimed at streamlining the medication regulatory pathway, standardizing clinical studies, and expediting the product approval processes. In light of these favorable trends, the industry has explosive growth potential. According to a recent report, the global biotechnology market size is expected to reach $4 trillion by 2030. The analysts are predicting a compound annual growth rate of close to 14% over the forecast period. Biotechnology startups are acquiring robust funding support and venture capital investments, which, in 2021, amounted to $41 billion, an increase of over 11% as compared to the $36.7 billion raised in the previous year. Organic factors are driving this growth as well. For example, the British Journal of Cancer predicts that the number of people suffering from cancer in the UK is expected to increase from 2.5 million in 2015 to 4 million by 2030. Per the journal, this would increase the demand for robust and advanced treatment methods for dealing with cancer. The money flowing towards research and development of vaccines has also increased in the past few years, largely as a result of the global panic during the COVID-19 crisis. Story continuesSome exciting trends that investors should keep in mind when considering the biotech sector are the advancements being made in relation to the treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. For example, aducanumab, developed by Biogen, is one such candidate. Personalized medicine is also likely to be a strong focus of biotech firms throughout 2022. Furthermore, with the improvements in biotech, the nanobiotechnology segment is expanding at an annual rate of 15% from 2022 to 2030. Even as investments in the biotech space witness a gradual slowdown due to the shift in focus away from medtech towards other sectors in light of a waning pandemic, the fundamentals of the sector remain robust and the biotechnology sphere remains a key driver of innovation and growth in the economy. A recent Endpoint survey revealed that 66% of investors think that biotech will outperform the broader market in 2022. Nearly 58% plan to increase their exposure to the sector this year in anticipation of this growth. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the biotechnology sector and have upcoming products or services with explosive growth potential were selected for the list. The business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed to provide readers with some additional insight for their investment decisions.

Shares have been volatile this year amid a binding arbitration with Johnson &amp; Johnson to decide key aspects of royalty payments related to nextgeneration multiple myeloma drug, Darzalex FASPROTM. Last quarter, we indicated share weakness in February and early March seemed to overstate the potential negative outcome, especially relative to the additional growth opportunities within Genmab’s promising R&amp;D pipeline. That potential was on display in Q2 when the company reported positive data for its bispecific antibody Epcoritamab, a new drug being developed with AbbVie to treat lymphoma. Bispecific antibodies are recombinant antibodies aimed at two biological targets simultaneously and are an important emerging technology area. The company expects to report further clinical trial updates later this year for another bispecific antibody it has developed with partner BioNTech. This new drug is expected to treat patients with metastatic or unresectable malignant solid tumors who are not candidates for standard therapy. We believe Genmab is establishing itself as one of the clear leaders in bispecifics, which increases our optimism about the long-term value of the company’s R&amp;D platform.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biotech Stocks With The Biggest Upside. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

For the year through November, the CPI increased 7.1%, marking the smallest increase since December 2021.The lower inflation print isn’t likely to alter the Fed’s monetary policy decision expected on Wednesday, though it will likely spark debate among members on how much further to increase rates until reaching a peak.“Overall, a smaller 50 bp hike is expected for the Fed’s meeting tomorrow, to be followed by another 50 bp over the first quarter next year before the Fed feels comfortable to pause the current cycle and reassess,” RBC said.Expectations that the Fed could pause sooner rather than later pushed Treasury yields sharply lower, sparking a Meta-led surge in big tech.Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) gained more than 4% after Goldman Sachs flagged the social media giant as a ""top pick"", saying most of the bad news about the firm’s core social media business and concerns about its hefty investments in the metaverse is increasingly priced into the shares.Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose 2%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended in the green, with the latter up more than 1%.Energy added to gains from a day earlier as oil prices were driven higher by ongoing supply constraints amid the closure of the Keystone pipeline supplying Canadian heavy crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast of Mexico.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) rallied more than 7%, while APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) and Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) were up about 4% each.Story continuesIn health care, meanwhile, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 20% after the drugmaker announced positive results from its experimental skin cancer treatment.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), meanwhile, closed up nearly 2% as Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on the stock to buy from neutral on expectations the firm's RSV, migraine, and sickle-cell disease drugs will drive growth in 2023.The move higher in the broader market comes as some continue to warn of a downturn next year, driven by a deterioration in corporate earnings as margins come under pressure from a weaker consumer amid the impact of higher interest rates.“As earnings projections deteriorate and the lagged effects of Fed’s actions begin to set in a more concrete way, I think markets will turn down,” Phillip Toews, CEO&amp;portfolio manager of Toews Asset Management, told Investing.com’s Yasin Ebrahim in an interview on Monday.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow cuts gains but ends higher as Fed comes into focusDanske Bank pleads guilty to resolve long-running Estonia money-laundering probeAfter-hours movers: ABM, Braze fall following earnings]"

BL currently has a PEG ratio of 8.98.Another notable valuation metric for PYPL is its P/B ratio of 4.15. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BL has a P/B of 53.13.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PYPL's Value grade of B and BL's Value grade of D.Both PYPL and BL are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PYPL is the superior value option right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In 2021 alone, nearly 2.8 million people filed fraud complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, CNBC reported. That was up 70% from the previous year and a new annual record.See: 9 Costco Brand Items That Aren’t Worth the MoneyFind: 3 Easy Tips to Turn Your Credit Woes into WowsIf recent trends are any indication, the fraud numbers will be similarly grim when the 2022 figures come in. A new report from data analysis and background check company BeenVerified found a spike in scams involving Facebook Marketplace and P2P cash transfer apps such as Zelle and PayPal over the past year. There has also been a big increase in crypto and romance scammers who use WhatsApp.The BeenVerified report was released last month and was based on an analysis of more than 165,000 scam calls and texts reported over the past three years. It found that the profusion of scam angles in 2022 “dwarf the years that preceded the pandemic.”  Among the highlights:The number of reported Facebook Marketplace scams grew 184.8% over the past year. These included numerous cases where sellers reported losing products to scammers who sent fake checks or other bogus cash “payments” as well as buyers who sent money but never received the product.User complaints related to Zelle scams grew 86% during the past year. One of the top Zelle scam formats involved fraudsters who put fake rental listings on the web and collected money for rentals that don’t exist. There was also a rise in pet scams following the same pattern.PayPal-related scams grew 31.8% this past year, often involving cash payments for products that were never sent.Scams involving WhatsApp rose 32.1% over the past year, partly because the app has become a gateway for romance and sextortion scams as well as for fake cryptocurrency investment opportunities.Story continuesOne problem is that many consumers might have a “false sense of security” about P2P platforms, said Robert Lowry, VP of security at BeenVerified — especially regarding Zelle, which is run by a company jointly owned by Bank of America, Truist, PNC, US Bancorp, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Capital One.“The move from the banks that own Zelle to reimburse victims of fraud is one that speaks to the rapidly shifting landscape of peer-to-peer payment solutions,” Lowry told GOBankingRates in an email statement. “It’s a good sign for consumers using these apps that all banks may move to protect these types of payments as they do for traditional banking transactions when someone is a victim of fraud.”To avoid becoming victims of fraud, consumers should “thoroughly vet” the people they send money to over P2P platforms, Lowry added.Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?More: Top 10 Richest People in the WorldHere are some recommendations to guard yourself against fraudulent phone calls, texts or emails:Don’t respond to messages.

If you want to read about some more low float stocks with high volume, go directly to 5 Low Float Stocks With High Volume.The US economy has had a turbulent year even though employment growth remains strong and many measures of economic activity register robust growth, even if more slowly than last year. Oil and food prices have been falling at the wholesale level. The major concern is inflation, and the interest rate hikes that have accompanied it. The monetary policy tightening has raised the cost of capital for companies and has slowed down earnings growth momentum throughout 2022, partly the reason the stock market has been such a challenge for investors in 2022.However, it seems that better days are ahead. The S&amp;P 500 racked up its second consecutive month of gains in November, as investors became ever more positive that the Federal Reserve would deliver a smaller rate hike in December. The index gained 5.4% in the last month, including a 3% rally in the final days. However, investors should proceed with caution given that the federal funds rate has gone up to 3.75%-4% so far this year, with another 0.5% rate hike expected to come in December.  Typically, analysts predict the S&amp;P 500 climbing by about 10% in 2023, which is in line with historical averages. However, some of the analysts are more cautious, expecting that the S&amp;P 500 will end lower at the end of 2023 than where it was at the end of 2022. Further, most Wall Street firms expect the US economy to go into recession in 2023, as a few others believe that the downward revisions mean lots of volatility for stocks in the early part of 2023. Investors should thus expect volatility in the first half of 2023, to be followed by an easier second half.In this overall context, it might be prudent to invest in stable growth firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), but at the same time, consider investments in low float, high volume stocks that might provide better short-term returns. According to a recent Bloomberg report, a recession in the US economy is effectively certain in the next 12 months. Bloomberg economists forecast a higher recession probability across all timeframes. Story continuesThe 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 has hit 100%. Economists predicted the likelihood of a recession within 11 months at 73%, up from 30%, and the 10-month probability has risen to 25% from 0%. Moreover, according to another research, economists predict a recession in the US beginning in early 2023 and lasting through at least the third quarter of the year. The central bank is likely to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023 to bring inflation under control. Therefore, the US economy is not going to be able to see a sustained expansion continue into 2023. The stock market is likely to struggle as a result. This means that investors should proceed with caution and allocate resources accordingly. For example, investments in firms with low float and high volumes might offer a better risk/reward ratio than investing in prominent growth names. This will also limit the amount of money allocated towards growth stocks that can be put to better use in value options. Our MethodologyThe companies that have low float and high volume were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices.

To skip our detailed analysis of the nanotechnology sector in 2022 and the future of nanotech, go directly and see 5 Best Nanotechnology Stocks to Buy Now.Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a close-to atomic scale to develop new structures, materials, and devices. Developed in the late 1980s, nanotechnology has since transformed numerous industries like medicine, consumer products, energy, materials and manufacturing. The concept is best explained by Chad Mirkin, a Northwestern University's professor of chemistry and materials science:“Everything, when miniaturized to the sub-100-nanometer scale, has new properties, regardless of what it is. This is what makes nanoparticles the materials of the future. They have strange chemical and physical properties compared to their larger-particle kin. The thing that matters about nanoparticles is their scale. The smaller you go, the ratio of surface to bulk atoms goes up. At a larger scale, the atoms at the surface are relatively inconsequential. But at nanoscales, you could have a particle that is almost all surface. Those atoms begin to contribute very significantly to the overall properties of the material.”Photo by L N on UnsplashGlobal Nanotechnology Industry: An OutlookAmid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for nanotechnology was estimated to be around $54.2 billion in 2020. Since then, the figure has been revised to project an overall expected market worth of $126.8 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% over the analysis period 2020-2027. The market is highly diversified into multiple segments, one of them being Nano Materials. The Nano Materials segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13% to reach $107.4 billion by the end of the aforementioned analysis period. The segment currently accounts for a little more than 15% of the global nanotechnology market.According to recent reports, the countries dominating the global nanotechnology sector in 2022 are China, the United States, India, Iran, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. The United States accounts for more than 29.5% of the global market size while China accounts for 29.53%, making the latter the largest nanotechnology contributor in the world. China is expected to reach an estimated market size of $22.1 billion at the end of the analysis period. Among noteworthy geographic markets which are rapidly becoming players on the global stage are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at more than 11%, respectively, over the 2020-2027. Some of the largest players in the market today are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO).Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we looked at Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 920 elite hedge funds and identified some of the most popular stocks which use nanotechnology or produce products related to nanotechnology. Then, we picked 10 stocks with strong fundamentals, positive analyst ratings, or a favorable hedge fund sentiment.The stocks have been ranked based on the number of hedge funds which hold stakes in them, from lowest to highest.Best Nanotechnology Stocks to Buy Now10. VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO)Hedge Fund Holdings: 15Based in Plainview, New York, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) is a global capital equipment supplier which specializes in the design and manufacture of processing systems for different technologies. In 2017, the company acquired Cambridge Nanotech, an innovator in atomic layer deposition. In Q3 2022, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) posted an EPS of $0.45, beating estimates of $0.41 by $0.04. The company beat consensus expectations of $170.9 million, posting a Q3 2022 revenue of $171.9 million. Like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) is one of the best nanotechnology stocks to buy now.On November 15, Benchmark analyst Mark Miller lowered the price target on VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) to $25 from $35, keeping a Buy rating on the shares. According to the analyst, while there was significant upside in the company's Q3 2022 earnings when compared to Q2 2022, the tenuous macroeconomic climate is likely to catch up with the stock. However, the company sees strong demand in areas like advanced packaging and MOCVD, which the stock is well-leveraged to capitalize upon. In light of this, VEECO Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:VECO) remains significantly undervalued on the assumption of long-term revenue growth of more than 9%.9. PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG)Hedge Fund Holdings: 34Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is an American company and global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

(NYSE:PPG) to $128 from $130, keeping a Buy rating on the shares.

It has an impressive track record of delivering shareholder returns via share buybacks and dividend growth, recently declaring a $0.62 dividend in October. Due to this, the analyst reckons the stock is drastically mispriced with respect to its strong fundamentals and favorable potential.Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE:PPG) in their Q1 2022 investor letter:“While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.”8. IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM)Hedge Fund Holdings: 40Based in Armonk, New York, IBM Corp.

The global economy has been rattled by the Ukraine war, lingering supply chain troubles and a sweeping energy crisis in Europe. Aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation have kept investors on tenterhooks.Year to date, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have dropped 28.8% and 16.3%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also down 6.4%.Identifying stocks to add to the investment portfolio in such a highly volatile market scenario can be quite challenging.Nevertheless, few Dow stocks have bucked the general trend and have seen price appreciation in the year. Investors might consider adding these stocks, which have proven resilient compared to the Dow Jones index.Dow Jones equity index consists of 30 of the country’s most prominent and valuable companies or blue-chip companies. Adding blue chip stocks to one’s portfolio amid a volatile market scenario is mostly considered as a safe investment bet.Blue chip stocks are usually less volatile to market vagaries. These companies generally have a large market cap, solid cash flows, a healthy balance sheet and, in most cases, a stable dividend policy.Therefore, we bring you the top five stocks — Chevron Corporation CVX, Merck &amp; Co MRK, Amgen AMGN, The Travelers Companies, Inc TRV and International Business Machines Corporation IBM — that have fared relatively better than the Dow Jones Index this year for investment consideration.5 Stocks that Minimized Dow Jones LossesChevron: Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world and is the only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares of Chevron have risen 44.7% year to date, outperforming Dow Jones and the Zacks sub-industry’s 43.7% gain during the same period.Chevron is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. The energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, owing to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, the San Ramon, CA-based company had $15.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $23.6 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization of a modest 12.9%.Chevron's earnings and cash flows have been steadily improving, boosted by higher crude realizations and a recovery in consumption. Earlier in the year, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by 6% to $1.42 per share (or $5.68 per share annualized) and promised anything between $5 billion and $15 billion worth of buybacks each year. Chevron recorded $37.1 billion in cash flow from operations during the nine months ended Sep 30, surging from $19.7 billion a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by $1.12 to $19.17 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 135.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck &amp; Co: Merck &amp; Co boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. Merck’s shares have risen 42.2% this year so far compared with 12% gain by the sub-industry.Keytruda has played an important role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years. Keytruda sales are benefiting from healthy momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 1 cent to $7.38 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 22.6%.Amgen: Amgen is one of the prominent biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets.

In the last reported quarter, these drugs generated a combined $2 billion in sales with volume growth of 17%.New drugs Lumakras and Tezspire are off to an encouraging start. The acquisition of ChemoCentryx has added a strategic new growth asset to Amgen’s portfolio.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 20 cents to $17.66 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 3.3%.The Travelers Companies: The company, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide variety of property and casualty insurance and surety products and services to businesses, organizations and individuals in the United States and select international markets.Shares of Travelers have gained 19.6% outperforming the sub-industry’s increase of 5.1% in a year.Travelers boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth.

It anticpiates fixed income NII or net investment income, including earnings from short term securities, to be around $500 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter.Consistent efforts to return excess capital to shareholders through dividend hike and share buybacks bode well.

As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had $2.51 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations.IBM: IBM has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms.

Globally, AI has been integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations as well. As 5G deployment increases, the real-world uses of AI in automation, cloud, and large databases, are likely to drive the demand for the new technology even further, a prime example being the popularity of smart homes and smart cities. One of the most important parts of this growth is the chip industry. According to a report by the Business Research Company, the artificial intelligence chip market size is expected to grow from $10 billion in 2021 to $15 billion in 2022, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of more than 42%. Despite supply issues due to rising demand and the global geopolitical crisis, the AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49 billion in 2026. The use of AI in fields like food and beverage development is growing too. Another important market trend in the sector, evidenced by the focus of the biggest AI companies in the world like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), is the AI-enabled industrial robotics development. AI tools are being used on social media, for big data analytics, the Internet of things, and cloud computing. The integration of these digital technologies into corporate operations, more commonly referred to as digital transformation, is on the rise as well. Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for long-term investors.”14. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Market Capitalization: $30 Billion     Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine prompted management to warn in May of lower profits for the rest of the year. Behind the frustrations, however, were indications that the business outlook remained strong, as order volume continued to grow following price increases at the end of 2021. In the recent quarter, the company reported stronger results despite ongoing supply chain issues that hindered its ability to fulfil orders. To mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, Rockwell has been accumulating inventory and redesigning certain products. We believe Rockwell will see its revenues expand as its resilience improves and supply shortages recede.”13. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Market Capitalization: $40 Billion Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) offers internet search services in China. It operates through Baidu Core and iQIYI segments.

On December 6, Capital analyst Rob Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock and lowered the price target to $167 from $185, noting that another y/y decline in advertising revenue is anticipated in the fourth quarter before a return to growth in the first quarter and a 5% growth rate for 2023.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Ariel Investment is a leading shareholder in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) with 2.6 million shares worth more than $305.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Ariel Investment, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“China’s internet search and online community leader Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) also weighed on relative results in the quarter. Continuing macro headwinds driven by China’s Zero-Covid policy are resulting in sluggish advertising trends. Looking ahead, the company remains committed to sustainable, profitable growth as management works to improve overall operational efficiency, executing its strategic commitments around technological innovation and the transition to a green economy. We also continue to be enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”12. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Market Capitalization: $60 Billion   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology announced that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) mobile memory is continuing to gain market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies, an American multinational corporation, the latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. Micron’s mobile memory and storage solutions are built to fuel the next wave of 5G and AI-enabled smartphone experiences. Micron has created the world's fastest discrete graphics memory solution: GDDR6X. Launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce 3090 and GeForce 3080 GPUs, GDDR6X takes graphics to new levels of gaming realism and unleashes high-performance AI inference. Micron has been chasing maximum bandwidth memory to support gaming and professional visualization for a long time. It also includes how Micron has achieved staggering speeds with GDDR6X, the future of AI training with HBM2E, and other high-bandwidth products. On December 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it would not be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Market Capitalization: $90 Billion     General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. It operates through four segments: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare segments. On November 27, GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of General Electric, introduced SIGNA Experience. SIGNA is a new platform of four synergistic transformative technologies that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning in MRI scanning. On September 5, General Electric announced the launch of its first Made in India Optima IGS 320, an AI-powered Cath lab, to advance cardiac care in India. Optima IGS 320 was built at Wipro GE Healthcare’s new factory launched under the production-linked incentive scheme in Bengaluru. The Cath lab leverages the GE proprietary AutoRight technology. AutoRight is the first neural network-based interventional image chain. AutoRight features Artificial Intelligence that automatically optimizes image and dose parameters in real-time, which enables clinicians to focus their attention and expertise on patients. On December 5, Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase maintained a Buy rating on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock and raised the price target to $94 from $89, noting that the industrial economy can show unprecedented resilience, as the supply chain is only just beginning to heal, backlogs are extended, and order growth generally remains quite healthy.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Group is a leading shareholder in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) with 13.8 million shares worth more than $852 million.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Longleaf Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments has strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Market Capitalization: $118 Billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel AI announced that it has introduced FakeCatcher, a new real-time Deepfake Detector, that analyzes the Blood Flow in video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%.

Intel developed oneDNN to help companies optimize computer hardware such as CPUs and streamline the development of deep learning applications. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company announced a cost reduction plan, which should help but doesn’t help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Market Capitalization: $113 Billion     Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. On December 2, Advanced Micro Devices announced the expansion of its partnership with Viettel High Tech, a member of Viettel group, to exploit a 5G network field to serve the latter’s more than 130 million mobile customers globally.

With the latest release of the company’s ROCm 5.0, developers are equipped with turn-key AI framework containers on AMD Infinity Hub, improved tools, and streamlined installation, and can expect to experience reduced kernel launch times and faster application performance. On November 14, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $75, noting that the PC segment has been early in digesting inventory and been dragging down growth, but overall CPU shipments are annualizing to about 230MM units in fourth quarter, which is far below even the most bearish market forecasts for PCs in 2023.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.99 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), compared to 87 in the previous quarter worth $4.8 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more)8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Market Capitalization: $134 Billion  International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide.

On October 17, analyst David Grossman maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $140 from $150, noting that the company is defensive and likely impacted less than most large-cap tech, but not immune to slowing GDP growth.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)7. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Market Capitalization: $202 Billion Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs, manufactures and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, Japan, and China.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and lowered the price target to $52 from $54, noting that the upside from the fiscal first quarter beat is tempered by a more cautious view on a tougher macro backdrop in upcoming periods. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”6. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Market Capitalization: $219 Billion  Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide. On December 5, Twelve Labs Inc, the developer of a search platform that enables users to find moments of interest quickly in a video, partnered with Oracle Corp. to build an AI-powered model for the former. As part of the partnership, the startup will use infrastructure resources from Oracle’s cloud platform to support its AI development efforts.

The collaboration will bring Nvidia’s full accelerated computing stack from GPUs to systems to software to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OCI.  OCI will add tens of thousands more NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100, to its capacity. Oracle noted that, along with OCI’s AI cloud infrastructure of bare metal, cluster networking, and storage, enterprises will get a broad, accessible portfolio of options for AI training and deep learning.  On December 5, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained an Equal Weight rating on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock and raised the price target to $81 from $70, noting that the company’s exposure to back-office workflows and its smaller but hyper-growth OCI business make sales less susceptible to growing macro pressure than other software names.   Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) with 25.9 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the biggest AI companies in the world. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest AI Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

Beer, burritos and coffee according to Grubhub's sixth annual deep dive into its customers' food and drinking habits.The food delivery giant, a unit of Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), broke down the top orders by specific dishes, meal type (breakfast, lunch, and late-night), desserts, alcohol, coffee, and even dipping sauces.This year's winner: Burritos, in a bowl or the classic wrap.The burrito moved up from its 2021 eighth spot to the top pick as customers were keen on the ability to customize the handheld takeout item, Grubhub found. People ordered burritos a whopping 4 million times this year, and with all types of fillings, from sausage and eggs to guac and sour cream. In 2021, the Impossible Foods burger was the #1 choice but fell out of the Top 10 in 2022.The humble cheeseburger, meanwhile, took the number two spot, followed by cheese pizza, pad thai, chicken quesadillas, California rolls, fried chicken sandwiches, caesar salads, and chicken tikka masala. Boneless wings rounded out the Top 10.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Breakfast timeBreakfast orders across the U.S. ranked in the following order: sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches, donuts, sausage burritos, bagels with cream cheese, and then muffins. (In New York City, however, a bagel was the ultimate go-to breakfast order.)Denver took the No.1 spot from New York City, having the most early-bird breakfast orders, those placed between 5 a.m. ET and 8 a.m. ET.To go along with breakfast or for a quick pick-me-up throughout the day, Americans chose iced coffee, up from the No. 3 spot in 2021, ""regardless of the temperature outside,"" the report noted. Iced options were actually the four out of five top coffee orders. Hot coffee came in at No. 2, followed by iced caramel coffee, iced french vanilla, and frozen coffee.

Grubhub customers in Boston, a big college town, placed the most orders after 10 p.m., per the report. (Nationwide?

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the performance of the S&amp;P 500 so far this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks That Don't Pay Dividends.The Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) is a stock market index that tracks the stock performance of pretty much the 500 largest companies listed on the major stock exchanges in the US. The index was subject to poorer performance over the last 12 months in light of various problems such as the geopolitical issues caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflationary and recession concerns due to the Fed's aggressive rate hike stance, and the bursting of the tech bubble. However, stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 saw broader gains in November and some market strategists are optimistic about December as well. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was also quoted as saying that the central bank will now slow its rate-hiking campaign, easing pressures on the market.A few of the most famous names on the S&amp;P 500 include companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). These being in the tech sector have consistently been among the best-performing sector on the index over the last decade. Such stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 rise by about 5.4% at the close of November. The broader benchmark index ended up outperforming the smaller Nasdaq Composite index, which gained only 4.4% over the same period.While many major companies on the index are also strong dividend payers, it is not a requisite condition for a company to be a dividend-payer for it to be an attractive investment choice. Many companies may choose to reinvest their proceeds from ongoing operations into their business models to retain their strong financial performance instead of paying out the same money to their shareholders. This opens larger avenues for a company's individual growth in the long run.Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks that don't pay dividends, to recommend attractive stock picks for investors looking to invest in solid companies with long-term growth potential. Our rankings reflect the consensus opinion of 900+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.Photo by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 15 best S&amp;P 500 stocks that don't pay dividends.Our MethodologyWe have selected the best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks for our list below.

While revenue and profits are protected by patents, their future revenue depends on how quickly their drugs are copied once they fall off patent and the success of their R&amp;D. Both are unpredictable.Instead, we prefer to invest in companies that sell testing equipment and related consumables to the industry. Waters, for example, is a share that we have watched for years and would like to invest in at the right price. The company’s instruments are critical to the production and development of drugs and are the gold standard in the industry. Furthermore, they are often included in the patent applications of customers. This trust and reputation take years to build, resulting in high profit margins. At the same time, it also means that even when a drug of their customer falls off patent, the manufacturers of the generic version are likely to continue using the same instruments as these were already approved in the original application. So, the company’s revenues and profits are less dependent on patent cliffs or the success of R&amp;D than those of pharmaceutical companies.”11. Synopsys, Inc.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends AES (AES) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this power company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for AES is 6.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 6.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.5%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for AES is 6.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 6.1%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 6.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for AES have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.9% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made AES a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions AES well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares fell another 1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday, and the company's ticker page remains among the most visited on Yahoo Finance.""The decline is likely in response to the CPI [Consumer Price Index] report that showed U.S. air fares fell 3% from October to November,"" CFRA analyst Colin Scarola wrote in a note moments after the latest CPI reading. ""However, the CPI air fare data has not historically been representative of UAL's pricing trends. For example, the CPI data showed U.S. air fares fell 8% from Q2 to Q3, but UAL's actual pricing was down just 1% Q/Q in Q3. Further, some moderation in air fares is to be expected given how much fuel prices have fallen recently, allowing airlines to charge less while increasing profitability. Notably, UAL forecasts a $3.61 average fuel price for Q4, but as of today, jet fuel prices are under $2.70 (-25% vs. forecast).""Rival airlines such as Delta, Jetblue, and Southwest also saw large losses on Tuesday.Scarola added that the sell-off was overdone and reiterated a Buy rating on United's stock. Her also raised his earnings estimates on United for 2022, 2023, and 2024 and took the price target to $60 from $59.The move in United's stock occurred as the airline made a big play toward improving profitability over the next decade.Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal speaks during a joint press event with United Airlines at the Boeing manufacturing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, on December 13, 2022.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pinnacle West Capital. View our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pinnacle West Capital?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Pinnacle West Capital already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Pinnacle West Capital's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Pinnacle West Capital. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 8.0% of the stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 8 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Pinnacle West CapitalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Pinnacle West Capital Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$23m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Pinnacle West Capital. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Pinnacle West Capital (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the clothing fashion industry and go directly to 5 Most Well-Known Clothing Brands in the World.Clothing Industry: An AnalysisThe global clothing industry grew from $551 billion in the year 2021 to $606 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 9.9%. However, the pandemic after effects, rate hikes and supply-chain disruptions due to the ongoing Ukraine war are expected to slash the apparel industry CAGR by 3.8% and the market is projected to reach a share of $768.26 billion in 2026 at the CAGR of 6.1%. McKinsey opines that the luxury market is likely to outperform the rest of the apparel industry since wealthy shoppers’ shopping patterns are largely unaffected by market downturns. They forecast a growth rate for luxury fashion to be 5 to 10% in the US in 2023. As for the masses, the Consumer Pulse survey found that more US-based consumers have switched brands to find lower prices than at any other time since the pandemic. Of those that switched, more than a third went for private-label products and the 90% of them stated that they intend to incorporate this behavior into their routines.TrendsThe luxury clothing industry has been the strongest performer in the larger apparel market, with a 33% shareholder return relative to 9% in the value segment. However, athleisure-wear is fast rising in popularity among regular as well as luxury customers. Athleisure market generated a growth of about 20.3% from 2019-2021, as people worked from home and switched to a more casual and sports wardrobe during lockdowns.

On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the My Intuitive app community continued to increase on a year-over-year basis.The My Intuitive app is currently available in several countries, including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K. and Ireland and Switzerland, with more launches for the upcoming quarters. The app enables surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical’s Ion system is also experiencing strong uptake as the installed base increased to approximately 254 systems in the third quarter compared with the installed base of approximately 98 systems in the year-ago period. The system expands the company’s service beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures.Intuitive Surgical’s teams in Israel and the United States have developed the Intuitive Hub with its Orpheus technology. Intuitive Hub — a unified hardware and software solution for the operating room — allows OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and partner virtually by utilizing existing workflows and intuitive systems.The Intuitive Hub grew 21% from the third quarter of last year. Moreover, software updates to the Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence.The FDA clearance earlier this year for integrating mobile cone-beam CT imaging technology with its minimally-invasive, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy system, Ion Endoluminal System, is likely to benefit ISRG. The technology will allow the biopsy of small and difficult-to-access lesions in the lung and the biopsy of the peripheral lung and provide the necessary stability for precision in a biopsy.In the third quarter of 2022, outside the United States, revenues totaled $474.4 million, up 5.2% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by substantial growth in the procedure volume. Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 in the prior-year quarter. Of these, 54 were in Europe, 32 in Japan and 17 in China.Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical’s gross margin and adjusted operating margin improved year over year in the third quarter. The expansion in the gross and operating margins buoys optimism. The company now expects its pro-forma operating expense to grow 21%-23%, lower than the previous guidance of 23%-25%.The company also expects operating expenses to decline in 2023. A decrease in the expense guidance amid macro headwinds like inflation buoys optimism for the stock. However, intense competition in the global MedTech space remains a concern.What’s Weighing on ISRG?The pandemic adversely impacted the global supply of semiconductors and other materials utilized in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company has been undertaking efforts to secure the supply required to fulfill consumer demand, global shortages might result in higher output costs or a delay in production.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The list recognizes companies that support family caregivers and also raises awareness of how businesses help make caregiving and professional success compatible.“Many companies have programs in place to help workers who are parents, but equally important is supporting workers with parents – the working daughters and sons who care for aging and/or ill family members,” said Working Daughter founder Liz O’Donnell. “We looked for companies that went beyond offering flex time and EAP services. Inclusion on the list sends a strong message that a company understands and supports its employee caregivers.”More than 1 in 6 working Americans assist with the care of a family member, relative, or friend who is elderly or has a disability. Often, these caregiving roles fall to working women who go on to encounter professional difficulties, switch to less demanding jobs, take time off, or even quit working altogether because of their dual roles.“Navient is proud to support working caregivers with benefits such as dependent care assistance, employee resource groups, and mental health and wellbeing programs,” said Mike Smith, Navient’s chief human resources officer. “The stresses working adults are under to care for families of all kinds can be immense, which is why we do everything we can to help our team work at its very best by offering a supportive culture and benefits.”About NavientNavient (Nasdaq: NAVI) provides technology-enabled education finance and business processing solutions that simplify complex programs and help millions of people achieve success.

In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$516k worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for CSX CSX Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Chairman, John Zillmer, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$516k worth of shares at a price of US$32.25 each. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$32.74, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 4.8% of John Zillmer's stake. The only individual insider seller over the last year was John Zillmer.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does CSX Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.08% of CSX shares, worth about US$59m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About CSX Insiders?The fact that there have been no CSX insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Our analysis of CSX insider transactions leaves us cautious. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with CSX and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Under the long-established policies, workers are penalized with points for unscheduled absences, and risk being suspended or fired.The scheme came under fire during the pandemic, when industry-wide job cuts meant to bolster profits left fewer workers to manage the COVID-related cargo surge.Rail unions are protesting the lack of federal intervention on sick-time policies outside the U.S. Capitol and in cities around the country on Tuesday.On Dec. 2, U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation that broke the impasse that could have halted shipments of food, fuel and medicine, stranded commuters and harmed the U.S. economy without making any changes to sick-time agreements.When the pandemic struck and freight volumes surged, affected rail workers said those policies discouraged them from seeking medical care or taking time off to recover from illness.Under the new policy effective Jan. 1, CSX said on Tuesday it will no longer assess points when an employee calls in sick shortly before a scheduled workday with an illness for which they saw a doctor.CSX's new attendance rules will be ""non-disciplinary and non-punitive,"" the company said in an email to Reuters.Four of 12 unions involved in the latest railroad contract talks rejected a recently negotiated deal because it did not include any paid short-term sick days and failed to address the attendance points system used by CSX and the two largest U.S. railroads: Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF.Under the new CSX policy, accrued points will expire on a rolling 12-month cycle rather than accumulate indefinitely, and employees will receive credit for working without an absence and can use those to expunge points.

This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc. While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that valuations are supportive.  Our current picks are Analog Devices, MACOM Technology and Microchip.About The IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Major Trends Driving the IndustryMost companies in this industry are positioned for strong growth this year followed by difficult comps and weaker demand in the next. It is the net effect of these companies being still somewhat behind schedule in delivering to the post-pandemic rush in demand. This in turn is because of supply chain disruption (which continues for most), driven by the pandemic, geopolitical tensions and the more recent COVID shutdowns in China. Supply constraints also impact profitability as it may be necessary to idle capacity despite demand being out there. Going into 2023, some segments are seeing orders slow down or get rescheduled, which along with the slight uptick in cancellations, points to increasing caution at customers. But many of these companies have long term agreements stretching well into 2023, which means that any softness could take longer to show up in the results.Story continues The increasing use of electronics in vehicles, airplanes and defense equipment; increased factory automation; greater penetration of smartphones, tablets, notebooks, PCs and all manner of personal computing and other personal devices and smart household appliances; communications infrastructure moving to 5G; greater reliance on cloud infrastructure; the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), more advanced medical devices, EVs, self-driving cars etc continue to expand the addressable market for semiconductor chips. The constantly expanding addressable market makes this a very attractive industry for long-term investment. This is particularly true because the industry is capacity constrained based on today’s level of digitization, but this digitization is expected to increase manifold over the next decade because of the adoption of AI, EV and other emerging technologies. Additionally, the breadth of  markets and applications ensure that even if some segments (like consumer/computing) see demand pullbacks, emerging areas like AI, EV, IoT, etc. balance them out.    The post-pandemic hybrid model, where more people move out of their homes more often but not all the time, is leading to an expansion of the overall electronic footprint of the consumer/computing segment. Near-term challenges here are related to strong uptake in the last couple of years. But there are other opportunities, including the metaverse and consumer devices incorporating newer technologies to enable more experiences. The number of semiconductors per device and their complexities also continue to increase, thus supporting demand. The adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, is another boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology enables in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials are increasing. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it is not totally replacing 4G but supplementing it, thus adding to component demand. Industry consolidation is important because the cost and complications of making chips rises in an environment where the adoption of semiconductors in devices of varying value requires prices to decline. Acquisitions are also driven by the need to expand R&amp;D capabilities and to acquire key talent.                              U.S. government officials worry that none of the most advanced chips are currently manufactured in the country. This is considered to be a national security concern given that semiconductors are playing an increasingly larger role in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. How exactly this situation will play out for the industry is unknown. Increasing capacity would depress prices. And U.S. production would increase cost. So much depends on the government’s contribution (perhaps through the CHIPS Act). In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain ProspectsThe Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technologysector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #187, which places it in the bottom 25% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates uncertain near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.However, despite the industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries, the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate, is positive. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year. it appears that analyst opinion has significantly improved: 2022 estimates have risen 26.9% over the past year, while 2023 estimates have risen 2.9%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance Is AttractiveSince April, the Zacks Semiconductor – Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It has however traded at a slight discount to the S&amp;P 500 though much of this period.Overall, the industry lost 13.6% of its value over the past year while the broader sector lost 33.2% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 17.0%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 16.96X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500’s 17.72X and the broader computer and technology sector’s 20.67X. At the current level, it is also trading below its median level of 16.96X over the past year.The industry has traded between its lowest point of 13.80X and highest point of 24.11X over the past year.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Stocks To Hold for the Long-TermMicrochip Technology Incorporated MCHP: Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity, and wireless connectivity applications.Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where the company is seeing supply constraints. This is also stretching out lead times and forcing the company to idle capacity, which hurts its profitability. Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently bought back a substantial number of shares and earlier this year, the board announced a 37.8% increase in the dividend.Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders. Microchip beat estimates by 1.4% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has increased 24 cents (4.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2023 estimate increased 6 cents (1.0%) during the same period.#2 (Buy) ranked Microchip’s shares are down 11.5% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MCHP Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI: Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Management is optimistic about near-term strength based on stabilizing orders, a strong backlog and continued design win momentum. Additionally, the increased scale and diversification, flexibility of its manufacturing model, and strengthening brand value are expected to help it navigate the economic downturn. This strength has allowed it to generate all-time high fourth-quarter revenues in the industrial, automotive and communications markets, as well as relatively modest growth in consumer.

Behind its quiet facade lies a warren of workshops where modern machines melt metals and thump out money.""At the moment, every gold coin that comes off the coining press has already been sold,"" said Starsich. ""Right now we could sell three times as many as we are able to produce.""The Mint's shop, a modern corner of the building, has had a long queue outside daily for months. Among those standing in line was pensioner Renate, one of the few willing to talk about her purchasing habits.""I'm from an older generation. Whenever things get a bit uncertain we come back to gold coins and tell ourselves we'll always be able to sell them,"" she said. ""Gold has that safety factor.""Starsich said customers were of all ages and from all walks of life. Around a third of the Mint's sales are to foreign buyers.The Mint was founded in 1194 to strike coins from the silver paid as a ransom for Richard the Lionheart, after he had been seized and held captive by enemies near Vienna.Today, the Mint says its one-ounce Philharmonic gold coin, named after the world famous Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, is the top-selling gold bullion coin in Europe and Japan.HOARDERSAustria is a financially conservative country in which the public hoards cash and gold in times of crisis. The Mint says demand for gold is the highest it has been since it took on its current form in 1989.The Austrian National Bank, which owns the Mint, said in a presentation on Austrian households' finances in October that more gold had been bought in the two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic started than in the five years before that.Story continuesIt noted demand for gold in the first half of this year was higher even than in the first half of 2020, ""despite rising prices"", suggesting a rush to an asset seen as a safe haven.""It's a cascade,"" Starsich said of the causes. ""It started with the corona crisis, with the pandemic, when people were unsettled. Then in February Russia invaded Ukraine. That boosted sales again. And then the rising inflation over the summer/autumn, which increased sales further slightly.""This year at the end of November the Mint had sold more than 1.8 million ounces of gold and was approaching the record of more than 2 million set in 2009 after the global financial crisis. Sales in December are usually strong as gold is a traditional Christmas gift.Starsich added that the rush to gold was a global phenomenon seen at other major national mints. The gold price is currently around $1,800 an ounce, short of its peaks above $2,000 in March of this year and August 2020.He said he believed more Austrians were seeking to include gold in their portfolios as a hedge against stocks or to diversify their portfolios. Many analysts doubt the usefulness of gold to counter inflation, however.(Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)]"

That day, a nurse said, 42 other children had already been checked into the emergency unit, ravaged by hunger. There were 57 the day before that.Staff at the Benadir maternity and paediatric hospital said admissions of malnourished children have more than doubled their patient numbers over the past year. They are now treating over 1,000 emergency cases each month.Half a million children's lives are at risk from a looming famine in Somalia, according to the United Nations – that's more than in any country worldwide this century.Across Africa, from east to west, people are experiencing a food crisis that is bigger and more complex than the continent has ever seen, say diplomats and humanitarian workers.One in five Africans – a record 278 million people – were already facing hunger in 2021, according to data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It says the situation has worsened.The number of East Africans experiencing acute food insecurity – when a lack of food puts lives or livelihoods in immediate danger – has spiked by 60% in just the last year, and by nearly 40% in West Africa, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).Conflict and climate change are the long-term causes. Heavy debt burdens following the COVID-19 pandemic, rising prices and war in Ukraine have made things much worse as European aid has been sucked away, data and testimony from more than a dozen experts, donors, diplomats, medical staff and men and women in farms and marketplaces across nearly a dozen countries in Africa and beyond shows.Benadir Hospital is coping, said Dr. Aweis Olow, head of its paediatric department. But referrals from other clinics are accelerating: ""Without a lot of help from the rest of the world, the situation will be out of control.""Story continuesHere, alongside Isak's story, are five reasons Africa is suffering from the worst food crisis ever recorded:1. CLIMATE CHANGEEast Africa has missed four consecutive rainy seasons, the worst drought in 40 years, Michael Dunford, the WFP's East Africa director said.""The situation has never been as bad from a regional perspective as it is today,"" he told Reuters.African countries account for only around 3% of the global emissions responsible for climate change, but suffer more than any other region from its impact.Of the 20 nations ranked as most vulnerable to climate change, all but four are African, according to the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which measures countries' vulnerability.Some 22 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia face high levels of acute food insecurity due solely to the drought, a number projected to rise to up to 26 million by February if the rains again fail, the WFP said.The lack of rainfall has caused crops to fail. In northern Kenya, pastoralists dig deeper and deeper in search of water for their livestock. Traditional Maasai herders, whose culture revolves around their cows, face the choice of selling them or watching them die.On the other side of the continent, parts of West Africa have been hit by flooding after the most intense rainfall in 30 years. By mid-October, 5 million people and 1 million hectares of farmland were affected, according to the WFP.In Chad, over 19,000 head of livestock were swept away after rivers broke their banks, and in neighbouring Nigeria, flooding has hit 29 of the 36 states.In October in Benue state, part of Nigeria's agricultural heartland, farmer Abraham Hon looked out over water stretching to the horizon, covering some 20 hectares of his ruined rice fields.""You have drought in some places, then you have floods in some places,"" he said. ""That is a real shift.""""SAVING OUR CHILDREN""Isak's hometown, Dinsoor, is about 370 km (230 miles) from the capital in Somalia's Bay region. In June, she and her husband and children set out on foot, hoping to escape drought. The journey to Mogadishu took 12 days.They brought their savings of around $15, and some milk and food.They walked. ""We fled in the hope of saving our children,"" she said, seated on a hospital bed with her two girls – Nasib, 4, and Fardawsa, 3 – and an infant on her back.A day into the journey, they were ambushed by bandits. The robbers took their money and food, but spared their lives. They kept walking. A stranger gave the children a lift on his donkey cart.After four days they reached the regional capital, Baidoa, but couldn't find help there. Someone gave them a lift to Mogadishu. There, they found a spot on government land and built a shelter with other displaced people.Mohamud Abdi Ahmed, an official for the Garasbaley district where the family set up camp, said there were 50,000 displaced families there.""Sometimes it's difficult to count them, because more arrive every minute.""2: CONFLICT IN AFRICAConflict has long been a driver of hunger. War forces civilians from their homes, livelihoods, farms and food sources. It also makes it dangerous to deliver assistance.The number of displaced people in Africa has tripled over the past decade to a record 36 million in 2022, according to U.N. data. That represents almost half the displaced people in the world. Most were displaced internally within their own countries by conflict.Conflicts are worsening across the continent, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED), a crisis monitoring group.In 2016, it recorded 3,682 ""battles"" between armed groups in Africa. There were 7,418 in 2021.Isak's country, Somalia, has been unstable since a civil war in the early 1990s and today is a patchwork of clan strongholds, government-controlled areas and zones in the grip of al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group fighting to impose its own rule based on a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.A U.S. non-profit, Fund for Peace, ranks global states by how fragile they are. In 2022, 15 African nations occupied the top 20 slots of its rankings.SUFFOCATIONWhenever Isak had food, her youngest children were given top priority.""The children were getting weaker for months,"" she said. She and other mothers say malnourished children swell up and their skin thins. They bruise easily.Just a week after the family arrived in Mogadishu in June, two of Isak's daughters - 6-year-old Muna and 7-year-old Hamdi - fell ill one after another.They were weak and ran fevers, their legs bowed and limbs swelled. They began to cough and struggled to breathe.People who don't get enough minerals or vitamins can develop iron-deficiency anaemia, which means they do not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to tissues throughout the body.So as children starve, their bodies slowly suffocate.Dr Olow said such cases are becoming commonplace. Children arriving at Benadir Hospital receive oxygen, emergency feeding and, if needed, blood transfusions. Just 3% die, Olow said.By the time Isak brought Muna and Hamdi for treatment, it was too late.""The doctors could not help them, because they were about to die when we reached the hospital,"" Isak said.3. CONFLICT IN EUROPERussia's invasion of Ukraine in February, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,"" added to Africa's problems.The crisis distracted wealthy governments' humanitarian agencies for the first half of this year, said a senior Western government official involved in humanitarian response in Africa, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.""When Ukraine happened, it sucked all the oxygen out of the room,"" he said.As the food crisis deepened earlier this year, the African Development Bank set up an emergency food production fund of $1.5 billion aimed at helping African farmers produce 38 million tonnes of wheat, corn, rice and soybeans.But needs across Africa's crises have risen by 13% over the past year alone, the data shows. While total donor funding over that time has increased 12%, it currently meets just half of requirements.European countries in particular have cut aid in Africa. European governments contributed 21% of humanitarian relief aid to African countries in 2022, down 16 percentage points since 2018.Some countries – such as the United States – have since boosted humanitarian assistance budgets, but the shortfalls remain, a Reuters analysis of U.N. data shows.Four of the five African countries receiving the most humanitarian funding under the 2022 aid appeal are located in or border the drought-stricken Horn of Africa region.That's leading to some tough choices.The WFP has, in some cases, been forced to reduce rations, said Ollo Sib, a senior researcher for the agency in West Africa.""We can keep people alive, but we don't just want to keep people alive,"" he said.Chad, for example, currently hosts 577,000 refugees from other countries – the largest group in West Africa. Since 2020, conflict there has also more than doubled the number of internally displaced Chadians to around 381,000.Faced with overwhelming needs, the WFP has already begun reducing rations for some refugees. And it told Reuters that, without more funding soon, it could be forced to suspend food assistance for all but the 10% of refugees considered the most vulnerable.Moscow's Ukraine campaign also throttled grain exports.The U.N. and Turkey brokered a deal in July to unblock three Black Sea ports. Under that initiative, 615 vessels left Ukrainian ports between Aug. 1 and Dec. 13 carrying over 13.8 million tonnes of corn, wheat, rapeseed and sunflower oil.Just 11 ships were destined for sub-Saharan Africa, however.""It's making a contribution. But there is no silver bullet,"" said the WFP's Dunford.Disruptions caused by that war have also provoked a fertiliser shortage. Where stocks are available, prices have risen beyond the means of many farmers. The result will be smaller harvests next year: In West Africa, the WFP estimates cereal production could fall 20%.""THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE DEAD""The Benadir hospital can't always help.""Sometimes mothers bring us dead children,"" said Farhia Moahmud Jama, head nurse at the paediatric emergency unit. ""And they don't know they're dead.""Weakened by hunger, camp residents are vulnerable to disease and people are dying due to a lack of food, said Nadifa Hussein Mohamed, who managed the camp where Isak's family initially stayed.""Maybe the whole world is hungry and donors are bankrupt, I don't know,"" she said. ""But we're calling out for help, and we do not see relief.""Isak and her husband said some nights, armed men threaten and beat the residents: ""They want to sell the land.""Ahmed, the district official, said security around the camps was tight.4. DEBTCOVID-19 left Africa facing the strongest economic headwinds in years, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).After years of borrowing, countries are struggling to service their debts. According to the IMF, 19 of sub-Saharan Africa's 35 low-income countries are in debt distress – where a government is unable to fulfil its financial obligations and debt restructuring is required – or at high risk of it.Ghana is an example. The country of 32 million people owed 476 billion cedis – or around $42 billion in September – over $1,300 per person. In July, the government turned to the IMF for relief. In December, Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said debt had topped 100% of Ghana's Gross Domestic Product.Ghana's currency, the cedi, is Africa's weakest. At its lowest level this year, in November, it sank by 59% against the dollar, straining the country's ability to pay for imports. Shopkeepers shut their doors temporarily in October in protest.In October, Ghana's inflation rate hit a new 21-year high of 40.4%, driven in large part by higher food costs. Cereal prices have gone up over 51%. Dairy and eggs by nearly 59%.Globally, prices of cereals, dairy, meat, vegetable oils and sugar climbed over 23% in 2021, the fastest in more than a decade, according to an index from the FAO.Food expenses constitute 40% of households' consumer spending in sub-Saharan Africa – the highest share in the world, according to the IMF.For Ghanaian Evelyn Lartey, a trip to market in the capital Accra has become a race.""The maths you use one day expires the next, and you don't know what are the real prices,"" she said. ""You just have to pay what you're told or else keep walking.""HEART PAINOn Wednesday Oct. 19, months after Muna and Hamdi's deaths, two of Isak's other daughters – Nasib and Fardawsa – could not sleep.""They were complaining of heart pain. It was 2 a.m.,"" she said.They set off for the hospital. There were few vehicles on the road, and none stopped when they tried to wave them down, so Isak and her husband carried the children for four km.A normal three-year-old child has between 11 and 13.7 grams of haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein that carries oxygen around the body, per decilitre of blood.Doctors told Isak that Fardawsa's blood contained 1 gram of haemoglobin per decilitre. She needed a blood transfusion.The medics couldn't find a vein on her hands, so they transfused the blood through a vein in her head.""It's not yet her time to die,"" her mother said, relieved.5. GOVERNMENTSAfrican governments have done little to prevent food crises from recurring.In a move to boost production, reduce import reliance and improve food security, leaders in 2003 pledged to commit at least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture and rural development within five years.By 2021, nearly two decades later, just two countries in sub-Saharan Africa – Mali and Zimbabwe – met that target.Instead, an analysis of 39 African countries by UK charity Oxfam found, spending on agriculture fell as a share of budgets between 2019 and 2021.Agriculture makes up nearly 20% of Africa's GDP and more than half of Africans work in the sector, according to the World Bank. Most of this is low-productivity subsistence farming, and the region is a net importer of staples including wheat, palm oil and rice, the FAO says.Productivity and crop yields have increased, but they are still the lowest in the world and the FAO says they come nowhere close to keeping up with the continent's growing population, which the U.N. forecasts will more than triple to 4.3 billion by the end of the century.So agricultural production per capita is falling, according to the FAO.Self-sufficiency for major food commodities is decreasing. Without action, the World Bank says Africa's food import bill, which stood at $43 billion in 2019, could rise to $110 billion in 2025.""We have 65% of the world's available arable land. We have to wake up,"" Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, told Reuters. ""For me, the bare minimum is that Africa is able to feed itself.""""STRENGTH, BUT NO WORK""Nasib and Fardawsa spent a week in the hospital, receiving blood transfusions, medicine and nutritional biscuits. They recovered, but then Isak's four-month-old, Farhan, needed care.He received an emergency transfusion and treatment. The doctor prescribed syrups and supplementary iron tablets that the family cannot afford.""I don't have any money,"" she said.In search of aid and security, in November the family moved onto an abandoned military camp closer to the city centre.They are no longer harassed, but attacks by Islamist militants periodically send the city into lock-down. Isak's husband, Mohamed Ibrahim, hoped he could earn money for food in town, working as a porter.""I have strength but no work. I have a wooden wheelbarrow,"" he said. But most people use the services of tuk-tuks instead.After months on the move – from her village to the city, from camp to camp, and hospital to hospital – Isak is running out of energy. She believes she herself and two other children are now also anaemic.""If he gets a dollar or two, this is not even enough for food for the children.""

Both instruments rallied about 1.6% on Tuesday.Data showed U.S. CPI inflation eased more than expected to 7.1% in November, coming as a result of tighter monetary conditions, easing fuel prices and softening economic growth in the country. It also was the softest inflation reading seen in a year.Focus now turns to the conclusion of the Fed’s final meeting this year, due later in the day. The central bank is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points (bps).But markets will be closely watching an address by Fed Chair Jerome Powell after the meeting, to see whether the central bank thinks inflation has cooled sufficiently to begin further tapering its pace of interest rate hikes.A rally in risk-driven markets was also cut short on Tuesday by anticipation of the Fed, given that the central bank has maintained a largely hawkish stance against inflation this year.A series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed battered metal markets this year, as the bank made combating price pressures its main priority. Any signals of smaller rate hikes is likely to benefit markets in the near-term.Other precious metals also logged strong gains on Tuesday. Platinum futures rose 3.3%, while silver added 2.2%.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell on Wednesday amid continued uncertainty over demand in major importer China. Copper futures were down 0.2% to $3.8407 a pound.Story continuesWhile the red metal also rallied on Tuesday tracking a weaker dollar, fears of sluggish near-term demand kept gains in check.China is grappling with its worst COVID outbreak yet and is expected to see a surge in cases as it relaxes several virus-linked restrictions.But on the supply side, production of the red metal may tighten in the near-term, especially due to public unrest in world no.2 copper producer Peru.Related ArticlesGold steadies above $1,800, Fed comments on inflation awaitedOil rally stalls on surprise U.S. inventory build, Fed in focusChina's re-opening and the J-curve in oil consumption: Kemp]"

She will become the first woman in the role.Mr Murray will move into a new senior role at News Corp, reporting to chief executive Robert Thompson.The reshuffle delivers further cross-pollination between Mr Murdoch’s businesses in the US and UK and will fuel ongoing speculation in media circles that Rebekah Brooks, News UK chief executive, is also being lined up for a senior role in New York.Allies of Mr Murdoch have suggested he was frustrated by The Wall Street Journal’s perceived failure in 2020 to aggressively pursue stories about President Biden’s son Hunter. Other outlets were credited with scoops involving a leaked cache of emails.Mr Thomson said Ms Tucker, who began her career in journalism at the Financial Times before joining the Murdoch stable in 2007, “will never knowingly be beaten to a scoop”.The Wall Street Journal is published by Dow Jones, while titles such as The Times and the Sun are overseen by News UK. All fall under the wider News Corp umbrella.It comes as 91-year-old Mr Murdoch explores a possible merger between News Corp and Fox, the US broadcaster behind Fox News, as he hands control of his empire to eldest son Lachlan.The change of role for Ms Tucker, who has led The Sunday Times since 2020, comes as it increasingly shares resources with its sister daily title to save costs and create a unified digital news service.Ben Taylor, current deputy editor of the Sunday Times, is said to be frontrunner for the role.Mr Murray joined Dow Jones in 1994 and has led the Wall Street Journal since June 2018. Last year The New York Times reported that he had clashed with Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, over the paper’s digital strategy. Dow Jones denied there had been friction.Story continuesMr Murdoch bought Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal in 2007 for $5bn, which even before the financial crisis was viewed as a full price. In contrast to radical changes imposed on his other brands he has struggled to put his stamp on the institution and its culture, however.A Special Committee was formed in agreement with its former owners, the billionaire Bancroft family, with a remit to safeguard editorial independence and ethical standards. It interviewed Ms Tucker prior to her appointment.She said: “As a long-time admirer and reader of the brilliant journalism of The Wall Street Journal, it is my honour to edit this great newspaper.“With some of the best writers and the wisest minds on its staff, this impactful publication continues to set the agenda and reach ever-wider digital audiences around the world. I look forward to working with Matt through the transition.”It came as The Guardian imposed a hiring freeze as it warned of slowdowns in advertising revenues and supporter growth, as well as rising costs.In an email to staff, Anna Bateson, chief executive of Guardian Media Group, said the company would implement a freeze on “all but essential” recruitment in non-editorial departments, while editorial hiring would continue to require senior approval.The newspaper will also cut back on discretionary spending such as travel and expenses with immediate effect.Ms Bateson said: “I realise this is a difficult message but I want to be completely transparent and work with everyone to protect the Guardian’s financial stability long-term.”]"

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Advisor, Tamara Erwin, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$49.77 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$37.86. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Crypto and freedom advocates should ensure decentralization as a principle is enshrined, and cooperate to realize and expand on Nikola Tesla’s vision of a decentralized, ubiquitous network.In the late 1800s, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse found themselves in an ideological battle over the future of electricity. Threatened by Tesla and Westinghouse’s widely adopted alternating currents (AC) power system, Edison built out his direct-current (DC) stations, while deploying ruthless public relations campaigns to undermine his rivals’ credibility. As the three men urgently took their products to market and built out supporting infrastructure, corporations on the periphery also competed for market share, including Brush Electricity Company – which installed its arc lighting solutions in key regions including New York City.Tim Kravchunovsky is the Founder and CEO of Chirp. A graduate of Columbia University’s Masters Program, he has over 20 years experience as a network engineer and previously consulted for the World Bank.The AC system won out and became the gold standard underlying all electrification. An important lesson remains for those developing new architecture: The best technology can triumph only when it is also widely adopted.After developing the AC system, Tesla devoted much of his life to revolutionizing wireless electricity. The inventor envisioned infinite energy via a global network of towers that would electrify the world without wires. While investors including J.P. Morgan initially backed Tesla’s venture based on his past success with AC electricity, they later cut funding – a system handing such power over to end users, independent of the large companies who clashed during the “War of the Currents,” was too radical for many to handle at the time, and the technology wasn’t in place yet.Story continuesTesla died penniless in New York City, but his vision of ubiquitous energy run across a decentralized wireless system has served as inspiration for scientists, entrepreneurs and world leaders. Founders need to think carefully about the incentive structures that go into building such a system, while resisting centralized parties looking to co-opt its mechanisms under their own infrastructures – the blockchain sector in particular is in a unique position to guard against these attempts.While there is heroism in Elon Musk – an heir to Tesla’s legacy – stepping in to provide Starlink to Ukrainian citizens, there are also warnings that founders should note. Following Starlink’s deployment, Musk walked back his initial support for the cause and threatened to withdraw the program unless the U.S. Defense Department footed the bill. Although Musk also walked back these comments and kept Starlink operational in the region, the reversal revealed an incentive structure based on geopolitics, profit margins, and a billionaire’s impulses – which millions of innocent people suddenly found themselves tethered to. Musk is hardly an outlier when it comes to the murky relationship between centralized vested interests and state power. Telecom companies provide troves of data on millions of users daily to government entities.As the original use case of blockchain technology, Bitcoin allows any individual – no matter their socioeconomic class or country of origin – to take custody of their money. When applied to IoT devices, broadband and telecommunications infrastructure, blockchain technology can bestow more universe digital rights, including the ability to access modern internet and phone services without being surveilled.In the current “builder’s market,” blockchain developers and founders need to pay closer attention to the developments unfolding across telecommunications, broadband and IoT, rather than speculative digital asset bubbles that, unfortunately, defined the space over the past few years. Whether it’s setting up routers to power decentralized wireless networks (following in the tradition of Satoshi Nakamoto sending himself test amounts of bitcoin), or writing interoperable code, the crypto community should apply the principles of decentralization to this next frontier, and work together to ensure the ubiquitous network as envisioned by Tesla can take hold on the same scale as the inventor’s AC gold standard.]"

She says she gets to play the role of ""tech fairy godmother,"" helping teachers incorporate technology into their curricula. ""I get to wave my magic technology wand and help them do things that they weren't able to do before,"" she says.What Long Middle School teachers are doing now, with Dawson's help, is adding tech to their teaching in innovative ways, as well as taking advantage of free learning apps and lesson plans available on Verizon Innovative Learning HQ. ""Because [lessons] come with the apps, they're so engaging,"" she says. ""And they're so different from what we usually see in the classroom with science or social studies or any other subject. It really helps our students engage and get to that creative mode, that depth of knowledge.""Her colleagues say that Dawson's influence-or is it magic?-is transformative. ""She makes both teaching and learning come alive,"" says Lisa Hill, principal of Long Middle School.""Miss Dawson helped me incorporate technology-she gave me a lot of resources,"" says Paul Hopson, a special education teacher at the school. ""She's coming with her passion and makes you want to learn from her.""Story continuesIt's that passion for continuous learning that motivated Dawson to complete eight micro-credentials in one year, thanks to online offerings through Digital Promise and Verizon Innovative Learning HQ. Micro-credentials are digital certifications that verify an individual's competence in a specific skill or set of skills. These free professional development courses can then be applied in some states as continuing education credits (CECs) or units (CEUs), which are required to renew teaching licenses. ""I find that the best teachers I've worked with, the best leaders I've worked with, never stopped learning and growing,"" she says. ""And that is crucial to me as I go through my career-to never stop.""True to her style, Dawson incorporates all that she learns into her work as a coach. From one professional development course on Verizon Innovative Learning HQ, for example, she learned about leading through coaching. ""Once I took that microcredential, I was able to infuse that into my professional development for my teachers,"" Dawson says.Her colleagues have taken note. ""We now have a new way of teaching and learning because of Miss Dawson,"" says Hill.To access free learning apps, lesson plans and professional development courses aligned to micro-credentials, visit Verizon Innovative Learning HQ at www.verizon.com/learning.""I get to wave my magic technology wand and help them do things that they weren't able to do before.""Renee Dawson, Verizon Innovative Learning Schools coach at Long Middle SchoolView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Verizon on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: VerizonWebsite: http://www.verizon.com/responsibilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: VerizonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/731618/Waving-the-Magic-Wand-of-Tech-Innovation-at-an-Atlanta-Middle-School]"

Goldman Sachs believes the U.S. will avoid a recession in 2023, and even if a recession were to occur, it would be comparatively moderate given the strong underlying U.S. fundamentals. Although inflation and rampant interest rates remain the most significant short-term challenges, global factors like the war in Ukraine and China’s regional power and internal conditions are also impacting investor sentiment. Despite the volatile economic conditions, history indicates that during turbulent market spreads, investors should stay long and remain invested. To cope with the market turbulence, many investors have shifted their portfolios towards defensive and value equities to combat the taxing headwinds which they presently face. As per Goldman Sachs, investors should focus on quality stocks that are US-listed, benefit from a strong dollar, and display fortress balance sheets.In the first half of 2023, the S&amp;P 500 is expected to mimic the declines of 2022, but a pivot from the Fed could support an asset recovery in the later half of the year, taking the S&amp;P 500 to 4,200 by the end of 2023. Keeping this in mind, investors often pick up large-cap stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

They have an unusual asset position – a very low cost basis in the Illinois Basis – almost all of which is thermal coal used in electricity generation. You might have noticed that the United States is theoretically attempting to transition our power needs in a ten-year plan when the reality is that 50 is probably the realistic number. The drive to this unrealistic goal is producing a severe shortage of “baseline” power production, which is simply not a good thing. Our bet is that Hallador’s assets are worth a lot more and will generate cash for a lot longer than is being priced in by the market. There is an interesting and financially savvy board guiding the CEO. In a new and interesting twist, the company essentially is being “given” a coal fired power plant in their backyard due to political issues. This could represent an enormous piece of upside subject to the vagaries of regulation and weather. Although we have followed the company for many years, this was a new buy in the quarter.”8.

The company paid its first dividend of $1 per share in August and also announced a policy of distributing at least 35% of its free cash flow to its shareholders.

If you want to read about some more best performing stocks in November, go directly to 5 Best Performing Stocks in November.After the eventful month of October, which is widely known for stock market crashes, the United States (US) stock market jumped back on a revival path in November, generally considered one of the best months of the year for investors. The relative performance of stocks during the month, compared to the year, which has been the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 in more than a decade, revived hopes of a market rally at the turn of the year. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose by more than 5% in November, up 14% compared to the beginning of October. The month of November is also renowned for Black Friday sales, a day on which big national retailers put inventories on sale. This November, on Black Friday, the shopping crowds and sales were better compared to last year, according to some estimates, although they still fell short of the traffic seen before the advent of the pandemic. Overall, sales for US retail outlets increased by 2.3% year-on-year to a record $9.1 billion. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), 196.7 million Americans went shopping over the Black Friday weekend. The NRF report claims that this was nearly a 9.4% increase from last year’s 179.8 million shoppers. Moreover, Adobe Analytics reported that online sales on Cyber Monday totaled $11.3 billion, up 5.8% from 2021 and Black Friday online sales were $9.12 billion, 2.3% above 2021’s $8.92 billion. The gain that the S&amp;P 500 registered in November brought the losses year-to-date for the index to around 14.3% at the end of November. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.67% during the time and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 jumped 5.95%.Heading into 2023, it is likely that interest rates will rise, though slower than previously expected, despite peak inflation. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which discourages companies from borrowing and investing to expand their businesses. This results in a macro slowdown for investors, and even earnings growth tends to stagnate. Some of the best-performing stocks despite these concerns in November included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that registered a more than 20% gain in share price in November were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Best Performing Stocks in NovemberSource: pexelsBest Performing Stocks in November10.

Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.”9. Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34     Gain in Share Price in November: 49%Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) engages in the research, development, and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart.

Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favour The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped-up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44     Gain in Share Price in November: 30%SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries.

These products are near-ubiquitous in our daily lives, whether we know it or not. They serve as the embedded brains of all sorts of electronic devices and end products that are increasingly smart and connected to the internet, such as cars, phones, kitchen appliances, factory equipment, and so on. Importantly, microcontrollers and analog chips represent a small percentage of the end product bill of materials, yet account for a disproportionately large portion of the performance characteristics of that product. Product cycles and customer retention are very long, as once designed into a product, Microchip is rarely replaced. Growth should be well above average for many years given the increasing electronification around us. In addition, management has announced its intention to return a sizeable portion of its cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We like this dual threat of growth together with excess cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Stocks in November. Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy20 Countries That Produce the Most Electric Power15 Countries That Produce the Most OilDisclosure.

309,f3b36d1f-ca01-32b1-9e4a-f64bc81aa50c,NVDA,2022-12-14,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-trending-stock-140002484.html,1670940002,STORY,['NVDA'],"[Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +7.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 3.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.4%. This estimate has changed -9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.37 indicates a change of +33.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.3%. The $26.94 billion and $29.42 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +9.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”9.

The global economy has been rattled by the Ukraine war, lingering supply chain troubles and a sweeping energy crisis in Europe. Aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation have kept investors on tenterhooks.Year to date, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have dropped 28.8% and 16.3%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also down 6.4%.Identifying stocks to add to the investment portfolio in such a highly volatile market scenario can be quite challenging.Nevertheless, few Dow stocks have bucked the general trend and have seen price appreciation in the year. Investors might consider adding these stocks, which have proven resilient compared to the Dow Jones index.Dow Jones equity index consists of 30 of the country’s most prominent and valuable companies or blue-chip companies. Adding blue chip stocks to one’s portfolio amid a volatile market scenario is mostly considered as a safe investment bet.Blue chip stocks are usually less volatile to market vagaries. These companies generally have a large market cap, solid cash flows, a healthy balance sheet and, in most cases, a stable dividend policy.Therefore, we bring you the top five stocks — Chevron Corporation CVX, Merck &amp; Co MRK, Amgen AMGN, The Travelers Companies, Inc TRV and International Business Machines Corporation IBM — that have fared relatively better than the Dow Jones Index this year for investment consideration.5 Stocks that Minimized Dow Jones LossesChevron: Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world and is the only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares of Chevron have risen 44.7% year to date, outperforming Dow Jones and the Zacks sub-industry’s 43.7% gain during the same period.Chevron is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. The energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, owing to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, the San Ramon, CA-based company had $15.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $23.6 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization of a modest 12.9%.Chevron's earnings and cash flows have been steadily improving, boosted by higher crude realizations and a recovery in consumption. Earlier in the year, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by 6% to $1.42 per share (or $5.68 per share annualized) and promised anything between $5 billion and $15 billion worth of buybacks each year. Chevron recorded $37.1 billion in cash flow from operations during the nine months ended Sep 30, surging from $19.7 billion a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by $1.12 to $19.17 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 135.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck &amp; Co: Merck &amp; Co boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales.

Keytruda sales are benefiting from healthy momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers. Its new COVID oral antiviral pill, Lagevrio has become a key top-line driver in 2022.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 1 cent to $7.38 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 22.6%.Amgen: Amgen is one of the prominent biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, bone health and nephrology and neuroscience markets.

In the last reported quarter, these drugs generated a combined $2 billion in sales with volume growth of 17%.New drugs Lumakras and Tezspire are off to an encouraging start. The acquisition of ChemoCentryx has added a strategic new growth asset to Amgen’s portfolio.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised upward by 20 cents to $17.66 per share over the past 60 days, indicating a year-over-year increase of 3.3%.The Travelers Companies: The company, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide variety of property and casualty insurance and surety products and services to businesses, organizations and individuals in the United States and select international markets.Shares of Travelers have gained 19.6% outperforming the sub-industry’s increase of 5.1% in a year.Travelers boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth.

It anticpiates fixed income NII or net investment income, including earnings from short term securities, to be around $500 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter.Consistent efforts to return excess capital to shareholders through dividend hike and share buybacks bode well. In the first nine months of 2022, the company repurchased $1.5 billion worth of shares and about $60 million that were not part of its publicly announced share repurchase authorizations. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had $2.51 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations.IBM: IBM has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms.

Free tours fully booked,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/queen-mary-back-business-2-184933079.html,1670957373,STORY,['DIS'],"[The Queen Mary is docked in Long Beach in May 2021. The tourist attraction will reopen Thursday for the first time since it closed during the pandemic in March 2020. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)The Queen Mary is back in business.Beginning Thursday, fans of the aging Long Beach tourist attraction will be able to tour sections of the vessel for the first time since March 2020, the city of Long Beach announced this week. To celebrate, the city is offering free guided tours for a limited time.The hour-long tours include biographical lessons, including some haunted history, about the Queen Mary and access to select areas of its promenade deck, all led by a docent. Tours were full by Tuesday morning, according to the city’s website.The hotel, restaurants, bar and other amenities will remain closed until plumbing and other repair work are completed in early 2023, according to the city.The occasion comes after the pandemic shuttered the converted British ocean liner to the public and a series of renovations, including critical structural repair work, delayed its reopening. Several studies have estimated the vessel needs hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades to continue operating. A 2021 report called for $23 million in immediate repairs to prevent the ship from capsizing.The city has previously said that about 75% of the process — largely plumbing, mechanical and other metalwork — should be completed by the end of the year. All internal repairs should be wrapped up in early 2023, allowing the city to work on aesthetic projects, like painting and flooring.“The Queen Mary has been an icon of our Long Beach shoreline for 55 years,” Councilmember Mary Zendejas said. “We remain dedicated in our efforts to preserve the ship’s history and structural safety. I look forward to welcoming the community back on board!”Over the last 50 years, Long Beach has brought in several firms — including Walt Disney Co. — to try to convert the former ocean liner-turned-floating hotel into a profitable tourist attraction, with mixed results. Disney planned in 1990 to incorporate the ship into a $3-billion sea-themed amusement park but ditched the idea a few years later.Story continuesLong Beach had considered sinking the 86-year-old ship after taking control of the vessel last year from the previous lease operator, Eagle Hospitality Trust, which filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on lease agreements. But even scuttling or scrapping it brought an estimated $190-million price tag, officials learned.Keeping the Queen Mary afloat has cost an estimated $6 million since the restoration project got underway earlier this year. But officials say the price tag is offset because the ship generates revenue through special events and filming opportunities, including a popular Halloween celebration.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Walt Disney (DIS) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Disney currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.48, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.48 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.2% and 13.6% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for DISBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for DISCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Disney here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Disney, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is DIS Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Disney, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 2.7% over the past month to $4.08.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Disney. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Disney with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They are designed to provide investors with a high degree of exposure to a particular asset class or market segment. Unlike traditional ETFs, leveraged ETFs are designed to magnify the return of the underlying index. They do this by using derivatives such as options and futures contracts, as well as borrowing money to increase the size of their portfolio. This can lead to amplified gains, but also amplified losses.It's a Two Way StreetLet's take an example to understand the behavior of a leveraged ETF. A 3x leveraged ETF seeks to deliver three times the daily performance of the underlying index. So, if the underlying index rises 1%, the ETF will rise 3%. Conversely, if the underlying index falls 1%, the ETF would decline 3%. Leveraged ETFs are a popular tool for traders and investors who want to take advantage of short-term price movements. Leveraged ETFs can also be used to hedge against market volatility or to diversify a portfolio. However, investing in leveraged ETFs carries a high degree of risk by nature, and investors should evaluate their risk tolerance before exploring this instrument.By design, leveraged ETFs are more suitable for day traders or investors with a short-term time horizon. For investors that do not have the risk tolerance for trading leveraged ETFs, they can opt for individual stocks that are among these funds' holdings. Some of the most popular long-term stocks among elite money managers and also present in leveraged ETFs include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).Photo by Behnam Norouzi on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyTo determine the best performing leveraged ETFs in 2022, we screened for leveraged ETFs with varying ratios including 1.25, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x.

We think this pricing power should protect profitability during the acute inflationary phase and potentially lead to margin expansion when cost pressures abate.

325,0cbbd058-d234-3006-bc11-dc389cdb8f49,HP,2022-12-14,5 High-Flying Must-Buy Mid Caps for 2023 From a Volatile 2022,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-high-flying-must-buy-115911877.html,1671019151,STORY,"['FRO', 'SMCI', 'CEIX', 'HP']","[We are about to close a highly disappointing 2022 with less than two weeks of trading days left. A record-high inflation rate and the Fed’s ultra-hawkish monetary tightening with a rigorous hike in interest rate and concerns about a near-term recession resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 6.1%, 15.7% and 28.1%, respectively. Likewise, the mid-cap centric benchmark — the S&amp;P 400 Index — has tanked 11.7% year to date. Despite these negatives, it will be prudent to invest in mid-cap stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have skyrocketed in 2022 and have solid upside left for 2023.Here are five such mid-cap (market capital &gt; $1 billion and &lt; $10 billion) stocks — e.l.f. Beauty Inc. ELF, Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. HP, Frontline Ltd. FRO, CONSOL Energy Inc. CEIX and Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI.Why Mid-Cap StocksInvestment in mid-cap stocks is often recognized as a good portfolio diversification strategy. These stocks combine the attractive attributes of both small and large-cap stocks. Top-ranked mid-cap stocks have a high potential of enhancing their profitability, productivity and market share. These may also become large caps in due course of time.If the economic recovery slows down due to any unforeseen internal or external disturbance, mid-cap stocks will be less susceptible to losses than their large-cap counterparts owing to less international exposure.On the other hand, if the crisis doesn’t worsen, these stocks will gain more than small caps due to established management teams, a broad distribution network, brand recognition and ready access to the capital markets.A Few PositivesThe Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for the month of November rose 0.1% month-over-month compared with the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.3%. Year over year, the CPI increased 7.1% year over year against the consensus estimate of a 7.3% rise.Story continuesThe core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.2% month over month and 6% on an annual basis, compared with respective consensus estimates of 0.3% and 6.1%. The core CPI inflation came below the consensus estimate for the last two months.The decline in CPI and core CPI may be marginal but peak inflation seems behind us. In fact, economic indicators like a tepid housing sector, declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, a gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate were pointing to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.A less-than-expected inflation rate in October and November with respect to several measures along with a dovish comment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in November boosted investors’ confidence and a possible reduction of the magnitude of the interest rate hike starting from the December FOMC meeting should boost market participants’ confidence in risky assets like equities.Out Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five mid-cap stocks that have popped in 2022 with solid upside left for 2023.

With a growing enrollment of more than 1,600 students representing over 30 nationalities and a need to better support its Vision 33 roadmap, CIS embarked this year on a journey to transform the network experience at its Hong Kong Campus.CIS has always been at the forefront of hybrid learning, having prioritized the implementation of digital tools and technology to deal with various local situations which had made school closures necessary. With the territory continuing to face pandemic-related lockdowns, CIS saw the opportunity to evaluate upgrades to its campus wireless network. The aim was to be able to welcome back its students later in the year with a refreshed and robust wireless network, to better cater to students who have grown more adept at technology and provide seamless access to bandwidth intensive applications, digital tools and resources.To uphold its commitment to providing high-quality learning experiences, CIS partnered with Juniper to build an AI-driven network that can meet the evolving and diverse needs of its students and staff. Furthermore, in keeping with the school’s own sustainability agenda, which includes a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2033, CIS sought to collaborate with a vendor who shared similar goals for the environment. Juniper’s commitment to sustainability and recent carbon neutral pledge played an important role in the vendor selection process.Story continuesCIS deployed the Juniper Wireless Access Points in conjunction with the Juniper Mist Wi-Fi Assurance service, providing students and staff with uninterrupted access to seamless high-speed, reliable connectivity at all times and from any location on campus. With this deployment, the school's lean IT team can streamline network operations, speed up troubleshooting and gain unprecedented insight into the user experience. This is significant for CIS, which now sees over 4,000 devices connected to the network daily, from mobile phones to laptops to tablets.With an AI-driven network powered by Juniper, CIS can support an increasing number of connected devices while also keeping up with current and future network demands as more students access digital learning tools and resources. Looking ahead, the school hopes to expand the use of Mist AI capabilities in its Hong Kong campus and bring AI-driven networking to its Hangzhou campus in the future.Supporting Quotes:""Throughout our partnership with Juniper Networks, our experience has been nothing short of seamless. By leveraging Juniper’s Mist AI and cloud, we were able to program the access points off-site, seamlessly deploy them and have the network up and running in three days. Our students and staff were able to return to campus the following day and connect to the network without even noticing anything had changed. With an AI-driven network, we remain bold and are confident in our ability to continue to provide superior digital learning experiences for our students as they continue in their pursuit of excellence, commitment to service and stewardship of our future.""- Sunil Talwar, Deputy Director of Operations, Chinese International School""It is an honor to work with the Chinese International School to deliver a world-class education experience for its students. With our experience-first approach and AI-driven solutions, we have built a network that will support its students' evolving needs and facilitate seamless access to digital tools and resources that will unlock immersive learning experiences. We remain committed to growing our relationship with CIS and look forward to working closely with them to fully realize the potential of an AI-driven network across all their operations, beginning with their Hong Kong campus.""- Thomas Chan, Country Manager, Hong Kong &amp; Macau, Juniper NetworksAdditional Resources:Case Study: Hong Kong’s Chinese International School enhances dual-language learning with AI-driven Wi-FiJuniper Networks Wireless Access PointsJuniper Mist Wi-Fi AssuranceFollow Juniper Networks online: Facebook | Twitter | LinkedInJuniper Blogs and Community: J-NetAbout Juniper NetworksJuniper Networks is dedicated to dramatically simplifying network operations and driving superior experiences for end users.

These new funds offer compelling investment strategies, combined with the benefits of the ETF structure, including increased transparency and greater tax-efficiency,"" said Stuart Parker, president and CEO of PGIM Investments.FULLY TRANSPARENT GROWTH AND VALUE ETFS The PGIM Jennison funds are fully transparent ETFs with concentrated, high-conviction portfolios. Jennison’s equity investment approach is rooted in deep, fundamental research and bottom-up security selection. Both funds’ investment strategies are substantially similar to those of their respective mutual fund and institutional strategy counterparts.The PGIM Jennison Focused Growth ETF (PJFG) seeks to provide long-term growth of capital by investing in a focused portfolio of primarily mid- and large-capitalization stocks believed to have strong capital appreciation potential. The Fund’s investment team believes that excess returns can be generated by investing in market-leading companies that create economic value through unique business models, long-duration competitive advantages and catalysts that drive growth rates well above that of the market.The PGIM Jennison Focused Value ETF (PJFV) seeks to provide long-term growth of capital by investing in a focused portfolio of predominantly large-capitalization companies believed to be undervalued compared to their perceived worth. The Fund’s investment team looks for companies that have one or more of the following characteristics: attractive valuation metrics that are unique to that business, high levels of durability and viability of the business, good business models that are being mispriced, high returns on assets and/or equity, high free cash flow yields, management teams that are willing to make changes, and/or something operationally wrong that can be fixed or is temporary.Story continuesA MULTI-ASSET ETF TO HELP NAVIGATE MARKET VOLATILITY The PGIM Portfolio Ballast ETF (PBL), seeks to provide long-term capital growth with reduced volatility compared to the equity market. PBL’s long-term goal is to capture 60% of the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on average in appreciating equity markets, and to capture 30% of the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on average in declining equity markets over a market cycle.Like ballast on a ship providing critical stability amid rough waters, the PGIM Portfolio Ballast ETF offers what may be an attractive and uniquely diversifying solution in the face of uncertain and turbulent markets.PBL’s underlying strategy is substantially similar to the U.S. Market Participation Strategy (MPS) — an institutional strategy with a live 30-year track record and more than $1 billion of client capital as of Oct. 31, 2022.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2022. This year’s inflation and continued interest rates hike were heavy on the markets. Analysts recommended investing in income-generating stocks because they could stabilize overall portfolios through dividends. Moreover, regular income in these times is massively rewarding for anxious investors. Companies like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) remained popular among investors because of their regular dividend growth and solid balance sheets.The historical analysis of dividend stocks revealed that these securities have outperformed other asset classes during previous inflationary periods. This is mainly because many companies keep on raising their dividends even during periods of slow economic growth. Since 1957, dividends have grown at an average of 5.7%, more than 2% above the rate of inflation during this time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. The report also mentioned that dividends in the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 5.45% return from 1991 to 2021, compared with a 2.51% growth in the Consumer Price Index.According to a report by JPMorgan, equity performance turns negative during recessionary periods. This results in a drop in earnings-per-share. However, dividends remain stable during these times as companies avoid slashing their payouts. The report referred to data by Ibbotson, Refinitiv Datastream, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management and mentioned that since 1926, dividends have accounted for a significant percentage of overall market returns.In view of this, we will discuss the best dividend stocks of 2022.Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with the highest returns in 2022 so far. These companies also have strong balance sheets and sound financials. The stocks are ranked according to their year-to-date returns, as of December 12.Story continues16. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Year-to-date Returns as of December 12: 34.04%Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an American energy company that is engaged in the exploration of hydrocarbons. In December, Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock to $98 with an Overweight rating on the shares, following the company's strong performance in the third quarter.Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 29 years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share for a dividend yield of 8.52%, as of December 12.In addition to dividend stocks like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), investors are also paying attention to DVN due to the company's strong dividend growth track record.In Q3 2022, Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) reported revenue of $5.43 billion, which showed a 56.5% growth from the same period last year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”15.

In addition to COP’s low-cost resource base, conservative balance sheet and experienced management team, we appreciate its strong focus on ESG measures, which we believe is a good indicator of the quality of a company’s business model and management team.Specifically, we appreciate solid governance practices with compensation metrics emphasizing ROCE and relative total shareholder return, the board’s effective oversight of management as well as the company’s methane flaring leadership. COP is investing in field electrification and carbon capture across its portfolio, with ambitions to deliver oil production with a CO2 intensity of sub-5 kg/BOE, which would be one of the lowest emission sources of supply in the world.”9.

Management provided a new profit outlook for Fiscal 2023 and announced an improvement plan for the medical segment.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”6.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $3.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Devon Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Devon Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.44 per share to $2.11 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Devon Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Today’s CPI number and Wednesday’s FOMC decision will likely facilitate higher volumes and some market movement. However, volumes will probably dry up as we enter the end-of-year doldrums. Nevertheless, catalyst-driven moves such as earnings reports, analyst movements, and surprise company-specific headlines are worth monitoring. Below, we will cover 5 of the top headline-driven moves. 1.)         Boeing (BA): Shares of the leading aerospace company rose by nearly 4% after a positive analyst note from JP Morgan JPM. JPM raised their outlook on the airplane maker to “overweight” and cited catalysts including the return of production of the 787 and the re-certification of the troubled 737 Max in China, the largest airplane market in the world.2.)         Rivian Automotive RIVN: Monday, the Amazon AMZN backed electric car start-up slid 6% to more than 6-month lows on news that the company would be scrapping plans to pursue a joint venture with German luxury car maker Mercedes Benz. Ceo RJ Scaringe cited in a statement that “We pursue the best risk-adjusted returns based on our capital”. Rivian has yet to post a profit as a public company and sports a mediocre Zacks Ranking of 3. Shares rebounded on Tuesday after the surprise drop in CPI data was announced.3.)         Oracle ORCL: Database software giant Oracle reported earnings of $1.21 per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.17 per share. Shares gained 1.78% Monday and were up more than 4% early in Tuesday’s session. Oracle shares have been on the mend in recent weeks. Earlier in the month, Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL won a piece of a pentagon contract totaling an estimated $9 billion. The technical picture for ORCL shows that the 50-day moving average is crossing over the 200-day moving average in what is known as a “Golden Cross”, a bullish sign for shares.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: AMGN's 50-day crosses over its 200-day to form a ""Golden Cross"" pattern.Software stocks were already strong after news broke that private equity firm Thoma Bravo will take Coupa Software COUP private in a deal worth over $6 billion. Elsewhere in software, shares of Box Inc BOX launched higher after an upgrade, while Nutanix NTNX worked on its 8th straight week in the green.4.)         Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP): Amgen AMGN acquired shares of Horizon Therapeutics in a $27.8 billion mega-deal announced and hammered out over the weekend. Shares of Horizon jumped 15% on the news. Amgen has a Zacks Rank of 3 however, the company has been performing well as of late and is highly profitable. AMGN pulled back slightly on the news and is testing its rising 50-day moving average, a dip buying zone often used by intermediate traders.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: AMGN is looking to get support at its rising 50-day moving average - a key level for intermiediate speculators.5.)         Moderna MRNA: The therapeutic and vaccine maker saw shares rise by nearly 20% early Tuesday after news broke that Moderna’s mRNA vaccine for melanoma reduced death and recurrence of disease in a Phase 2 trial. Moderna’s drug is taken in combination with Merck’s MRK Keytruda drug. Shares of MRK were little changed. Moderna’s stock is rebounding from an initial slowdown after enjoying windfall profits from its Covid 19 vaccine. The stock found clear support at its 50-day moving average as volume traded above the 50-day average just minutes into the session.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Though Moderna's estimates and stock have retreated, today's news may be the catalyst it needs to get back on track.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As 5G deployment increases, the real-world uses of AI in automation, cloud, and large databases, are likely to drive the demand for the new technology even further, a prime example being the popularity of smart homes and smart cities. One of the most important parts of this growth is the chip industry. According to a report by the Business Research Company, the artificial intelligence chip market size is expected to grow from $10 billion in 2021 to $15 billion in 2022, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of more than 42%. Despite supply issues due to rising demand and the global geopolitical crisis, the AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49 billion in 2026.

Here is what the fund said:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for long-term investors.”14. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Market Capitalization: $30 Billion     Rockwell Automation, Inc.

(NYSE:ROK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), a Milwaukee-based industrial automation company, struggled early in the year with component shortages that prevented it from clearing its overflowing order books and rising input costs. Uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine prompted management to warn in May of lower profits for the rest of the year. Behind the frustrations, however, were indications that the business outlook remained strong, as order volume continued to grow following price increases at the end of 2021. In the recent quarter, the company reported stronger results despite ongoing supply chain issues that hindered its ability to fulfil orders. To mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, Rockwell has been accumulating inventory and redesigning certain products. We believe Rockwell will see its revenues expand as its resilience improves and supply shortages recede.”13. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Market Capitalization: $40 Billion Baidu, Inc.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) with 2.6 million shares worth more than $305.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Ariel Investment, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“China’s internet search and online community leader Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) also weighed on relative results in the quarter. Continuing macro headwinds driven by China’s Zero-Covid policy are resulting in sluggish advertising trends. Looking ahead, the company remains committed to sustainable, profitable growth as management works to improve overall operational efficiency, executing its strategic commitments around technological innovation and the transition to a green economy. We also continue to be enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”12.

Launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce 3090 and GeForce 3080 GPUs, GDDR6X takes graphics to new levels of gaming realism and unleashes high-performance AI inference. Micron has been chasing maximum bandwidth memory to support gaming and professional visualization for a long time. It also includes how Micron has achieved staggering speeds with GDDR6X, the future of AI training with HBM2E, and other high-bandwidth products. On December 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Market Capitalization: $90 Billion     General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa.

On December 5, Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase maintained a Buy rating on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock and raised the price target to $94 from $89, noting that the industrial economy can show unprecedented resilience, as the supply chain is only just beginning to heal, backlogs are extended, and order growth generally remains quite healthy.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Group is a leading shareholder in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) with 13.8 million shares worth more than $852 million.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Longleaf Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments has strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Market Capitalization: $118 Billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide.

On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company announced a cost reduction plan, which should help but doesn’t help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Market Capitalization: $113 Billion     Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide.

(NASDAQ:AMD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $75, noting that the PC segment has been early in digesting inventory and been dragging down growth, but overall CPU shipments are annualizing to about 230MM units in fourth quarter, which is far below even the most bearish market forecasts for PCs in 2023.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.99 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), compared to 87 in the previous quarter worth $4.8 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more)8.

On October 17, analyst David Grossman maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $140 from $150, noting that the company is defensive and likely impacted less than most large-cap tech, but not immune to slowing GDP growth.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)7. Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and lowered the price target to $52 from $54, noting that the upside from the fiscal first quarter beat is tempered by a more cautious view on a tougher macro backdrop in upcoming periods. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”6. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Market Capitalization: $219 Billion  Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide.

Oracle noted that, along with OCI’s AI cloud infrastructure of bare metal, cluster networking, and storage, enterprises will get a broad, accessible portfolio of options for AI training and deep learning.  On December 5, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained an Equal Weight rating on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock and raised the price target to $81 from $70, noting that the company’s exposure to back-office workflows and its smaller but hyper-growth OCI business make sales less susceptible to growing macro pressure than other software names.   Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) with 25.9 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the biggest AI companies in the world. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest AI Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

Beer, burritos and coffee according to Grubhub's sixth annual deep dive into its customers' food and drinking habits.The food delivery giant, a unit of Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), broke down the top orders by specific dishes, meal type (breakfast, lunch, and late-night), desserts, alcohol, coffee, and even dipping sauces.This year's winner: Burritos, in a bowl or the classic wrap.The burrito moved up from its 2021 eighth spot to the top pick as customers were keen on the ability to customize the handheld takeout item, Grubhub found. People ordered burritos a whopping 4 million times this year, and with all types of fillings, from sausage and eggs to guac and sour cream. In 2021, the Impossible Foods burger was the #1 choice but fell out of the Top 10 in 2022.The humble cheeseburger, meanwhile, took the number two spot, followed by cheese pizza, pad thai, chicken quesadillas, California rolls, fried chicken sandwiches, caesar salads, and chicken tikka masala. Boneless wings rounded out the Top 10.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Breakfast timeBreakfast orders across the U.S. ranked in the following order: sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches, donuts, sausage burritos, bagels with cream cheese, and then muffins. (In New York City, however, a bagel was the ultimate go-to breakfast order.)Denver took the No.1 spot from New York City, having the most early-bird breakfast orders, those placed between 5 a.m. ET and 8 a.m. ET.To go along with breakfast or for a quick pick-me-up throughout the day, Americans chose iced coffee, up from the No. 3 spot in 2021, ""regardless of the temperature outside,"" the report noted. Iced options were actually the four out of five top coffee orders. Hot coffee came in at No. 2, followed by iced caramel coffee, iced french vanilla, and frozen coffee.

Gallagher AJG, Willis Tower Watson plc and Brown &amp; Brown Inc. BRO.Industry: Insurance BrokerageLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2028087/5-insurance-brokers-to-watch-amid-industry-headwindsBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher, Willis Tower Watson plc and Brown &amp; Brown Inc.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests, against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity.Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed health care services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to grow to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesGovernment-undertaken initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design customizable products that are more appealing to customers.This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Per Deloitte Insights, The Swiss Re Institute projects an increase in demand for insurance, which, in turn, will drive a 3.9% increase in premiums in 2022.Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

Gallagher AJG, Willis Tower Watson plc WLTW and Brown &amp; Brown Inc. BRO.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests, against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed health care services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to grow to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, rising at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government-undertaken initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve.

349,cdeca4bd-95e3-32ca-8e84-944a3942d0a5,MCD,2022-12-14,McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Not Lagging Market On Growth Or Pricing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-mcd-not-120044813.html,1671019244,STORY,['MCD'],"[McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE:MCD) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 34x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.McDonald's hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for McDonald's peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on McDonald's will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, McDonald's would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 18%. Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 15% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that McDonald's' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From McDonald's' P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that McDonald's maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  McDonald's is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of McDonald's' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

Beer, burritos and coffee according to Grubhub's sixth annual deep dive into its customers' food and drinking habits.The food delivery giant, a unit of Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), broke down the top orders by specific dishes, meal type (breakfast, lunch, and late-night), desserts, alcohol, coffee, and even dipping sauces.This year's winner: Burritos, in a bowl or the classic wrap.The burrito moved up from its 2021 eighth spot to the top pick as customers were keen on the ability to customize the handheld takeout item, Grubhub found. People ordered burritos a whopping 4 million times this year, and with all types of fillings, from sausage and eggs to guac and sour cream. In 2021, the Impossible Foods burger was the #1 choice but fell out of the Top 10 in 2022.The humble cheeseburger, meanwhile, took the number two spot, followed by cheese pizza, pad thai, chicken quesadillas, California rolls, fried chicken sandwiches, caesar salads, and chicken tikka masala. Boneless wings rounded out the Top 10.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Breakfast timeBreakfast orders across the U.S. ranked in the following order: sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches, donuts, sausage burritos, bagels with cream cheese, and then muffins. (In New York City, however, a bagel was the ultimate go-to breakfast order.)Denver took the No.1 spot from New York City, having the most early-bird breakfast orders, those placed between 5 a.m. ET and 8 a.m. ET.To go along with breakfast or for a quick pick-me-up throughout the day, Americans chose iced coffee, up from the No. 3 spot in 2021, ""regardless of the temperature outside,"" the report noted. Iced options were actually the four out of five top coffee orders. Hot coffee came in at No. 2, followed by iced caramel coffee, iced french vanilla, and frozen coffee. Oat milk came in ahead of almond, coconut, soy, and cashew milk for the top milk alternative ordered with coffee.What's for lunch?HYATTSVILLE, MD - SEPTEMBER 12: New in September 2022, Chipotle's garlic guajillo steak is seasoned with garlic and guajillo peppers, grilled fresh in small batches and hand cut into bite size pieces finished with lime and cilantro.

Salads came in at No. 6 though, with Greek, caesar, house and cobb options ordered the most.Story continuesAmericans were pretty particular about their sauce choices too but stuck generally to the basics. Dipping sauces ranked in the following order: ketchup, ranch, buffalo sauce, honey mustard, and spicy mustard.In Los Angeles, buffalo sauce was the top condiment over ketchup.Boston's the late-night #1! Grubhub customers in Boston, a big college town, placed the most orders after 10 p.m., per the report. (Nationwide? Grubhub said it delivered more than 3 million late night orders.)Similar to the top dishes, the top five orders included chicken quesadillas, fried chicken sandwiches, cheeseburgers, mozzarella sticks, and cheese pizza.In 2022, the top dessert orders included tiramisu, ordered 44,000 times, followed by baklava, ordered 35,000 times. Basic dessert items made up the rest of the top ten list: cookies, cheesecakes, brownies, churros, cannolis, carrot cake, chocolate cake, and flan.In Philadelphia though, its hometown dessert took the top spot, the Philly cheesecake.A rider for ""Grubhub"" food delivery service rides a bicycle during a delivery in midtown Manhattan following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, New York, U.S., July 9, 2020.

Red wine didn't make the top five list, all though it topped the 2021 list.This wasn't the case everywhere. In San Francisco, a long-stemmed glass of Sauvignon Blanc was the top drink of choice, while in Austin, ""Mexican Martinis"" were #1.""Casual Friday, was every day,"" the Grubhub report said.

(NYSE:PLD)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-140103223.html,1670853663,STORY,['PLD'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Prologis' (NYSE:PLD) recent performance, when its stock has declined 7.0% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Prologis'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Prologis How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, Prologis' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Prologis was able to see a decent growth of 17% over the last five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Prologis' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PLD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Prologis Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Prologis has a high three-year median payout ratio of 51%. This means that it has only 49% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Moreover, Prologis is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 107% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 6.6%) over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Prologis' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Seagate Technology Holdings (NASDAQ:STX) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Seagate Technology Holdings is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$8.6b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Seagate Technology Holdings has an ROCE of 27%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Seagate Technology Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Seagate Technology Holdings here  for free.The Trend Of ROCESeagate Technology Holdings' ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 35% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Seagate Technology Holdings' ROCETo sum it up, Seagate Technology Holdings is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 63% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings (1 can't be ignored)  you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.43, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 44.17.

The spin-off would better allow BorgWarner to focus on its set goals underlined in its Charging Forward strategy. The company estimated that after giving effect to the intended transaction, it is already on track with its organic bookings and acquisitions to date to deliver more than 22% of its revenues from EVs by 2025.Lithia bolstered its footprint in Colorado with the purchase of the Ferrari dealership in Denver. This is the company’s first Ferrari store purchase. Apart from Ferrari, the dealership also sells Bentley and other luxury brands. Lithia expects the dealership to generate around $75 million in annualized revenues, bringing LAD's total expected annualized revenues acquired in 2022 to more than $3.3 billion. The acquisition is part of LAD's nationwide network expansion initiative under the company's 2025 plan, wherein it targets $50 billion in revenues and EPS in the range of $55-$65.Lithia’s strategic buyouts are helping the auto retailer increase its market share and boost its portfolio. The spree of acquisitions brought Lithia's total expected annualized revenues acquired to $7 billion in 2021, keeping it ahead of schedule laid out in the five-year plan rolled out in July 2020. Its total expected annualized revenues acquired in 2022 have reached $3.3 billion.PACCAR gave investors a reason to cheer by boosting its dividend payout. The company declared a 50% stock dividend, rewarding investors with one additional share for each two shares held. While the new shares would be issued on Feb 7, 2023, to stockholders on record as of Jan 17, 2023, PACCAR will be paying a quarterly dividend of 25 cents on each newly-split share which will be payable on Mar 8 to shareholders on record as of Feb 14.Notably, PACCAR will pay an extra cash dividend of $2.80 a share, to be paid out on Jan 5, 2023, to shareholders on record as of Dec 16, 2022. This marks an 86.6% increase from the extra cash dividend of $1.50 a share paid in January 2022. PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941. PCAR has been generating robust cash flow on account of impressive growth in its trucking and aftermarket business, which enables it to remain committed to increasing its shareholder value. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the last week and six-month period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Next in the Auto Space?Industry watchers will keep a tab on November passenger vehicle registrations to be released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association soon.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Tractor Supply's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tractor Supply is:54% = US$1.0b ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.54.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Tractor Supply's Earnings Growth And 54% ROETo begin with, Tractor Supply has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 29% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Tractor Supply was able to see a decent net income growth of 20% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then compared Tractor Supply's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 33% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TSCO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Tractor Supply Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Tractor Supply's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 25% (implying that it retains 75% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Besides, Tractor Supply has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 41% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Tractor Supply's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

370,de9f480a-3730-33f7-b0d1-9b3241c1b18a,MDLZ,2022-12-14,Mondelez International's (NASDAQ:MDLZ) investors will be pleased with their respectable 76% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-internationals-nasdaq-mdlz-investors-120052959.html,1671019252,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Mondelez International share price has climbed 57% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 6.8% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Mondelez International managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.5% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 9%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Mondelez International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Mondelez International's TSR for the last 5 years was 76%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Mondelez International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 6.8% over the last year. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 12% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Mondelez International (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course Mondelez International may not be the best stock to buy.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $34.40 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Capital One shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Capital One is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Consumer Loans industry that ranks in the Bottom  7% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while nine have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.28 per share to $4.06 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Capital One right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Following the IND clearance, Vertex plans to start a single ascending dose clinical study in adult CF patients with a CFTR genotype not responsive to CFTR modulator therapy in the coming weeks.A leader in the CF space, Vertex’s main focus is on developing and strengthening of its CF franchise. The company’s portfolio consists of four medicines, all targeting the CF indication. These include Trikafta/Kaftrio, Symdeko (marketed as Symkevi in Europe), Orkambi and Kalydeco. During the third quarter of 2022, Vertex generated total revenues (entirely from CF product sales) worth $2.33 billion, up 18% year over year.Shares of Vertex have gained 43.1% in the year so far against the industry’s 19.0% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement estimates that more than 83,000 patients worldwide are affected by CF, a rare multi-organ disease affecting the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. It is caused by the lack of or defects in the CFTR protein, which leads to poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs.Per Vertex, its four CF medicines target the majority of the 83,000 patients living with CF across the world. Management estimates that VX-522, if approved, could benefit around 5,000 CF patients who still cannot benefit from its four marketed CF medicines.VX-522 is being developed by Vertex in collaboration with Moderna MRNA. Both Vertex and Moderna entered into a collaboration in 2016 to discover and develop mRNA therapeutics for CF. Per the terms of collaboration, Vertex is responsible for leading the preclinical and clinical development of therapies under this collaboration. Moderna is responsible for mRNA and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) process development and manufacturing. Moderna is also eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of potential products resulting from this collaboration.Story continuesWhile CF is one of the main focus areas of Vertex, the company is also focused on expansion beyond the CF space. Currently, Vertex has a rapidly advancing mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline across seven disease areas beyond CF like acute pain, sickle cell disease (SCD), beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD), alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and cell therapy for type I diabetes.The company is focused on exa-cel, a gene-therapy developed in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP in two devastating diseases — SCD and thalassemia. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics initiated a rolling biologics license application (BLA) filing with the FDA last month, which is expected to be completed by first-quarter 2023. If approved, exa-cel will be Vertex’s first non-CF product and CRISPR Therapeutics’ first marketed product.Vertex has already completed discussions on exa-cel for both SCD and TDT indications with European regulatory authorities. Based on these discussions, management intends to submit the regulatory filings in the European Union and the United Kingdom by this year’s end.Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a collaboration agreement in 2015. Apart from exa-cel, both companies are working on developing therapies for cystic fibrosis as well as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1).Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated PriceVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderVertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A better-ranked stock in the overall healthcare sector is Kamada KMDA, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

377,30a607ec-bcb9-34b8-be2a-6527dc30321b,KO,2022-12-14,"The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders sold US$14m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-130038118.html,1671022838,STORY,['KO'],"[Over the past year, many The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; CFO, John Murphy, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$62.29 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$63.99). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 28% of John Murphy's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Coca-Cola than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Coca-Cola Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. Specifically, Senior VP &amp; Chief Technical and Innovation Officer Nancy Quan ditched US$840k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.6% of the company, worth about US$1.8b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Coca-Cola Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Coca-Cola is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Coca-Cola. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola you should know about.But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

378,5c853989-bc18-3916-bf05-61c06d0bd914,WY,2022-12-14,Weyerhaeuser's (NYSE:WY) earnings trajectory could turn positive as the stock rises 3.8% this past week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weyerhaeusers-nyse-wy-earnings-trajectory-105200540.html,1671015120,STORY,['WY'],"[Most people feel a little frustrated if a stock they own goes down in price. But sometimes a share price fall can have more to do with market conditions than the performance of the specific business. The Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) is down 17% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -12% once you include the dividend. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 17%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 10% in the last three years.While the last year has been tough for Weyerhaeuser shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. Check out our latest analysis for Weyerhaeuser To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unhappily, Weyerhaeuser had to report a 7.5% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 17% is actually more than the EPS drop. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, a year ago. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 10.59.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Weyerhaeuser's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Weyerhaeuser, it has a TSR of -12% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Weyerhaeuser shares lost 12% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 17%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 3% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Weyerhaeuser better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Weyerhaeuser (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The company announced its collaboration with Denbury Inc. DEN for the evaluation and potential development of a CO2 sequestration site, located at Simpson and Copiah Counties in Mississippi.Per the lease agreement, Denbury will develop and operate approximately 16,000 acres of WY’s subsurface pore space, which is adjacent to its NEJD Pipeline. Denbury plans to utilize the site to permanently sequester industrial CO2 in secure underground geologic formations, while Weyerhaeuser will continue to manage the timberland acreage as a sustainable working forest.WY’s senior vice president and chief development officer, Russell Hagen, stated, “This agreement represents another important milestone in the growth of our carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) business, and it supports our broader commitment to sustainability and providing natural climate solutions across our land base. We are excited to partner on this project with Denbury and unlock the option value created when combining our uniquely positioned acreage and subsurface ownership with high-quality developers of CCS projects in the Gulf South.”Weyerhaeuser has always been on a carbon neutrality forefront. The recent move is also in line with its previously announced plan to grow its Natural Climate Solutions business, including through CCS, forest carbon offsets, renewable energy development, mitigation solutions and conservation. It has identified multiple locations for potential sequestration projects across a portion of its 7-million-acre footprint in the U.S. South using proprietary geological data covering its lands.More capital inflows for carbon/ESG-related projects are likely to prove beneficial for Weyerhaeuser. For the Natural Climate Solutions business, WY continues to remain engaged with high-quality developers for renewable energy and carbon capture and storage opportunities across its acreage.Governments and businesses across the globe are making efforts on climate change and aim to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. The company remains uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these goals through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Weyerhaeuser have gained 6.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 2% rally.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksWeyerhaeuser currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The return on their investment would have been much higher had they held on to their stock.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker Stryker Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Srikant T. Datar, for US$130k worth of shares, at about US$217 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$254). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 1.9% of Srikant T. Datar's holding.Stryker insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Stryker Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Stryker. Specifically, insiders ditched US$268k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Stryker Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Stryker insiders own 11% of the company, worth about US$11b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Stryker Insiders?Insiders sold Stryker shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Stryker is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Stryker has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

""Citrefix’s unique suture anchor system is the next step in our expanding Citregen portfolio.""Citrefix is a disposable suture anchor system that features a resorbable biomimetic anchor body. It is made with Citregen, an elastomeric material made from a citrate polymer specially designed to mimic bone chemistry for controlled resorption without chronic inflammation.1 These unique chemical and mechanical properties are designed to help grafted tissue heal and healthy bone to grow when used in orthopaedic surgical applications.2 The sterile-packed set includes a cartridge with preloaded implant and eyelet, a drill bit, a drill guide and pre-assembled inserter.""By leveraging Citregen’s unique material properties, Citrefix introduces design features that greatly increase its pull-out strength compared to other suture anchors,"" said Wayne Berberian, M.D., orthopedic surgeon at the Ankle &amp; Foot Institute in Maywood, N.

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the performance of the S&amp;P 500 so far this year, you can go directly to see the 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks That Don't Pay Dividends.The Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) is a stock market index that tracks the stock performance of pretty much the 500 largest companies listed on the major stock exchanges in the US. The index was subject to poorer performance over the last 12 months in light of various problems such as the geopolitical issues caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflationary and recession concerns due to the Fed's aggressive rate hike stance, and the bursting of the tech bubble. However, stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 saw broader gains in November and some market strategists are optimistic about December as well. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was also quoted as saying that the central bank will now slow its rate-hiking campaign, easing pressures on the market.A few of the most famous names on the S&amp;P 500 include companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). These being in the tech sector have consistently been among the best-performing sector on the index over the last decade. Such stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 rise by about 5.4% at the close of November. The broader benchmark index ended up outperforming the smaller Nasdaq Composite index, which gained only 4.4% over the same period.While many major companies on the index are also strong dividend payers, it is not a requisite condition for a company to be a dividend-payer for it to be an attractive investment choice. Many companies may choose to reinvest their proceeds from ongoing operations into their business models to retain their strong financial performance instead of paying out the same money to their shareholders. This opens larger avenues for a company's individual growth in the long run.Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks that don't pay dividends, to recommend attractive stock picks for investors looking to invest in solid companies with long-term growth potential.

Here's what the firm said:“We also don’t invest in pharmaceutical companies. While revenue and profits are protected by patents, their future revenue depends on how quickly their drugs are copied once they fall off patent and the success of their R&amp;D. Both are unpredictable.Instead, we prefer to invest in companies that sell testing equipment and related consumables to the industry. Waters, for example, is a share that we have watched for years and would like to invest in at the right price. The company’s instruments are critical to the production and development of drugs and are the gold standard in the industry. Furthermore, they are often included in the patent applications of customers. This trust and reputation take years to build, resulting in high profit margins. At the same time, it also means that even when a drug of their customer falls off patent, the manufacturers of the generic version are likely to continue using the same instruments as these were already approved in the original application. So, the company’s revenues and profits are less dependent on patent cliffs or the success of R&amp;D than those of pharmaceutical companies.”11. Synopsys, Inc.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”9. Biogen Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Chevron Corp. CVX, Roche Holding AG RHHBY, General Electric Co. GE, Centene Corp. CNC and Carrier Global Corp. CARR.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Chevron, Roche and General ElectricThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corp. (CVX), Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) and General Electric Co. (GE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Chevron have modestly outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+46.0% vs. +44.8%) but they have handily outperformed the broader market.The Zacks analyst sees Chevron as one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity will be a headwind should that scenario unfold again. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Roche have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-18.0% vs. +17.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that Roche’s performance in 2022 has been hit by significantly lower COVID-related sales in both divisions as the pandemic eased out. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) are declining with the pandemic weakening in several countries in 2022.Story continuesNevertheless, strong demand for new drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy), Phesgo (cancer) and Tecentriq (cancer), maintained momentum. The Diagnostics division also remained stable in terms of the growth of its routine business. However, competition is stiff for Tecentriq. The decline in sales of drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera will continue to drag sales down. Pipeline setbacks are a concern.(You can read the full research report on Roche here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of General Electric have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past six months (+22.3% vs. +8.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that strong performance of the Aerospace and Healthcare segments is driving General Electric’s growth. Its investments in productivity and innovation should fuel growth going forward. Cost-control measures and pricing actions are aiding its bottom line. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders are encouraging.However, supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs are weighing on the company’s performance. Weakness in the Power and Renewable energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning. Foreign currency headwinds are hurting the company’s top line.(You can read the full research report on General Electric here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Centene Corp.

It added it was aiming for certification in 2029.Supersonic Concorde-style flights have drawn interest from major carriers United Airlines and American Airlines, but Boom's push to be among the first to roll out such a plane suffered a setback earlier this year when Rolls-Royce pulled out and other leading suppliers opted not to fill the gap.General Electric, Safran and Honeywell International Inc have all said they have no plans to develop civil supersonic engines for the time being.That left Boom scouting for new partners to help shoulder heavy investments needed to launch a new jet and engine. The firm has raised $319 million as of October 2021 and was valued at $1.2 billion, according to PitchBook Data.Boom Chief Executive Officer Blake Scholl told Reuters on Monday the company was ""well-funded"", but did not disclose specific details.Scholl said Boom decided to take the lead on developing its own engines after looking at ""limitations"" of adapting a subsonic engine and the ""traditional engine business model.""DESIGN PARTNERUnder the new deal, Kratos unit Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT) will design the engine and build some of the first units.Kratos currently supplies small, high-performance jet engines for cruise missiles and drones, according to its website. Boom said FTT's engineers have also worked on advanced U.S. supersonic fighter engines.Story continuesCivil engine makers invest billions of dollars, which they recoup over the lifetime of engines through aftermarket sales.Although barriers to entry are falling in high-tech sectors such as space, analysts say it remains a significant challenge to keep up with the billions of dollars and certification hurdles required to develop a new engine for passenger use.Raytheon Technologies unit Pratt &amp; Whitney is estimated to have spent $10 billion to develop its latest engine to re-enter the civil market after a gap of several years.China remains in the early stages of challenging Western engine manufacturers with its own alternative engine portfolio.Boom will hold the intellectual property rights for the engine and will lead the program, Scholl said.The company also said 3D-printed-components expert GE Additive will be a supplier to the engine program and maintenance firm StandardAero will also be a partner.

However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Progressive's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Progressive How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.8% = US$857m ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.8% ROEAt first glance, Progressive's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 13%. Progressive was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.1% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Progressive's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PGR? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Progressive Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Progressive has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 50%, meaning that it is left with only 50% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Besides, Progressive has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 39% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 23%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Progressive's performance. While the company has posted a decent earnings growth, We do feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings at a higher rate of return. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +6.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $22.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.89 indicates a change of +13.1% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $82.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.9%. The $323.81 billion and $358.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.6% and +10.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

401,c460b40a-b92a-3ed5-be10-655a8a336e06,EL,2022-12-14,When Should You Buy The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-est-e-lauder-companies-110048747.html,1671015648,STORY,['EL'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What Is Estée Lauder Companies Worth?The stock is currently trading at US$248 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 27% compared to my intrinsic value of $195.54. This means that the opportunity to buy Estée Lauder Companies at a good price has disappeared! Another thing to keep in mind is that Estée Lauder Companies’s share price is quite stable relative to the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Estée Lauder Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 40% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Estée Lauder Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in EL’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe EL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable.

The survey also found that the ""time off tax"" employed Canadians incur has decreased for a second consecutive year.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221214005162/en/ADP Canada's Time off Tax Survey 2022 (Graphic: Business Wire)Time off tax cutAccording to the survey, the average Canadian worker is paying less time off tax with nearly a third (31%) saying they haven’t worked any extra hours before or after taking a one-week vacation. Those who clocked extra time to make up for a week off reported investing an average of 20 additional hours to prepare and return from their vacation. This represents a 1 hour decrease from last year, and 14 hours less than the 2020 average, the highest tax reported to date.A ‘staycation’ for employed CanadiansMost working Canadians (69%) say they will not travel during the holiday season, representing a 7-percentage point decrease from last year.Over half (56%) of respondents said current inflation levels played a role in their holiday travel plans.""The data from our annual time off tax survey indicates a promising shift in Canadian workers taking back their time to disconnect from work,"" said Heather Haslam, Vice President of Marketing, ADP Canada. ""However, it’s important for employers to acknowledge that vacation levels continue to fall below pre-pandemic levels and external factors can impact Canadians’ ability to take time off. Organizations that can help workers prioritize healthy work life habits may contribute to increasing engagement and employee retention levels.""Story continuesCanadian workers slowly reverting to pre-pandemic vacation habits2020 clearly marked a rupture in both time off tax levels and the number of days off the average Canadian employee took. While time off tax numbers and vacation levels slowly rebound, survey data indicates there is still work to do to ensure employees disconnect and rest.""As we look ahead to a new year, it is promising to see a decrease in amounts of time off tax and also that Canadians are taking more of their allocated time off. 2023 marks an opportunity for employers to equip employees for wellness by encouraging workers to recharge and disconnect – promoting engagement and productivity,"" concluded Haslam.Survey MethodologyThis survey was conducted by Maru Public Opinion using its sample and data collection experts at Maru/Blue November 25-27 2022 among a random selection of 811 Canadian workers who are Maru Voice Canada online panelists. The data were weighted to match the population Census data.

You can also check out our recently published article - 12 Safest Stocks to Invest In - on a related topic.Geopolitical tensions, concerns about inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve continue to make equity markets volatile. As a result, investors are bound to focus on low-beta stocks as such stocks act as a shield to current market scenario. Therefore, including some of the low-beta stocks comes as a necessity as such stocks deliver healthy returns in the long run. Inclusion of some low-beta stocks in the portfolio can make it somewhat defensive.Stocks having a beta value of 1 means that their price activity is strongly correlated with general market. If beta value is less than 1, they tend to be less volatile in comparison to general market. On the contrary, beta value of more than 1 signifies that the stock is more volatile than general market.As a matter of fact, low-volatility/low-beta stocks have the characteristics of a bond. Such stocks are typically large, and are profitable and dividend-paying firms. Such companies have mediocre growth opportunities. Simply put, low-beta stocks have characteristics of safety rather than components of risk and opportunity. As a result, such stocks exhibit higher correlations with long-term bond returns.Empirical research exhibits that low-volatility securities generate higher risk-adjusted returns in the long run. That is true because such securities usually fall less in down markets. Study by Bradford Jordan and Timothy Riley in 2016 stated that high-volatility/high-beta stocks and stocks having high short interest deliver poor risk-adjusted future performance. Low-beta premium largely depends on whether low volatility is in value or growth regime, whether past returns were high or low, and general performance of size premium. Studies have shown that when low-volatility stocks continue to have value exposure, they on average, outperformed general market by approximately 2%. When low-volatility stocks have growth exposure, they tend to underperform by approximately 1.4%, on average.Story continuesTherefore, returns to low beta anomaly are justified when low-beta stocks are in value regime, and when high-beta stocks having low short interest are excluded.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best low beta stocks to buy.11 Best Low Beta Stocks to BuyInvestments, FinanceOur MethodologyIn order to identify the best low beta stocks to buy, we first need to identify the list of low beta stocks. For that purpose we used the holdings of ETC 6 Meridian Low Beta Equity Strategy ETF (SIXL). According to its website SIXL uses the following methodology to come up with its 200+ low beta stocks: ""Stocks are first screened to remove those that score poorly on financial and growth measures. Those stocks that remain are then ranked according to their beta."" After identifying 240 low beta stocks we ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment index. So our list of the 11 best low beta stocks to buy is based on more than 900 equity hedge funds' consensus views.11 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy11. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) discovers, develops, and markets drugs for a range of therapeutic areas including cardiovascular, cancer, and immune disorders. Key focus for the company is immuno-oncology, where the firm has been categorised as a leader in drug development.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”10.

Here are the details:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles: 15 Biggest European Tech CompaniesTop 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World15 Best Electric Car Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 11 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Photos from the event can be viewed here.NEW YORK, Dec. 13, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG), New York City’s largest office landlord, together with its joint venture partners including the National Pension Service of Korea and Hines, today announced the topping out of its transformative One Madison Avenue office tower, located at the corner of 23rd Street and Madison Avenue, in Manhattan’s desirable Midtown South submarket. With construction managed by AECOM Tishman and designed by architects Kohn Pedersen Fox, the project is anticipated to be completed on-schedule in November 2023. One Madison Avenue is currently 55% leased, drawing interest from leading technology and financial service firms seeking premier office space in the heart of the city.To celebrate the topping out of the new tower, Marc Holliday, CEO of SL Green Realty Corp., Jay Badame, President, Construction Management, AECOM and Holly Leicht, Executive Director, Madison Square Park Conservancy, shared remarks in celebration of the major milestone for the Midtown South neighborhood.“With the success of One Vanderbilt, we proved that fully integrating hospitality and amenity into every corner of the building is an approach that works,” said Marc Holliday, Chairman and CEO of SL Green. “Chef Daniel Boulud will bring an exciting new French market and his first steakhouse to One Madison. Combined with its incredible rooftop venue, private dining, tenant lounge and world-class health and wellness facilities, One Madison Avenue represents leading edge curation of experiences that fundamentally redefine the workplace.”Story continues“We are incredibly excited for One Madison Avenue to reach this milestone, and we applaud SL Green, Hines and all project partners for their steadfast commitment to the Madison Square Park neighborhood,” said Holly Leicht, Executive Director, Madison Square Park Conservancy. “Those living, working and commuting around Madison Square Park can already see the significant impact of SL Green’s investment in one of New York City’s most vibrant, historic parks, and they will continue to see improvements both to the park and the surrounding business district as their vision becomes reality.”“Madison Square Park is an important resource to our entire community and I’m pleased to have the partnership of SL Green to reinvest in the neighborhood. The redevelopment of One Madison Avenue is a transformative milestone, as we look to create places and spaces that are welcoming to all,” said Council Member Carlina Rivera.“One Madison Avenue continues SL Green’s transformative vision of Manhattan East and once again we’re honored to be part of that transformation,” said Jay Badame, President, Construction Management, AECOM. “Our team has worked diligently with all of our project partners to build this tower to the highest standards, which features a noteworthy, virtually column-free design. We look forward to the completion of One Madison Avenue next year.”“We are especially proud of the design for One Madison Avenue, a creative repositioning project that complements the neighboring historic clock tower and integrates over an acre of outdoor space with exceptional views of Madison Square Park. We are thrilled to see it come to fruition as we commemorate the topping out,” said Lloyd Sigal, Managing Principal, Kohn Pedersen Fox. “We have a long, successful relationship with SL Green and are excited for this latest collaboration that will redefine the Midtown South neighborhood and raise the bar for office space for decades to come.”Located adjacent to Madison Square Park, the 27-story, 1.4 million-square-foot Midtown South office tower will provide the highest standard for today’s workplace with forward-thinking amenities and a cutting-edge healthy work environment. It will feature best-in-class amenities and wellness with the inclusion of DOAS HVAC, which circulates 100% fresh outside air and expected LEED-Gold and WELL certifications. New, oversized 9’ x 9’ floor-to-ceiling windows in the podium and a continuous curtain wall in the tower will flood every office floor with natural daylight. Oversized roof terraces will offer a one-of-a-kind opportunity to create indoor/outdoor, work and entertainment sky gardens. Additional highlights include an expansion of an already best-in-class outdoor offering with a 11,000-square-foot roof deck featuring sweeping views that are connected directly to a 7,000-square-foot tenant-only amenity space, “The Commons”.Michelin-starred Chef Daniel Boulud will open two new French culinary destinations. Chef Boulud will bring to life a European petit marché located on 23rd Street between Madison Avenue and Park Avenue South. Inspired by the open-air markets of France, the world-class marketplace will bring the height of French cuisine to Midtown South, with casual ‘cuisine de comptoir’ for convenient dining while shopping or during the workday, and an elegant Parisian grand cafe with a wide variety of selections to enjoy. Shoppers will be able to purchase the freshest seasonal ingredients from local purveyors, offering gourmet counter foods, premium ingredients and prepared meals for home as well.In addition, Chef Boulud will create a stylishly comfortable and refined steakhouse to the newly transformed tower. The full-service restaurant will feature an open demonstration kitchen format with a wood-burning grill, and a design reminiscent of old European charm, combined with the classic love for New York City steakhouses to create a welcoming atmosphere. Together, these new offerings will occupy 16,000 square feet of the building’s ground floor.Additional notable tenants include Chelsea Piers Fitness, which signed a 55,780 square foot, 20-year lease in 2021; International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), which signed a 328,000 square foot, 16-year lease in March 2022; and Franklin Templeton, which signed a 347,474 square foot, 15-year lease in September 2022.As part of the development, SL Green donated $250,000 to the Madison Square Park Conservancy, the non-profit organization licensed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to manage Madison Square Park. Jemma’s Dog Park officially opened in July. The donation facilitated the completion of a new dog run and will ensure the ongoing upkeep and maintenance of one of New York City’s most vibrant and historic parks.About SL Green Realty Corp.SL Green Realty Corp., Manhattan's largest office landlord, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is focused primarily on acquiring, managing and maximizing value of Manhattan commercial properties.

Horton and Toll Brothers,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-d-100010078.html,1671012010,STORY,"['TOL', 'DHI', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 134, 2022 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and Toll Brothers Inc. TOL.Industry: HomebuildingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2028271/2-homebuilding-stocks-to-watch-in-a-challenging-industryThe U.S. housing space continues to grapple with accelerating mortgage rates, and rising raw material and labor costs. Disruption in the supply chain has been impacting builders’ ability to deliver on time. That said, the rising need for more work-at-home space, lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been somewhat aiding the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry. Companies like D.R. Horton, Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc. have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services.The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities. The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties; residential real estate; and oil and gas assets.3 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's FutureHigher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating home prices and mortgage rates this year. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed has raised rates four times since March this year, with a 75-basis-point increment at each of its last two meetings. On Nov 2, 2022, the Fed raised the rates by 75 basis points so as to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3.75 to 4%.Story continuesAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent comment about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December 2022 has come as a breather, fears of a global slowdown and a recession loom over the stock market. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy. Rising borrowing costs and elevated risk of recession have been driving the single-family homebuilding market into recession.Supply Chain Hurdles &amp; Tight Labor Market: Supply-chain challenges are expected to continue to impact the level of housing starts and construction cycle times. Continuous supply-chain issues arising from the COVID-19 outbreak and response to the health crisis in various countries have been impacting builders’ ability to deliver on time. Rising material costs are quite challenging.According to Associated Builders and Contractors' latest analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, although construction input prices declined 0.9% in November from October, the metric was up 11.9% from a year ago. With COVID-related lockdowns continuing in China and Europe facing severe energy crises, supply chain disruptions are likely to persist in the near term as well. Again, the shortage of skilled labor continues to be a pressing concern.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Also, the majority of companies are focused on growing the demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues as well as profitability.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is a 19-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #210, which places it in the bottom 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of bleak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

If you want to read about some more best performing stocks in November, go directly to 5 Best Performing Stocks in November.After the eventful month of October, which is widely known for stock market crashes, the United States (US) stock market jumped back on a revival path in November, generally considered one of the best months of the year for investors. The relative performance of stocks during the month, compared to the year, which has been the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 in more than a decade, revived hopes of a market rally at the turn of the year. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose by more than 5% in November, up 14% compared to the beginning of October. The month of November is also renowned for Black Friday sales, a day on which big national retailers put inventories on sale. This November, on Black Friday, the shopping crowds and sales were better compared to last year, according to some estimates, although they still fell short of the traffic seen before the advent of the pandemic. Overall, sales for US retail outlets increased by 2.3% year-on-year to a record $9.1 billion. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), 196.7 million Americans went shopping over the Black Friday weekend. The NRF report claims that this was nearly a 9.4% increase from last year’s 179.8 million shoppers. Moreover, Adobe Analytics reported that online sales on Cyber Monday totaled $11.3 billion, up 5.8% from 2021 and Black Friday online sales were $9.12 billion, 2.3% above 2021’s $8.92 billion. The gain that the S&amp;P 500 registered in November brought the losses year-to-date for the index to around 14.3% at the end of November. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.67% during the time and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 jumped 5.95%.Heading into 2023, it is likely that interest rates will rise, though slower than previously expected, despite peak inflation. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which discourages companies from borrowing and investing to expand their businesses. This results in a macro slowdown for investors, and even earnings growth tends to stagnate. Some of the best-performing stocks despite these concerns in November included NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that registered a more than 20% gain in share price in November were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Best Performing Stocks in NovemberSource: pexelsBest Performing Stocks in November10.

Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.”9.

(NASDAQ:ABMD), compared to 30 in the preceding quarter worth $1.04 billion.8.

Here is what the fund said:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favour The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped-up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.”7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44     Gain in Share Price in November: 30%SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

High and rising utility costs combined with policy support are driving increased penetration of home solar plus storage systems in Europe. Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.” 6. Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45     Gain in Share Price in November: 28%Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. On November 4, Microchip Technology shares were higher after its FQ2 earnings destroyed the general agreement mark.

These products are near-ubiquitous in our daily lives, whether we know it or not. They serve as the embedded brains of all sorts of electronic devices and end products that are increasingly smart and connected to the internet, such as cars, phones, kitchen appliances, factory equipment, and so on. Importantly, microcontrollers and analog chips represent a small percentage of the end product bill of materials, yet account for a disproportionately large portion of the performance characteristics of that product. Product cycles and customer retention are very long, as once designed into a product, Microchip is rarely replaced. Growth should be well above average for many years given the increasing electronification around us. In addition, management has announced its intention to return a sizeable portion of its cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We like this dual threat of growth together with excess cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing Stocks in November. Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy20 Countries That Produce the Most Electric Power15 Countries That Produce the Most OilDisclosure.

You can also check out our recently published article - 12 Safest Stocks to Invest In - on a related topic.Geopolitical tensions, concerns about inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve continue to make equity markets volatile. As a result, investors are bound to focus on low-beta stocks as such stocks act as a shield to current market scenario. Therefore, including some of the low-beta stocks comes as a necessity as such stocks deliver healthy returns in the long run. Inclusion of some low-beta stocks in the portfolio can make it somewhat defensive.Stocks having a beta value of 1 means that their price activity is strongly correlated with general market. If beta value is less than 1, they tend to be less volatile in comparison to general market. On the contrary, beta value of more than 1 signifies that the stock is more volatile than general market.As a matter of fact, low-volatility/low-beta stocks have the characteristics of a bond. Such stocks are typically large, and are profitable and dividend-paying firms. Such companies have mediocre growth opportunities. Simply put, low-beta stocks have characteristics of safety rather than components of risk and opportunity. As a result, such stocks exhibit higher correlations with long-term bond returns.Empirical research exhibits that low-volatility securities generate higher risk-adjusted returns in the long run. That is true because such securities usually fall less in down markets. Study by Bradford Jordan and Timothy Riley in 2016 stated that high-volatility/high-beta stocks and stocks having high short interest deliver poor risk-adjusted future performance. Low-beta premium largely depends on whether low volatility is in value or growth regime, whether past returns were high or low, and general performance of size premium. Studies have shown that when low-volatility stocks continue to have value exposure, they on average, outperformed general market by approximately 2%. When low-volatility stocks have growth exposure, they tend to underperform by approximately 1.4%, on average.Story continuesTherefore, returns to low beta anomaly are justified when low-beta stocks are in value regime, and when high-beta stocks having low short interest are excluded.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are some of the best low beta stocks to buy.11 Best Low Beta Stocks to BuyInvestments, FinanceOur MethodologyIn order to identify the best low beta stocks to buy, we first need to identify the list of low beta stocks. For that purpose we used the holdings of ETC 6 Meridian Low Beta Equity Strategy ETF (SIXL). According to its website SIXL uses the following methodology to come up with its 200+ low beta stocks: ""Stocks are first screened to remove those that score poorly on financial and growth measures. Those stocks that remain are then ranked according to their beta."" After identifying 240 low beta stocks we ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment index. So our list of the 11 best low beta stocks to buy is based on more than 900 equity hedge funds' consensus views.11 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy11. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) discovers, develops, and markets drugs for a range of therapeutic areas including cardiovascular, cancer, and immune disorders. Key focus for the company is immuno-oncology, where the firm has been categorised as a leader in drug development. The company has exited several non-pharmaceutical businesses in the past to focus on branded specialty drugs.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (NYSE:BMY) Q3 results exhibit strong in-line and new product portfolio growth. The company continues to progress its product pipeline with significant regulatory and clinical milestones. It has also completed the acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics, further expanding its precision oncology portfolio. In terms of estimates, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) expects total sales for FY22 of approximately $46.0 billion on US GAAP basis, while gross margin is expected to come at approximately 78%.Analysts at Atlantic Securities initiated coverage on Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)  and increased their price target on shares of the company from $85.00 to $88.00. They gave the stock an “Overweight” rating on November 10.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) was found among the 13F holdings of 68 elite hedge funds in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $1.73 billion. The company has a strong pipeline of potential treatments for over 35 diseases. Through both acquisitions and organic growth, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) doubled its revenues over past 5 years.Here is what RGA Investment Advisors has to say about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in their third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), which we referenced above, boasts a double-digit free cash flow yield that gets divided roughly equally between repurchases, a dividend, and M&amp;A in what is the best environment for acquisitions perhaps ever. In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”10.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy. Suggested articles: 15 Biggest European Tech CompaniesTop 10 Semiconductor Manufacturing Countries in the World15 Best Electric Car Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 11 Best Low Beta Stocks to Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In addition, 37% had bone marrow plasma cells ≥50%, and the median soluble BCMA was 0.43 mg/L, representing a patient population with a higher disease burden than those enrolled in similar trials. Of the 87 patients in the 200 mg cohort, 58 were evaluated for efficacy.Recommended 200 mg dose of linvoseltamab demonstrated a 64% response rate, with 45% of responders achieving a very good partial response or better. The company expects that responses may further improve with longer follow-up.   Per Kaplan-Meier estimates, 79% probability of maintaining a response at 6 months.The phase I dose-escalation portion of the study primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities of linvoseltamab and was comprised of 9 dose-levels.  The fully-enrolled phase II dose expansion portion of the trial is further assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary objective of objective response rate.Story continuesConcurrently, the company announced positive first data from a cohort of phase II study evaluating investigational odronextamab in patients with heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) grades 1 to 3a.Odronextamab is an investigational CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge CD20 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.Data showed an 82% response rate in patients with grades 1 to 3a disease, with 75% of the overall population achieving a complete response.

The index was subject to poorer performance over the last 12 months in light of various problems such as the geopolitical issues caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflationary and recession concerns due to the Fed's aggressive rate hike stance, and the bursting of the tech bubble. However, stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 saw broader gains in November and some market strategists are optimistic about December as well. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was also quoted as saying that the central bank will now slow its rate-hiking campaign, easing pressures on the market.A few of the most famous names on the S&amp;P 500 include companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). These being in the tech sector have consistently been among the best-performing sector on the index over the last decade. Such stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 rise by about 5.4% at the close of November. The broader benchmark index ended up outperforming the smaller Nasdaq Composite index, which gained only 4.4% over the same period.While many major companies on the index are also strong dividend payers, it is not a requisite condition for a company to be a dividend-payer for it to be an attractive investment choice. Many companies may choose to reinvest their proceeds from ongoing operations into their business models to retain their strong financial performance instead of paying out the same money to their shareholders. This opens larger avenues for a company's individual growth in the long run.Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks that don't pay dividends, to recommend attractive stock picks for investors looking to invest in solid companies with long-term growth potential.

Here's what the firm said:“We also don’t invest in pharmaceutical companies. While revenue and profits are protected by patents, their future revenue depends on how quickly their drugs are copied once they fall off patent and the success of their R&amp;D. Both are unpredictable.Instead, we prefer to invest in companies that sell testing equipment and related consumables to the industry. Waters, for example, is a share that we have watched for years and would like to invest in at the right price. The company’s instruments are critical to the production and development of drugs and are the gold standard in the industry. Furthermore, they are often included in the patent applications of customers. This trust and reputation take years to build, resulting in high profit margins. At the same time, it also means that even when a drug of their customer falls off patent, the manufacturers of the generic version are likely to continue using the same instruments as these were already approved in the original application. So, the company’s revenues and profits are less dependent on patent cliffs or the success of R&amp;D than those of pharmaceutical companies.”11. Synopsys, Inc.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”9. Biogen Inc.

Under the long-established policies, workers are penalized with points for unscheduled absences, and risk being suspended or fired.The scheme came under fire during the pandemic, when industry-wide job cuts meant to bolster profits left fewer workers to manage the COVID-related cargo surge.Rail unions are protesting the lack of federal intervention on sick-time policies outside the U.S. Capitol and in cities around the country on Tuesday.On Dec. 2, U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation that broke the impasse that could have halted shipments of food, fuel and medicine, stranded commuters and harmed the U.S. economy without making any changes to sick-time agreements.When the pandemic struck and freight volumes surged, affected rail workers said those policies discouraged them from seeking medical care or taking time off to recover from illness.Under the new policy effective Jan. 1, CSX said on Tuesday it will no longer assess points when an employee calls in sick shortly before a scheduled workday with an illness for which they saw a doctor.CSX's new attendance rules will be ""non-disciplinary and non-punitive,"" the company said in an email to Reuters.Four of 12 unions involved in the latest railroad contract talks rejected a recently negotiated deal because it did not include any paid short-term sick days and failed to address the attendance points system used by CSX and the two largest U.S. railroads: Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF.Under the new CSX policy, accrued points will expire on a rolling 12-month cycle rather than accumulate indefinitely, and employees will receive credit for working without an absence and can use those to expunge points. CSX said it does not apply points when employees miss work due to hospitalization or emergency treatment.Story continuesClark Ballew, a former CSX track worker and communications director for the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) rail union, said the changes are a step in the right direction, but fall short of repairing damage from industry cost-cutting.Union Pacific told Reuters it expects to start working with unions on quality of life issues in the coming weeks. BNSF did not immediately respond to questions regarding its policy on health-related absences.On Friday, more than 70 lawmakers urged Biden to take executive action to guarantee rail workers paid sick days.Meanwhile, Canada on Dec. 1 granted workers at railroads and other regulated workplaces at least 10 days of paid sick leave annually.Canada's two biggest freight railways, Canadian National Railway Co and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, have about 10,000 employees in the United States.

OTEGLOBE is using Cisco’s new 8800 series routers powered by Cisco Silicon One to be fully ready for 800G in the coming six months.Cisco’s partnership with OTEGLOBE will help the company to spread its recently unveiled solutions across Europe and drive top-line growth.Cisco has launched its new 800G platforms, Nexus 9232E and Cisco 8111, powered by Silicon One G100 to support high-performance connectivity demands, such as bandwidth-intensive AI/ML clusters, and for the seamless performance of multi-level data center fabrics operating both in the public and private cloud.The recent partnership with OTEGLOBE is amongst its various strategic alliances with global tech companies, which will help Cisco to address growing megatrends and spread its newly launched solutions globally.Cisco Systems, Inc.

Rising inflation and recession in the United States have investors bearish regarding the performance of the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which fell 33.2% in the year-to-date period and pulled down the stock price performance of Cisco, which fell 22.2% in the same period.Further, as it ventures into new markets, Cisco is experiencing stiff competition from the likes of Wipro Limited WIT in cloud securities solutions.Wipro recently expanded its collaboration with VMware to help customers move data to the cloud at a reduced cost and operate in a multi-cloud infrastructure.Story continuesWith the recent collaboration, Wipro FullStride cloud services will be able to provide its security services to customers for no additional cost and protect data while operating in a multi-cloud architecture. This is expected to help Wipro garner more customers amid rising competition.However, as the world is going through its fourth industrial revolution, which is data-driven and a primary reason behind the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), various enterprises are investing heavily to rapidly digitize their organizations, reflecting the shift to IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).The rapid shift to these high-bandwidth and low latency applications like AI or ML, virtual and augmented reality reflects the need for 800G capacity and to connect multiple data center buildings at high data rates.Per Gartner, worldwide spending for cloud solutions is expected to reach $500 billion in 2022.

Cisco is investing heavily to build its portfolio to support cloud data centers, which is expected to generate positive ROI and win market share against stiff competition.As such, the recent partnership with OTGLOBE will help address the demand for 800G capacity across Europe.To benefit from other megatrends, Cisco partnered with Microsoft MSFT, which will bring Microsoft Teams to the former’s meeting room devices.

Globally, AI has been integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations as well. As 5G deployment increases, the real-world uses of AI in automation, cloud, and large databases, are likely to drive the demand for the new technology even further, a prime example being the popularity of smart homes and smart cities. One of the most important parts of this growth is the chip industry. According to a report by the Business Research Company, the artificial intelligence chip market size is expected to grow from $10 billion in 2021 to $15 billion in 2022, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of more than 42%. Despite supply issues due to rising demand and the global geopolitical crisis, the AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49 billion in 2026. The use of AI in fields like food and beverage development is growing too. Another important market trend in the sector, evidenced by the focus of the biggest AI companies in the world like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), is the AI-enabled industrial robotics development. AI tools are being used on social media, for big data analytics, the Internet of things, and cloud computing. The integration of these digital technologies into corporate operations, more commonly referred to as digital transformation, is on the rise as well. Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The details of each AI company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. Hedge fund sentiment is also included for further clarity on the money being poured into these firms and the confidence that elite investors have in their success. Story continues15 Biggest AI Companies In The WorldBiggest AI Companies In The World15. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Market Capitalization: $13 Billion SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) operates as an enterprise application software company worldwide. On December 7, the firm announced that UST, a leading digital transformation solutions company, in collaboration with SAP, had signed a partnership with Intel, an American multinational corporation and technology company, and a top AI firm, to assess and enable the digital transformation journey for small and medium-sized enterprises in northern Malaysia. On July 21, SAP SE reported that it had acquired Askdata, a search-driven analytics startup. The company said that this acquisition will help organizations to make better-informed decisions by leveraging AI-driven natural language searches. The users of SAP will be able to search, interact and collaborate on live data to maximize business insights. Askdata’s IP will become part of the SAP Business technology Platform and it will contribute to a next-generation lightweight analytics experience for SAP Analytics Cloud solution customers and line-of-business applications. On December 2, Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Buy rating on SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stock and raised the price target to EUR 135 from EUR 130.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) with 6.8 million shares worth more than $549.6 million. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is one of the biggest AI companies in the world. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for long-term investors.”14. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Market Capitalization: $30 Billion     Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) provides industrial automation and digital transformation solutions in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America. On November 10, ZEDEDA, a leader in edge orchestration, revealed a key supply agreement with Rockwell Automation to provide industrial automation with distributed edge management and orchestration capabilities. This automation will be provided by edge AI and edge computing. Rockwell Automation offers AI products related to industrial automation and information. For example, the FactoryTalk Analytics LogixAI module of the firm provides embedded analytics that empowers customers to apply machine learning concepts without needing expertise in data science. Applying analytics within the controller application is a new fundamental approach to achieving process improvements. Rockwell Automation is among a group of global innovators exploring how the United Kingdom’s second-largest water company, Severn Trent, can use artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies to improve the region’s environmental well-being. Rockwell also offers specialized products in cyber security, machine learning and other emerging technologies.On November 17, Baird analyst Richard Eastman maintained an Outperform rating on Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) stock and raised the price target to $265 from $250, noting that tighter integration of hardware, software and services and scalable platforms accepting of vertical-specific applications is driving broader penetration for the firm. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 35 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $768.8 million in Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), compared to 28 in the preceding quarter worth $399.5 million.In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), a Milwaukee-based industrial automation company, struggled early in the year with component shortages that prevented it from clearing its overflowing order books and rising input costs. Uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine prompted management to warn in May of lower profits for the rest of the year. Behind the frustrations, however, were indications that the business outlook remained strong, as order volume continued to grow following price increases at the end of 2021. In the recent quarter, the company reported stronger results despite ongoing supply chain issues that hindered its ability to fulfil orders. To mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, Rockwell has been accumulating inventory and redesigning certain products. We believe Rockwell will see its revenues expand as its resilience improves and supply shortages recede.”13. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)Market Capitalization: $40 Billion Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) offers internet search services in China. It operates through Baidu Core and iQIYI segments. On November 29, Baidu revealed its plans in celebration of Apollo Day to build the world’s largest autonomous ride-hailing service area in 2023.

Baidu Brain is another core artificial intelligence innovation from the company that features advanced technology for recognizing and processing speech, images and words as well as building user profiles based on big data analysis. On December 6, Capital analyst Rob Sanderson maintained a Buy rating on Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock and lowered the price target to $167 from $185, noting that another y/y decline in advertising revenue is anticipated in the fourth quarter before a return to growth in the first quarter and a 5% growth rate for 2023.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Ariel Investment is a leading shareholder in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) with 2.6 million shares worth more than $305.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Ariel Investment, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“China’s internet search and online community leader Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) also weighed on relative results in the quarter. Continuing macro headwinds driven by China’s Zero-Covid policy are resulting in sluggish advertising trends. Looking ahead, the company remains committed to sustainable, profitable growth as management works to improve overall operational efficiency, executing its strategic commitments around technological innovation and the transition to a green economy. We also continue to be enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”12. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Market Capitalization: $60 Billion   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. On December 5, Micron Technology announced that its low-power double data rate 5X (LPDDR5X) mobile memory is continuing to gain market traction with the validation of its mobile memory for Qualcomm Technologies, an American multinational corporation, the latest mobile platform for flagship smartphones. Micron’s mobile memory and storage solutions are built to fuel the next wave of 5G and AI-enabled smartphone experiences. Micron has created the world's fastest discrete graphics memory solution: GDDR6X. Launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce 3090 and GeForce 3080 GPUs, GDDR6X takes graphics to new levels of gaming realism and unleashes high-performance AI inference. Micron has been chasing maximum bandwidth memory to support gaming and professional visualization for a long time. It also includes how Micron has achieved staggering speeds with GDDR6X, the future of AI training with HBM2E, and other high-bandwidth products. On December 7, Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it would not be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Market Capitalization: $90 Billion     General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. It operates through four segments: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare segments. On November 27, GE Healthcare, a subsidiary of General Electric, introduced SIGNA Experience. SIGNA is a new platform of four synergistic transformative technologies that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning in MRI scanning. On September 5, General Electric announced the launch of its first Made in India Optima IGS 320, an AI-powered Cath lab, to advance cardiac care in India. Optima IGS 320 was built at Wipro GE Healthcare’s new factory launched under the production-linked incentive scheme in Bengaluru. The Cath lab leverages the GE proprietary AutoRight technology. AutoRight is the first neural network-based interventional image chain. AutoRight features Artificial Intelligence that automatically optimizes image and dose parameters in real-time, which enables clinicians to focus their attention and expertise on patients. On December 5, Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase maintained a Buy rating on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock and raised the price target to $94 from $89, noting that the industrial economy can show unprecedented resilience, as the supply chain is only just beginning to heal, backlogs are extended, and order growth generally remains quite healthy.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Group is a leading shareholder in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) with 13.8 million shares worth more than $852 million.  In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Longleaf Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments has strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Market Capitalization: $118 Billion Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. On November 18, Intel AI announced that it has introduced FakeCatcher, a new real-time Deepfake Detector, that analyzes the Blood Flow in video pixels to return results in milliseconds with an accuracy of 96%. Intel offers an unparalleled AI development and deployment ecosystem combined with a heterogeneous portfolio of AI-optimized hardware. Intel's goal is to make it as seamless as possible for every developer, data scientist, researcher, and data engineer to accelerate their AI journey from the edge to the cloud. Intel has acquired multiple companies across various AI disciplines. Some of the AI-focused companies that Intel has acquired in recent years include DeepMind in 2014 for $500 million, Habana Labs in 2019 for $2 billion, and Granulate in 2022 for $650 million. Intel developed oneDNN to help companies optimize computer hardware such as CPUs and streamline the development of deep learning applications. On October 31, Citi analyst Christopher Danely maintained a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $27 from $30, noting that the company announced a cost reduction plan, which should help but doesn’t help the core problems of manufacturing and wasting money on growth markets that will never pan out.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Market Capitalization: $113 Billion     Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. On December 2, Advanced Micro Devices announced the expansion of its partnership with Viettel High Tech, a member of Viettel group, to exploit a 5G network field to serve the latter’s more than 130 million mobile customers globally. Viettel is using AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC devices. AMD works extensively with the AI open community to promote and extend machine &amp; deep learning capabilities and optimizations to help to broaden the range of workloads. AMD’s ROCm open software platform is constantly evolving to meet the needs of the machine learning community. With the latest release of the company’s ROCm 5.0, developers are equipped with turn-key AI framework containers on AMD Infinity Hub, improved tools, and streamlined installation, and can expect to experience reduced kernel launch times and faster application performance. On November 14, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $75, noting that the PC segment has been early in digesting inventory and been dragging down growth, but overall CPU shipments are annualizing to about 230MM units in fourth quarter, which is far below even the most bearish market forecasts for PCs in 2023.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.99 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), compared to 87 in the previous quarter worth $4.8 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more)8. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Market Capitalization: $134 Billion  International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services worldwide. On November 14, - Infosys BPM, the business process management arm of Infosys, and IBM launched the Center of AI and Automation.

The IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite helps companies streamline and automate the management of environmental risks and operationalize underlying processes like carbon accounting.The four main goals of this suite are monitoring for disruptive environmental conditions like severe weather, wildfires, flooding and air quality while sending alerts; predicting the potential impacts of climate change and weather across the business through climate risk analytics; gaining insights into potential operational disruptions and prioritize mitigation and response efforts; to measure and report on environmental initiatives and operationalize carbon accounting. On October 17, analyst David Grossman maintained a Buy rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $140 from $150, noting that the company is defensive and likely impacted less than most large-cap tech, but not immune to slowing GDP growth.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Boston-based investment firm Arrowstreet Capital is a leading shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $515.8 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department in the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)7. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Market Capitalization: $202 Billion Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs, manufactures and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, Japan, and China. On October 6, Cisco Systems announced that the office of the UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications had signed a memorandum of understanding with the firm for a collaboration framework expanding Cisco's Country Digital Acceleration programme in the UAE. Cisco is closely partnered with Tealbook, a vendor that uses natural language processing to help procurement teams find the right suppliers. On November 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew Niknam maintained a Hold rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and lowered the price target to $52 from $54, noting that the upside from the fiscal first quarter beat is tempered by a more cautious view on a tougher macro backdrop in upcoming periods. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”6. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Market Capitalization: $219 Billion  Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide. On December 5, Twelve Labs Inc, the developer of a search platform that enables users to find moments of interest quickly in a video, partnered with Oracle Corp. to build an AI-powered model for the former. As part of the partnership, the startup will use infrastructure resources from Oracle’s cloud platform to support its AI development efforts. On October 18, NVIDIA and Oracle revealed an expanded, multi-year partnership at Oracle CloudWorld to help customers speed up the adoption of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership is another example of recent Big Tech moves to offer increasingly sophisticated AI and machine learning-powered cloud services. The collaboration will bring Nvidia’s full accelerated computing stack from GPUs to systems to software to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OCI.  OCI will add tens of thousands more NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100, to its capacity. Oracle noted that, along with OCI’s AI cloud infrastructure of bare metal, cluster networking, and storage, enterprises will get a broad, accessible portfolio of options for AI training and deep learning.  On December 5, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained an Equal Weight rating on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock and raised the price target to $81 from $70, noting that the company’s exposure to back-office workflows and its smaller but hyper-growth OCI business make sales less susceptible to growing macro pressure than other software names.   Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) with 25.9 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the biggest AI companies in the world. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest AI Companies In The World. Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

To do this, we must provide people with equitable access to the knowledge, skills, and resources needed to support themselves and their families toward long-term resilience and economic security. A big part of this is investing in entrepreneurship. Through our social investments, Cisco aims to support both micro- and small-business entrepreneurs as well as startup entrepreneurs who create jobs and contribute to community development and economic growth.U.S. President Obama designated November as National Entrepreneurship Month in 2011 to encourage more access to capital for entrepreneurs and expand mentorship opportunities, so everyone has the chance to develop innovative solutions that help people, communities, and the planet thrive.We're sharing different ways we invest in entrepreneurship, not just in the United States but across the globe in impact areas such as education, economic empowerment, and climate.Closing the entrepreneurial gap in educationCisco Foundation Education Portfolio grantee WeThrive Education works to achieve economic justice and close opportunity gaps by equipping young people from low-income communities to become entrepreneurial leaders. WeThrive founder Daquan Oliver started the first of many business ventures when he was just seven years old and quickly realized being an entrepreneur was a pathway to prosperity. In 2014, he began WeThrive to deliver online entrepreneurial education to young people from backgrounds like his.Kyle Thornton, manager of the education investment portfolio for Cisco and the Cisco Foundation shared, ""Cisco supports WeThrive in their efforts to amplify access to entrepreneurship education for youth and in particular historically underserved teens.""The entrepreneurial training program is delivered through a website and mobile app, and youth can also connect with volunteer mentors through virtual office hours. All participants receive seed funding and support toward launching their companies. Cisco's first grant to WeThrive was intended to help expand the use of its Direct-to-Youth (D2Y) platform across the United States. WeThrive recently reported that Cisco funding enabled them to reach an additional 496 students, of whom 94 percent were people of color and 85 percent were low-income. Additionally, 94 percent of participating students created a company and earned a combined $15K in real revenue; 70 percent earned a net profit.Story continuesDaquan shared, ""The social entrepreneurial skills youth gain - which they're otherwise unlikely to learn during their K-12 years - are a catalyst for reversing economic injustices by preparing them to lead a wave of economic revitalization that is owned and controlled by their communities.""Investing in impactful ideas, inclusivelyGreat ideas come from diverse lived experiences, backgrounds, and places. One of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs building great ideas into businesses is access to capital, particularly among women and founders of color. Venture Capital (VC) is famously exclusive-most early-stage VCs select investments are made through ""pattern recognition"" and warm introductions. The results are clear, with more than 90 percent of VC deployed to male-led startups and only about three percent to Black, Latinx, or Indigenous founders. Village Capital (VilCap), a Cisco Foundation Economic Empowerment Portfolio grantee, unlocks capital for startups building solutions for emergent environmental, social, and economic challenges worldwide. To help mitigate implicit bias and improve the inclusiveness of investing, Cisco is funding the design and development of VilCap's Abaca web app, with 16,000 entrepreneur members and growing.A critical insight from VilCap's design research was an awareness among investors of implicit bias and a willingness to change. As one investor said, ""I feel motivated to increase the number of investments I make in underrepresented founders but haven't been able to make that a reality in my portfolio."" Now, VilCap is developing tools to gather identity and demographic data from founders in a culturally sensitive and private manner and to visualize founder diversity in each stage of an investor's process. With better data and tools, more motivated investors will be able to diagnose blind spots and make backing impactful ideas a reality.""Cisco is supporting VilCap's work to increase investment in high potential start-ups led by women and people of color, and to strengthen the overall capacity of the ecosystem of entrepreneur support organizations that work with these start-ups,"" explained Charu Adesnik, Executive Director of the Cisco Foundation and Director of Cisco's Social Innovation Investments.Helping diverse-led startups succeedWomen-led companies receive three percent of venture capital funding - and companies led by women of color receive even less. Astia, a Cisco Foundation Economic Empowerment Portfolio grantee, transforms how businesses are funded - providing capital, connections, and guidance to fuel the growth of highly innovative, women-led ventures worldwide. Last year, Astia launched a $100M early-stage venture fund to address the extraordinary disparity in funding for companies that include women in founding or executive roles. CEO of Astia, Sharon Vosmek, shared, ""The exciting thing about focusing on solutions within the innovation economy is that entrepreneurship is the fastest path to creating a more equitable economy.""Astia is working to promote change with a global ecosystem of investors and advisors dedicated to inclusion. The organization has a strong track record of investors seeing a return and making additional investments. Cisco has provided funding to help Astia develop a tech-enabled platform to enhance how they source and screen companies applying for investment and remove bias from the investment process.

Harambe, a Cisco Foundation Economic Empowerment Portfolio grantee, identifies promising young African entrepreneurs, Harambeans, and provides them with access to training, mentors, capital, and markets, and a network of advisors. At its core, Harambe is a network that provides an ecosystem of support for the entrepreneurial aspirations of highly educated, innovative, young African entrepreneurs spearheading high-impact business and social ventures across Africa.Harambe's ecosystem of support has a multiplier and transformative effect - for each Harambean, their business, the people they employ, their communities, and their countries. Harambeans are emboldening a generation of African innovators and developing an entrepreneurial ecosystem to transform ideas into scalable solutions across Africa. Their unique differentiator is that they target support to African entrepreneurs who desire to launch business and social ventures in Africa, transforming and building Africa's future from within.Cisco has provided capacity-building support to Harambe and has also established an investment fund to support promising Harambean businesses, like MAX, a tech-enabled company on a mission to make mobility accessible, safe, reliable, and sustainable for one billion Africans.Accelerating economic and social impactCisco Foundation Economic Empowerment Portfolio grantee, Entrepreneurship for All (EforAll), is an innovative nonprofit organization with a mission to accelerate economic and social impact on communities nationwide through inclusive entrepreneurship.
