The reported figure compares unfavorably with an income of 75 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Likely reflecting the better-than-expected results, the stock gained 7.5% following the release of the results.

1,d8c4efc0-ecc2-3144-a2b9-9c8c9ab136d6,TXN,2022-11-05,Investing in Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) five years ago would have delivered you a 92% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-110015443.html,1667646015,STORY,['TXN'],"[While Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 12% in the last quarter. Looking further back, the stock has generated good profits over five years. Its return of 68% has certainly bested the market return! While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 16% drop, in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 5 years was 92%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Texas Instruments shares lost 14% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments .For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go see 5 Best Non-REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy. A well-proven way to fight inflation is to look for investments that have categorically outperformed during times of high inflation. Dividends have contributed nearly 40% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1930. When inflation averaged at 5% or more during the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, dividends contributed to 54% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500, as per Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy.Denise Chisholm, director of quantitative market strategy at Fidelity and an expert at historical market patterns, said:""Based on history, if high inflation is here to stay, I believe dividend growth stocks look likely to outperform."" According to Hartford Funds, the average dividend payout ratio over the last 95 years came in at 56.6%. As of December 31, 2021, the dividend payout ratio stood at only 31.6%, which leaves sufficient room for growth. As of September 30, 2022, 20% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index have dividend yields greater than the 10-Year US Treasury Note. Moreover, companies that boost dividends and initiate payouts to shareholders have historically provided higher total return as compared to firms that either maintained or slashed their dividends. Some of the best dividend stocks to consider include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Our Methodology Many dividend investors flock to REIT dividend stocks because they offer high yields. However, REITs are extremely vulnerable to economic cycles and have been hammered on the back of fears related to declining consumer spending, mortgage markets and housing. Therefore, our focus would be non-REIT dividend stocks in this article.We selected the following dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and dividend yields higher than 3% as of November 4. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.Story continuesBest Non-REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy12.

Here is what ClearBridge Investments Value Equity has to say about American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”11. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Dividend Yield as of November 4: 3.71%United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is an American provider of letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. On November 2, United Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) was part of 38 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 50 in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 764,900 shares worth $140 million. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”10. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of November 4: 3.46%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. October 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) declared a $0.50 per average diluted share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 19, to shareholders of record on November 11. Share repurchase authorization of $4 billion was also announced, and it is expected to be concluded by Q4 2022. Dividend per share will likely increase in Q4, and total shareholder distributions in 2022 will amount to approximately $26 billion.On October 28, Deutsche Bank analyst James Hubbard reiterated a Buy recommendation on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to 2,761 GBp from 2,779 GBp. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was part of 39 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 37 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of November 4: 4.82%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology company, operating through four business segments – Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing. On October 25, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.65 per share. The dividend is distributable on December 10, to shareholders of record on November 10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the highest yielding technology dividend stocks. On October 17, Stifel analyst David Grossman reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) but trimmed the price target on the stock to $140 from $150. IBM is defensive and likely affected less than most large-cap tech, but it is not immune to weak GDP growth and foreign exchange headwinds, said the analyst. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 funds reported owning stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of June 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $372.6 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Dividend Yield as of November 4: 3.13%AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), a UK-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and commercialization of prescription medicines, is one of the premier dividend stocks to invest in.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 18.7 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a global pharmaceutical company focused on oncology, respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolism drugs. Despite incremental positive news flow, shares were hurt by the broader flight out of European stocks and the decline in the British Pound that started late in the quarter. We retain conviction in AstraZeneca given its best-in-class growth profile combined with its strong pipeline and commercial launch characteristics. We highlight breast cancer drugs Enhertu and Dato-DXd as two promising near-term opportunities.”7.

Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.5 million shares worth $542 million. Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund has to say about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Within technology and communication services, we own a number of online businesses and semiconductor related companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments. Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions. This is because online businesses, as well as semiconductor companies, benefit from economies of scale. An online search and advertising engine will, in general, be more profitable per unit of cost as it grows larger in terms of users and advertising dollars. It is a hub-and-spoke model, in other words, where it is generally not necessary to grow expenses at the same rate that revenues grow beyond a certain threshold. Therefore, returns on capital tend to be higher, the larger and more dominant the online search company is.”6. AT&amp;T Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) sold US$11m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-110056685.html,1667646056,STORY,['WMT'],"[Many Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At WalmartThe , M. Biggs, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$140 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$141. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.2% of M. Biggs's holding.In the last year Walmart insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Walmart Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Walmart. In total, President C. McMillon sold US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of WalmartFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$3.4b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Walmart Tell Us?An insider sold Walmart shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Walmart is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Walmart you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

UAA came up with second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While revenues grew year over year, adjusted quarterly earnings declined from the year-ago period.The impact of supply-chain disruptions and higher promotions was visible in the sportswear maker’s quarterly results, as the gross margin contracted sharply.This Baltimore, MD-based player remains concerned about the tough retail backdrop and headwinds related to foreign currency. Soaring inflation is squeezing disposable income and dampening the demand for discretionary categories. Hence, Under Armour trimmed its fiscal revenue and earnings forecast.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has fallen 14.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 13.7%.Revenue &amp; Earnings PictureUnder Armour reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings of 20 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. However, the figure declined sharply from the adjusted earnings of 31 cents a share reported in the year-ago period due to margin contraction.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,573.9 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,556 million and increased 1.8% on a year-over-year basis. The metric grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis.While wholesale revenues increased 4.1% year over year to $948.2 million, direct-to-consumer revenues fell 4.4% to $577.1 million due to a 9% decline in owned and operated store revenues.

Revenues from the Accessories category declined 12.1% to $111.1 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues grew 6.5% to $33.1 million.Net revenues from North America declined 2.3% to $1,011.8 million.

Revenues from the Asia-Pacific rose 6.5% to $225.7 million, while revenues from the Latin American region grew 3.2% to $58.2 million.Story continuesThe company’s gross margin shrunk 560 basis points to 45.4% from the prior-year period due to elevated freight costs related to COVID-19 supply-chain impacts, higher promotions, an unfavorable channel mix and the adverse impact of changes on foreign currency. SG&amp;A expenses declined 1% to $594.4 million. Adjusted operating income of $129.4 million was significantly down from $188.8 million reported in the year-ago period.Other Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $853.7 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $673.4 million and total stockholders' equity of $1,816.3 million.

As of Sep 30, 26 million shares for $350 million had been bought back under a two-year $500-million program, approved in February 2022.FY23 OutlookUnder Armour now foresees low-single-digit growth in fiscal 2023 revenues compared with its prior projection of 5-7% growth due to a more challenging retail landscape and the negative impacts of changes on foreign currency. On a currency-neutral basis, management expects revenues to be up at a mid-single-digit-percentage rate compared with its previous expectation of 7-9% growth.Management continues to expect a gross margin contraction of 375 to 425 basis points compared to the baseline period's gross margin of 49.6%. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be down marginally compared with the prior year as the company manages costs amid uncertain market conditions.Under Armour guided the operating income between $270 million and $290 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $333.4 million. The company earlier projected operating income in the range of $300-$325 million.Excluding an expense related to ongoing litigation matters, the company forecast the adjusted operating income in the band of $290 million-$310 million for fiscal 2023 versus the comparable baseline period’s adjusted operating income of $424 million.

Almost anyone who purchased these for the dividend payments over the last year is now at a loss with the position.Anticipating a drop in revenue and income has REIT analysts generally reducing price targets and downgrading names. Fund investors are looking at the effects of much higher rates on financing and at the slide in value of underlying properties. None of this adds up to higher prices for real estate investment trusts, so they’re sold.AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB) owns apartment complexes in New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. , California and the Pacific Northwest. The REIT pays a 3.72% dividend.The Nov. 3 action takes AvalonBay below all of the previous October 2022 lows, setting a new low for the year. Trading below the downtrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages is not a bullish look.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) buys, manages and develops multifamily apartment communities in places such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston and Atlanta. The company is paying a 3.26% dividend.The price gapped down to a new low for the year and remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, both of which are trending downward. There’s a positive divergence on the relative strength indicator (RSI) below the price chart.Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) owns 310 apartment complexes in Southern California, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C.The REIT pays a dividend of 4.04%.The price gapped down to $60 at the opening of trading on Nov. 3, then found buying interest and managed to close at $61.38. As with the other real estate investment trusts, Equity Residential trades in a downtrend, deeply below both significant moving averages.Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE: EXR) is based in Salt Lake City and owns and operates self-storage properties in 41 states. The REIT pays a 3.79% dividend.Story continuesIt’s a strongly negative start to November for the company with new 52-week lows clearly in place — and just when, by late October, Extra Space looked as if it might conquer the 50-day moving average. Note the very large red selling volume bars beneath the first two sessions of the month.Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) is the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the country with 2,800 units in 39 states. This REIT is paying a dividend of 2.83%.This is another one where the first two trading sessions in November completely reversed a mid- to late-October rally. The company this week hit a new 52-week low on heavy volume and now goes for less than its downtrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages.See more on real estate investing from Benzinga:This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?There's No Bear Market For This Real Estate Fund...

Last year, 40% of the gas that Europeans burned originated from Russia, and the bloc shelled out $108 billion to the Kremlin.But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February forced the EU to radically overhaul its energy strategy to wean itself off Russian oil and gas—in a bid to shake off its dependence on  the Kremlin, and deprive it of energy revenues to fund its war. Over the past six months, the bloc began phasing out Russian oil and gas imports, and sought out other suppliers. In December, the EU will ban imports of Russian crude oil, and by next February, it will ban Russian petroleum products (though pipeline products are excluded from the bans). The EU has also vowed to eliminate all Russian gas by the end of the decade.But all of that Russian oil and gas needs to be replaced in order for industries to keep functioning, and people to continue heating their homes.Along with several other countries, the EU is now hoping that Azerbaijan, a relatively small country sandwiched between the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian Sea, will become an important alternative to Russian energy. EU Chancellor Ursula Von der Leyen has billed Azerbaijan as a “reliable, trustworthy… [and] crucial energy partner” that could double its gas exports to the EU in a mere “few years” as Europe tries to swiftly diversify away from Russian energy.But experts say that there are major problems with betting big on Azerbaijan. The country currently doesn’t have the supply or capacity to fulfill what it said it could deliver. And in an effort to distance itself from one autocratic regime, Europe is running into the arms of another—a strategy that could backfire given the post-Soviet state’s traditionally close ties with Russia.A new chapter for EU energy  In the search for new sources of fuel, Europe has struck all kinds of arrangements over the past year with suppliers like Norway and Algeria.Story continuesNorway is now the EU’s top gas supplier and has pledged to deliver “as much gas as possible” to bloc nations; its gas exports to the EU are up 8% year-on-year. Meanwhile the EU’s Mediterranean countries have courted Algerian gas; the North African country is set to grow its gas exports to Italy for instance, by 20% to 25 bcm this year.This July, the EU and Azerbaijan inked a new deal, marking what von der Leyen said at the time was a “new chapter in [the EU’s] energy cooperation with Azerbaijan—a key partner in our efforts to move away from Russian fossil fuels.”Brussels is billing the deal as one that will “contribute significantly to Europe’s security of supply,” according to the EU chancellor. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) pledges to double Azeri gas exports to at least 20 bcm by 2027—which would equate to roughly 6% of the EU’s gas demand—but experts have cast doubt on whether Azerbaijan can even deliver on this promise.Although its contributions are relatively small, recruiting Azerbaijan as a key energy partner is attractive to the EU for its perceived stability and the potential scalability of Azeri gas projects and pipelines.Azerbaijan—a country that borders Iran, Turkey, Georgia and Russia—routes its gas to Europe via the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the final leg of the 3,500-kilometre Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) pipeline network, which was announced in 2013 and began operating in late 2020.The country’s oil and gas production is jointly operated by its state oil company SOCAR and foreign partners, BP being the most notable. The government is unique in that it hasn’t sought to revise the terms of its production sharing agreement with international companies, making it a “pretty reliable”  energy partner for the EU, John Roberts, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Sector and a member of the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Europe’s Group of Experts on Gas, told Fortune. “Its approach has… been that when times are good, toughen up the terms for the next production sharing agreement. [But] when they are hard, ease them,” he said.Gas flows from Azerbaijan to the EU have surged in the last eight months. By the end of this year, the bloc is expected to import 11.6 bcm of Azeri gas—a 40% growth from 8.2 bcm last year. And Azerbaijan’s TAP is intended to be scalable, meaning it can double its gas transit capacity to the 20 bcm outlined in the deal, Tom Purdie, senior gas analyst and EMEA gas analytics at commodity services firm S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, told Fortune. Azerbaijan’s gas volumes aren’t enough to replace Russia’s alone—which total 150 bcm annually—but work together with other measures to remove Russian energy from the EU’s energy mix, he noted.And some optimists believe that the deal could be bigger than just natural gas. Closer cooperation between Brussels and Baku could help convert the post-Soviet state into a “key European partner,” moving it beyond Russia’s sphere of influence, Ilayda Nijhar, a political risk analyst focused on Russia and former Soviet states, wrote for global affairs think tank ODI in August. As Russia grows more isolated, Azerbaijan has become more important to the Kremlin as a trade link to Iran and Asia.Imperfect partner Still, Azerbaijan is far from the dependable partner that von der Leyen is promoting—nor does it have the necessary gas, infrastructure or funds to expand its infrastructure to deliver on its deal with the EU, some experts say.The EU’s deal with Azerbaijan actually offers “zero relief” to EU citizens “this winter or the next… and probably not the one after that either, ” Bowden said. It mostly serves as a move to show EU citizens that policymakers are “doing something,” he said.He explains that TAP gas comes from two projects at Shah Deniz—Azerbaijan’s biggest natural gas field; operators are now ramping up production to its maximum output.Meanwhile the country’s two biggest potential sources—a third development at Shah Deniz and another at the Azeri Chiraq Guneshli gas field—are “technically complex… and when any agreements are reached, will take many years to bring online,” according to Roberts. At the same time, Azerbaijan’s domestic gas consumption is growing. French energy giant Total is planning a new project that will produce 1.5 bcm of gas—but that’s earmarked for domestic consumption.“There is no immediate prospect of large-scale gas developments… between now and 2027,” Bowden said. Any major gas project—if it happens—won’t occur before 2030, which makes it impossible for the EU and Azerbaijan to fulfill the terms outlined in their July deal, he said.Azerbaijan also lacks the funds to ramp up production and infrastructure and must “invest heavily” to supply more gas to Europe, Gubad Ibadoghlu, a senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics (LSE) and senior analyst for social and economic studies at Azerbaijan’s Economic Research Center, told Fortune. And the high cost of delivering Azeri gas to Europe previously inhibited gas flows to the continent.Azerbaijan could, in theory, buy gas from countries like Turkmenistan, Iran and Russia to satisfy its domestic needs, and in turn sell its own gas to Europe. But it would still need to improve and expand its infrastructure, plus sanctions make it “impossible” to purchase from Russia, he said.Trading one strongman for anotherAside from arguments about whether or not the Azerbaijan deal is even feasible, critics argue that in an effort to distance itself from Putin’s Russia, Europe has simply traded one authoritarian for another.The EU’s new energy deal shows that it is further “entrenching itself with [Azerbaijan’s] despot regime” and continuing to ignore the human rights abuses and corruption taking place under Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev’s regime, Gligor Radečić, a gas campaigner at CEE Bankwatch, a network of environmental-focused non-governmental organizations, told Fortune.Aliyev, who has ruled the Caspian country for 19 years, continues to wage a “vicious crackdown on critics and dissenting voices. Independent activism, critical journalism and opposition political activity has been virtually extinguished,” according to advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW). Just in September, Armenia accused Azerbaijan of attacking its territory—the recent conflict killed almost 300 soldiers—a claim that Aliyev’s government refuted, but one that the U.S. condemned as “illegal and deadly.”That dictatorship could also be bad for business. Azerbaijan makes a “poor partner” for the EU in terms of quality and stability, Ibadoghlu said. “In Azerbaijan, the ruling family makes its own decisions. They can back off or postpone [cooperation] at any time due to Russia’s influence,” potentially leaving the EU in a bind, he said.Philippe Dam, HRW’s Europe and Central Asia director, warns that Europe has missed a major opportunity to place human rights at the top of its agenda with its partnership with Azerbaijan. The EU-Azerbaijan deal benefits the government, yet does not “guarantee… any human rights protection,” Dam told Fortune.“A country cracking down on its own people… is not sufficiently reliable to engage with the EU,” he said.The EU has been left with few good options. While the EU’s gas storage sites are now 95% full, the bloc could still face a shortfall of as much as 30 bcm of gas next summer, underlining the urgent need to tap alternate suppliers—or substantially reduce gas consumption, according to new analysis from the International Energy Agency. The bloc’s best bets for gas suppliers are Russia, Azerbaijan, Algeria and Norway—and with the exception of the latter, all are authoritarian states that will use gas exports as a political weapon, Radečić said.But the bloc’s diversification strategy as a whole—which includes sourcing from the global liquified natural gas (LNG) market—could “replace Russian gas volumes if all goes well,” Bowden said. Azerbaijan isn’t a “one-stop solution” for the EU, but one partner among many, he noted.Now, it’s up to investors and banks to step up to finance pipeline expansions and exploration of new gas fields in Azerbaijan. As Ibadoghlu put it: “If they do not, Azerbaijan will fail to reach its target of becoming a reliable gas supplier to Europe by 2027.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraElon Musk is facing trial again over his $56 billion Tesla paycheck that’s ‘the largest in human history’The winners of the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot will probably take it in cash.

Fourth-quarter outlooks should keep earnings high even as gasoline consumption slips during the winter.Largest U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp aims to operate its system at 93% of combined oil processing capacity, a cooler pace as it completes maintenance work at some plants. It ran at 98% of capacity last quarter.Second-largest Valero Energy plans to run at between 91% and 95% of capacity this quarter, while LyondellBasell Industries targets an above 90% rate, and Phillips 66 projects a low-to-mid 90% run rate, according to figures released by the companies.Sixth-largest U.S. refiner PBF Energy has not disclosed its plan. On Oct. 25, finance chief Erik Young said the company had the cash and borrowing power to ""operate our refining system at elevated utilization rates.""PBF restarted units idled during the pandemic at its Paulsboro, N.J., plant to produce more diesel and jet fuel, with the company's refineries running at a record-high 980,000 barrels per day last quarter, Young said.Overall, refiners are forecasting production will remain close to third quarter levels, which averaged 92.75%, said Matthew Blair, refining analyst at researcher Tudor Pickering &amp; Holt. If refiners overall hold their production flat ""that would be really strong,” Blair said.The plans reflect robust demand for diesel and jet fuel with U.S. inventories below the five-year average, said John Paisie, president of energy consultancy and researcher Stratas Advisors.Diesel stocks in particular “are well below typical levels and are running at some 20% below the seasonal average,” Paisie said. He expects utilization in the U.S. ""will continue to be relatively high and will average around 90% in 4Q.”(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

The dividend yield is 1.8% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air Sealed Air's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, Sealed Air's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 29.5% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 17% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendSealed Air Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.52 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.4% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Sealed Air has been growing its earnings per share at 33% a year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like Sealed Air's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Sealed Air might even raise payments in the future. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Sealed Air that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

This model enables the company to pre-stage crews and equipment as storms approach to enable rapid response to outages.PG&amp;E is urging its customers to take the necessary steps to be prepared and stay safe throughout the winter.Safety Tips:Never touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 911 and by calling PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights, and not candles, due to the risk of fire. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, pets and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup.Have fresh drinking water, ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer during an outage to prevent foods from spoiling. Blue Ice from your picnic cooler also works well in the freezer.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should make sure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on power lines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns. Turn your appliances back on one at a time when conditions return to normal.Safely clean up: After the inclement weather has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 811 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Story continuesOther tips can be found at pge.com/bepreparedAbout PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is one of the largest combined natural gas and electric energy companies in the United States.

The year-over-year decline despite top-line growth was primarily attributable to higher cost of sales in the reported quarter.Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP earnings in the quarter were $514 million or $3.00 per share compared with $408 million or $2.35 in the year-ago quarter.

The top line beat the consensus estimate of $2,313 million.  Region-wise, quarterly revenues were up 16.4% in North America to $1,687 million due to growth in LMR, command center soft and video security products. International revenues were up 4.3% to $686 million, as growth in video security products, LMR and command center software was partially offset by adverse foreign currency impact. Acquisitions contributed $32 million to revenues while foreign exchange headwinds were $66 million.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceNet sales from Products and Systems Integration increased to $1,529 million from $1,325 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher demand for LMR and video security solutions. The segment’s backlog was up $1.2 billion to $4.8 billion, primarily due to high LMR and video demand in North America and the International markets.Net sales from Software and Services were up 7.9% to $844 million, with solid performance across command center software, LMR and video security services. The segment’s backlog increased $0.9 billion to $8.7 billion, primarily due to multi-year software and service agreements in the Americas and the extension of the Airwave contract.Other Quarterly DetailsGAAP operating earnings decreased to $373 million from $451 million in the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP operating earnings were up to $676 million from $555 million a year ago. The company ended the quarter with a record third-quarter backlog of $13.5 billion, up $2.1 billion year over year.Overall GAAP operating margin was 15.7%, down from 21.4%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5% compared with 26.3% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in GAAP operating margin was due to higher operating expenses owing to inflated direct material costs and acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.Non-GAAP operating earnings for Products and Systems Integration were up 37.4% to $375 million for a margin of 24.5%. Non-GAAP operating earnings for Software and Services were $301 million, up 6.7% year over year, for a non-GAAP operating margin of 35.7%.Cash Flow and LiquidityMotorola generated $550 million of cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2022 compared with $1,134 million a year ago, driven primarily by higher working capital due to an increase in inventory, higher employee incentive payments and higher cash taxes. Free cash flow in the first nine months of 2022 was $367 million, down from $959 million. The company repurchased $94 million worth of stock during the third quarter. As of Oct 1, 2022, the company had $822 million of cash and cash equivalents with $6,012 million of long-term debt.GuidanceWith solid quarterly results and robust demand patterns, the company increased its earlier guidance for 2022. Non-GAAP earnings for 2022 are currently expected in the $10.17-$10.22 per share range, up from previous expectations of $10.03-$10.13, on year-over-year revenue improvement of 9.25-9.5% (up from 8% expected earlier), with a rise in both segments on higher demand.For fourth-quarter 2022, non-GAAP earnings are expected in the $3.40-$3.45 per share range on year-over-year revenue improvement of 9% due to healthy demand trends.Moving ForwardMotorola is poised to gain from disciplined capital deployment and a strong balance sheet position.

If you want to read about some more slow growth stocks, go directly to 5 Best Slow Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The United States Department of Commerce recently released advanced estimates for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the country during the third quarter, revealing that the real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.6% between June and September. The number compares favorably to the 0.6% drop in the GDP during the second quarter of 2022 and the 1.6% decline registered between January and March. Prominent growth stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been buoyed by the new figures despite a recently announced interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The latest GDP figures reflect a rise in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Eric Winograd, the director of developed market economic research at AllianceBernstein, recently told news publication Financial Times that the GDP data should give the Fed confidence that what they are doing is going to have an effect. The numbers also give credence to claims from top experts that the US economy is strong enough to avoid a recession, soothing investor concerns around a market crash and boosting growth stocks that have been battered in an uncertain macro environment. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected growth stocks that have strong chances to see their share price grow in the coming months and years. We call them ""slow"" growth stocks because their growth could be slow and face headwinds in the short term due to the current macroeconomic situation and recession fears. However, these stocks have long-term growth catalysts and positive ratings from market experts. These stocks are popular among the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.Story continuesBest Slow Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29  Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers. It is one of the best growth stocks to invest in. On September 24, Etsy advised their sellers to update their return policies by the end of October, noting there are certain types of listings where returns are not appropriate. On September 26, Etsy said it was giving coupons of 20% off to their customers to increase their sales and encourage customers to shop more.On October 10, BTIG analyst Marvin Fong maintained a Buy rating on Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock and lowered the price target to $119 from $122, noting that the company's Q3 gross merchandise volume guidance had upside and 6% sequential growth. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $595.9 million in Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), compared to 43 in the preceding quarter worth $668.5 million. Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) is one of the best growth stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We became interested in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) when Josh Silverman took over as CEO in 2017. The company had long been recognized as a great marketplace, but prior management was not focused on maximizing shareholder value. In short order, Silverman transformed Etsy from a borderline non-profit into a higher-margin, faster-growing enterprise. The pandemic helped accelerate already strong fundamental business results as millions of new customers were introduced to the platform while stuck at home. But like so many other Covid-19 “winners,” Etsy has since fallen deeply out of favor with investors, which prompted us to take a closer look. Following a 75% decline in its stock price, the company now trades for 3.5x next year’s revenue or just a low double-digit multiple of operating profit using our estimate of normalized margins. We believe this is an attractive price to pay for a unique digital marketplace with a long runway for future growth. Note that our exposure to Etsy is currently established via options.”9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. It is one of the top growth stocks to invest in. On October 14, Intel Corporation stated that it is planning to start the sales of its first six 13th Generation Core Raptor Lake processors in India for desktops with unlocked multipliers in the third week of October. It will include 23 models comprising Raptor Lake and Alder Lake silicon. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Hold rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $32 from $35, noting that the advisory expects a decline in 2023 estimates for the firm. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 65 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 76 in the preceding quarter worth $3.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V-based products worldwide. It is one of the premier growth stocks to invest in. On October 11, Broadcom added that it has partnered up with Artista, a computer network company, to announce the availability of the industry’s first open end-to-end networking solution optimized for Remote Direct Access over Coverage Ethernet.  On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Hold rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock and lowered the price target to $575 from $635, noting that there was negative risk to 2023 projections for the second straight quarter. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) with 1.4 million shares worth more than $716 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69      Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide. It is one of the elite growth stocks to invest in. On October 17, Oracle announced its collaboration with TechSee, a member of the Oracle Partner Network, to bring the next generation of visual and AI-powered service automation to Oracle Field Service to provide augmented reality guidance to agents and technicians’ mobile devices over an instant video stream.On October 21, KeyBanc analyst Michael Turits upgraded Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $80 price target, noting that the company laid out a plan to mid-40s margins and multiyear high single-digit revenue growth recently. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.2 billion in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared to 61 in the previous quarter worth $4.3 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result, plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better-than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”6. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72  Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provides reporting and analytics, and next-day settlement. It is one of the major growth stocks to invest in. On September 28, Block’s Square offered a Tap to Pay option on iPhones to millions of sellers in the US through its Point-of-Sale iOS app which allows the sellers to accept contactless payments directly from their iPhones by opening the Square POS app. On October 19, Jefferies analyst Trevor Williams maintained a Buy rating on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $105, highlighting the continued underperformance since the Q2 report that has driven the valuation near the March 2020 trough. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799.5 million. Along with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is one of the best growth stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While the integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:REGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) handily surpassed financial expectations for the third quarter.

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future.

Here are some of the biggest movers of the week. Let's kick it off with Roku. It's a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance over the last couple of days. Shares really took a dive. You can see it reflected in this five-day chart here after a wider than expected loss during the quarter.Just another company to suffer from the pullback that we've seen in ad spending. Shares hitting the lowest level that we've seen since 2019. The weak results leading to a number of downgrades on the street. Pivotal Research lowering its rating on the stock to sell from hold. Guggenheim cutting its rating to neutral from buy. The five-day move in the chart. Shares closing off just around 9%, just below 50 bucks a share.Let's move over to Peloton, another wild week in this stock, although you can see the weekly gains of just over 17%. Shares initially sold off after the company disappointed the Street with its earnings, but they were reassured by some comments that we got from CEO, Barry McCarthy. Barry McCarthy making some comments on the turnaround plan, saying that it was further along than maybe the Street had progressed, saying, quote, ""the ship is turning."" Taking a look at the week to date chart, up just around 17%. Still, though, below 10 bucks a share.Let's also take a look at Uber, another big mover earlier in the week. Shares soared after the company posted a revenue beat and strong guidance, closing Tuesday up 11% of sales during the third quarter from 72% from just a year ago. For the week, you can see a bit of those muted gains, though, giving back at the latter end of the week, with Uber closing up just around 3%, 28.39 a share.Now let's round it out with Starbucks, as we take a look at that five-day chart, up just around 5 and 1/2%, having its best day today in about six months. The stock closing up just around 8 and 1/2%, 91.86 a share. Third quarter earnings beat the Street's expectations.Also the company issuing strong fourth quarter guidance. A number of analysts boosting their price targets as a result. RBC upping its target to 88 bucks. Credit Suisse upping theirs to 105. Goldman lifting their price target to 98 bucks a share, all above where Starbucks is trading today. Again, for the week, shares closing up just around 5 and 1/2%, Rachelle.]"

Of those, 257 have voted yes to unionize, 57 have voted no, and 6 are challenge-determinative. Of those that voted yes, 248 have been certified, and Starbucks is expected to begin bargaining in good faith with the union, according to the National Labor Relations Board.However, a spokesperson from Starbucks Workers United, told Yahoo Finance in an email that ""Starbucks has not begun to bargain in good faith.""A recent release from Starbucks Workers United claimed that ""after very publicly announcing their intention to bargain at over 200 unionized stores, [Starbucks] walked out of bargaining rooms in Buffalo, Ann Arbor, Louisville, Chicago, and Lakewood, CA, yesterday due to the presence of a simple zoom room. After previously engaging in completely virtual bargaining and hybrid bargaining with no issue, the company suddenly took issue with the format, and only lasted 5 minutes at the table before storming out of the Elmwood negotiation conference room and hosting a company-side caucus for over two and a half hours.""'Direct relationship'""As you heard from the company, we truly believe a side by side relationship with our partners is the very best path forward, but we respect the [unionization] process. What we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners. We know that that has worked for the last 50 years, and we're confident it actually underpins the success of our new era of growth, so that's where we're focused, and that's where our intention is ... directly spent,"" Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.BUFFALO, NY - JANUARY 30: Michelle Eisen and Jaz Brisack chat, leaving the Starbucks Workers United organizing office after a bargaining training discussion led by Richard Bensinger over Zoom in Buffalo on January 30, 2022. (Photo by Libby March for The Washington Post via Getty Images)Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, however, disagrees.Story continues""If that were the case, then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job, and instead Starbucks is choosing to fight tooth and nail, close stores when people unionize ... We really welcome the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company and they want a seat at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected, protected, and paid what they're worth,"" she said.Henry noted that unionization efforts are gaining steam across the country.""The norm in the U.S. economy is for corporations to resist workers who want to join together and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up ... I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector, because people want to turn poverty-wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on.""Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The top line rose year over year, while the bottom line declined from the prior-year quarter's figure.Following the results, the company’s shares moved up 2.3% in the after-hour trading session on Nov 3. Positive investor sentiments were witnessed as the company reported signs of recovery in China while navigating through reoccurring COVID outbreaks and a turbulent consumer mobility scenario. Also, strong U.S. comparable sales despite higher inflationary pressures added to the positives.Discussion on Earnings, Revenues &amp; CompsIn the quarter under review, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 81 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents by 11%. However, the bottom line decreased 18.2% year over year from an adjusted EPS of 99 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseStarbucks Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Starbucks Corporation QuoteQuarterly revenues of $8,414.2 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,426 million by 0.1%. However, the top line increased 3.3% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by growth in comparable store sales and net-new store on a year-over-year basis. This and solid performances in global licensed store businesses added to the positives.Global comparable store sales increased 7% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by an 8% rise in average tickets.During the fiscal fourth quarter, Starbucks opened 763 net new stores worldwide, thereby bringing the total store count to 35,711.Overall Margin Falls in Q4On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin during the fiscal fourth quarter came in at 15.1%, down from the 19.5% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily caused by inflationary pressures and sales deleverage (related to COVID-19 restrictions in China). This and higher investments in labor growth (including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training) added to the downside. However, this was partially offset by strategic pricing in North America and sales leverage across markets (outside China).Story continuesSegmental DetailsStarbucks has three reportable operating segments: North America, International and Channel Development.North America: This segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter net revenues came in at $6,134.4 million, up 6% year over year. The segment benefited from 11% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales.Operating margin in the North American segment came in at 18.6% compared with 21.8% reported in the prior-year quarter. The contraction was due to a rise in commodity and supply chain costs (on account of inflationary pressures) and investments in labor growth. These were partly offset by strategic pricing and sales leverage.International: This segment’s fiscal fourth-quarter net revenues came in at $1,777 million, down 7% year over year. The downside can be primarily attributed to a 5% decline in comparable store sales (owing to COVID-19-related restrictions in China) and an 11% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The decline was marginally overshadowed by net new store openings (8% year over year), higher product sales and royalty revenues. The conversion of the Korean market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter-fiscal 2021 added to the positives.The operating margin in the segment contracted 750 basis points (bps) year over year to 12.2%. The downside can be attributed to sales deleverage (owing to COVID-19 restrictions in China), investments in store partners and lower government subsidies. However, this was partially offset by strategic pricing and sales leverage across markets outside China.During the fiscal fourth quarter, comps in China declined 16% year over year (compared with a 44% fall reported in the previous quarter). The downtick was caused by a 17% decline in transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average tickets.Channel Development: Net revenues in the segment increased 10% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $483.7 million. The upside was primarily driven by growth in its ready-to-drink business and Global Coffee Alliance.However, the segment’s operating margin expanded 50 bps to 50.6%. The upside was mainly driven by the business mix shift.Financial DetailsThe company ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,818.4 million compared with $6,455.7 million as of Oct 3, 2021. As of Oct 2, 2022, long-term debt totaled $13,119.9 million compared with $13,616.9 million as of Oct 3, 2021.Meanwhile, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 53 cents per share. The dividend is payable on Nov 25, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Nov 11, 2022.Other UpdatesStarbucks Rewards loyalty program’s 90-day active members in the United States increased to 28.7 million, reflecting an increase of 16% year over year.Fiscal 2022 HighlightsNet sales in fiscal 2022 came in at $32.3 billion compared with $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021.The non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2022 was 15.1% compared with 18% in the prior year.Non-GAAP EPS In fiscal 2022 came in at $2.96 compared with $3.20 in the previous year.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceFor fiscal 2023, the company anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of 7-9% target range. During the year, the company expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion.Consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 are anticipated to grow in the range of 10-12% on a year-over-year basis.

67,c677d1f6-2fd9-3396-a874-161f35828374,ADM,2022-11-05,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook ADM (ADM),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-164504983.html,1667580304,STORY,['ADM'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this agribusiness giant a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for ADM is 21.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 42.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 38.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ADM is 31.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 19.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of -3.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ADM. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made ADM a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that ADM is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.""7.

It posted better-than-expected earnings in the quarter, while its top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, sales improved year over year, driven by continued strong demand for the energy drinks category. However, the ongoing supply-chain disruptions and elevated aluminum can costs resulted in an earnings decline.Monster Beverage’s earnings of 60 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents but declined 3.9% year over year. The bottom line was impacted by inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans, shipping, freight and other inputs.Net sales of $1,624.3 million improved 15.2% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,645 million.

Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 0.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 2% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Segmental PerformanceMonster Energy Drinks: The segment includes Monster Energy drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and True North Pure Energy Seltzers. The segment’s net sales increased 13% year over year to $1.5 billion. The segment’s sales included a negative impact of $66.3 million from adverse currency rates. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment rose 18%.Strategic Brands: In addition to the affordable energy drink brands, the segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from Coca-Cola. The segment’s net sales increased 19.3% year over year to $88.8 million in the third quarter. However, currency headwinds hurt the segment’s sales by $5 million. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment increased 25.9%.Alcohol Brands: Net sales for the segment, which includes various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on Feb 17, 2022, were $26.8 million for the third quarter.Other: Net sales for the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits &amp; Flavors sold to independent third parties (AFF Third-Party Products), improved 2.1% year over year to $6.4 million.Story continuesCosts &amp; MarginsThe company witnessed a significant increase in the cost of sales, which caused a decline in the gross profit and the gross margin rate. The cost of sales of $790.6 million escalated 27.2% year over year. The increase in the cost of sales was mainly attributed to the higher logistics costs, increased aluminum can cost and unfavorable geographical and product sales. Elevated ingredients and other input costs, comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, also hurt the cost of sales.The company’s third-quarter 2022 gross margin contracted 460 basis points (bps) to 51.3%, driven by higher cost of sales resulting from the aforementioned factors, offset partly by pricing actions.In third-quarter 2022, Monster Beverage remained on track with the mitigation of higher production and distribution costs through pricing actions and lower promotional expenses. It implemented price increases for its products in the United States on Sep 1, 2022. It also brought effective price increases in certain international markets in the third quarter. These actions partly aided the gross margin in the quarter.Operating expenses grew 20.6% year over year to $415.8 million. The increase can be attributed to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses, elevated payroll expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses, and increased general and administrative expenses.As a percentage of sales, operating expenses rose 120 bps to 25.6%. Higher operating expense rates mainly resulted from increased distribution costs, and general and administrative expense rates. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were flat at 9.7%. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased 50 bps to 5.1%. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, rose 70 bps year over year to 10.8%.Operating income of $417.9 million declined 6% year over year, driven by a decrease in the gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 580 bps to 25.7% in the reported quarter.Other FinancialsMonster Beverage ended third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,030 million, and total stockholders' equity of $6,815.8 million. Short-term investments, as of Sep 30, 2022, were $1,346.8 million, whereas long-term investments were $72.4 million.In the reported quarter, the company bought back 3.1 million shares for an average price of $87.78 per share and a total value of $272.9 million. As of Nov 3, 2022, it had $182.8 million remaining under the previously authorized share repurchase plan. Concurrently, the company authorized a share repurchase program to buy back shares worth up to an additional $500 million.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, Constellation Brands STZ and Dutch Bros BROS.Coca-Cola FEMSA currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

""But the more that sell the higher the chances are that the bid will go through,"" Ingildsen said.Others were holding firm. Framtiden Partnerships which has been a shareholder for nearly two decades, said it won't tender its stake of almost 1% and hopes others would also refrain.It is still not known what activist investor Elliott Management, which owns over 10% in Swedish Match, has done.Under Swedish law, PMI needs 90% of shareholders to agree to the deal to get full control of Swedish Match.Elliott, with its stake of more than 10%, could scupper the deal if it rejects the offer.

""But the more that sell the higher the chances are that the bid will go through,"" Ingildsen said.It is still not known what activist investor Elliott Management, which owns over 10% in Swedish Match, will do.Under Swedish law, PMI needs 90% of shareholders to agree to the deal to get full control of Swedish Match.Elliott, with its stake of more than 10%, could scupper the deal if it rejects the offer. Elliot had no comment on Friday.PMI is allowed to lower the 90% threshold, but this would mean PMI would become a majority shareholder in Swedish Match which would remain listed.

AFRM is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of 65 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 44.4%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by higher transactions, servicing income and merchant growth.Let’s see how things have improved prior to the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 82 cents suggests a 105% plunge from the prior-year loss of 40 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $360.7 million indicates a 33.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 12.4%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteHigher consumer spending in the September quarter is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spendings are likely to have increased in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The sales figures from the merchant and the virtual card networks are likely to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $115.6 million, indicating an increase from $92.2 million a year ago.The consensus mark for virtual card network revenues indicates a 59.2% year-over-year rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interest income in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at $144.5 million, indicating a jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $117.3 million.The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 103% year-over-year rise. These are likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal first-quarter results. However, rising operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are likely to have boosted the operating expenses, making an earnings beat uncertain.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

(NYSE:PPG) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-inc-nyse-ppg-124204027.html,1667652124,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase PPG Industries' shares on or after the 9th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 12th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.62 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.48 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that PPG Industries has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of $115.46. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. PPG Industries paid out 53% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether PPG Industries generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 180% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.While PPG Industries's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to PPG Industries's ability to maintain its dividend.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, PPG Industries's earnings per share have been growing at 17% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, PPG Industries has increased its dividend at approximately 8.1% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpHas PPG Industries got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? The best dividend stocks typically boast a long history of growing earnings per share (EPS) via a combination of earnings growth and buybacks. That's why we're glad to see PPG Industries growing its EPS, buying back stock and paying out a reasonable percentage of its earnings as dividends. However, we note with some concern that it paid out 180% of its free cash flow last year, which is uncomfortably high and makes us wonder why the company chose to spend even more cash on buybacks. Overall, it's hard to get excited about PPG Industries from a dividend perspective.If you want to look further into PPG Industries, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces.

(NYSE:GS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $2.50 on the 29th of December, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, Goldman Sachs Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 3.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $1.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $10.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 22% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Goldman Sachs Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 14% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.Goldman Sachs Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Geographies, Khaled Al Mogharbel, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$39.64 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$51.80). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 12% of Khaled Al Mogharbel's holding.Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$144m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Schlumberger Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Schlumberger insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Schlumberger, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

VTR reported third-quarter 2022 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 76 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Additionally, the same-store NOI for the office portfolio rose while the triple-net leased portfolio experienced some weakness.VTR clocked in revenues of $1.04 billion in the third quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 billion. The figure increased 6.3% year over year.Per Debra A. Cafaro, chairman and CEO of Ventas, “We are pleased to deliver third quarter growth consistent with our expectations. Our diverse portfolio demonstrated strong performance across business lines. Notably, our SHOP same-store communities grew cash NOI 13% year-over-year, benefitting from outstanding demand and pricing power.”Quarter in DetailIn the third quarter, same-store cash NOI growth for the total property portfolio (982 assets) increased 4.8% to $373 million from the prior-year quarter.Segment-wise, the same-store cash NOI for the SHOP portfolio (320 assets) increased 13% year over year to $118.1 million. The rise was mainly backed by a nearly 17% NOI rise in the United States.For the SHOP portfolio, same-store revenues increased nearly 9% from the prior-year quarter due to the positive trends in occupancy and growth in revenue per occupied room (RevPOR). The same-store RevPOR improved more than 5% year over year. This reflected strong pricing power with solid growth in care pricing and move-in rates. The portfolio re-leasing spreads on rental rates continued to gain pace and were positive in the third quarter.The same-store average occupancy expanded 260 basis points (bps) year over year to 84.7% in the third quarter of 2022 for the SHOP portfolio. The upswing was driven by robust demand, which led to net move-ins in the key selling season of 2022.For the office portfolio (332 assets), same-store cash NOI rose 3% year over year to $123.9 million. The uptick was backed by strong performance in medical office buildings that witnessed occupancy growth of 90 bps, high tenant retention and favorable expense controls.The triple-net leased (NNN) portfolio’s (330 assets) same-store cash NOI fell 0.1% year over year to $131 million.Balance-Sheet PositionVentas exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $145.1 million, up from $127.1 million as of Jun 30, 2022.Moreover, it ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of liquidity.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 73 cents, which lies in the guided range.The total same-store cash NOI growth is estimated to be between 6% and 9%. The SHOP segment's same-store cash NOI is anticipated between 15% and 21%, based on year-over-year revenue growth of around 8% at the midpoint of the same-store cash NOI guidance range. This, in turn, set to increase on an expected rise in occupancy of 100 bps to 150 bps and continuation in strong rate growth.The office segment's same-store cash NOI is expected in the range of 2.5-3.5%, while the triple-net leased same-store cash NOI is projected between 1.25% and 2.25%.Ventas currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ventas, Inc.

(HOLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-trending-stock-130001128.html,1667566801,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +11.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -59.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +12.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -42.5%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $962.24 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -34.6%. The $3.81 billion and $4.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.6% and +5.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Is the mobile format the future of gaming?Portability is one of the most resonant features in recent years in the video game industry. It began to gain strength with the Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY) Switch hybrid console, and became a loyal companion to smartphone gamers with titles like PUBG, COD Mobile and Genshin Impact, which go head-to-head on the global downloads (and earnings) leaderboards.The ability to save a game and continue later, from anywhere, is a huge draw. And if we add this to the fact that the new devices have better hardware specifications, we are facing a platform that will surely grow exponentially in the coming years.Most importantly, some of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, such as Netflix, PlayStation and Microsoft, are already preparing to make the leap to small screens.But, what do they have planned?PlayStation And Microsoft: Console Leaders Venture Into Foreign TerritoryPlayStation and Microsoft are leading companies in the video game industry. However, our vision of both could begin to change soon.PlayStation is not only the ""desktop console"" leader. Now it is also a producer of movies (“Uncharted”) and series (“The Last of Us”), was well as PC video games and, soon, smartphones games too.For small screens, the Japanese company tried its luck with two small projects. “Uncharted Fortune Hunter,” which shut down its servers in early 2022, and “Run, Sackboy! Run!” These were adaptations of “Uncharted” and “Little Big Planet,” respectively, and both had the same concept: an endless runner in PlayStation worlds.Neither of them was a success, nor a failure, but they existed, and they were the first steps of the brand on mobile.See also: EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Meet The Mysterious $7.3B NYSE-Traded Company Behind The World's Most Important Video Games An important fact is that the release of “Uncharted Fortune Hunter” and “Run, Sackboy! Run!” came to fruition under the direction of John Kodera, former president of SIE, and Shuhei Yoshida, former head of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios.Story continuesIn 2019, when Jim Ryan (SIE) and Hermen Hulst (SCE Worldwide Studios) took over, the brand's plans changed and pointed to an expansion of media, inside and outside of video games.Examples of this are the opening of the PlayStation Studios Mobile division and the acquisition of the Savage Games studio in August of this year. The company announced the upcoming release of “a AAA live service action game,” and with the new division it expects “innovative mobile experiences based on existing and new PlayStation IPs.”On Microsoft’s side, the focus is placed on the successful Game Pass subscription service, which allows you to play a catalog of more than 100 video games on any platform: consoles (Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S), PC and smartphones (Android).In the case of smartphones, the titles cannot be downloaded, and istead must be played through xCloud Gaming, that is, through “the cloud”. With a high-speed fiber optic connection, it's possible to complete an entire campaign without a hitch.And for the gamer who isn't used to on-screen controls, official Xbox joysticks can sync up with any Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android smartphone to play Game Pass just like on a console or PC.Microsoft does not typically share the numbers of active users on its service. However, a recent report confirmed that 25 million subscriptions have already been reached: if we look at it from the outside, it is a good number; but inside the company, a higher figure was expected.See also: Xbox Bans Almost 5 Million Accounts, Takes Other Actions Against Gaming Toxicity: Reshaping The Gaming CommunityAxios reported that Microsoft's fiscal year 2022 ended with 28% more subscribers compared to the previous one. However, at the company they anticipated an increase of 73%, an expectation that was very far from reality.“We’re seeing incredible growth on PC,” said Phil Spencer in a recent interview. “On console, I’ve seen growth slow down, mainly because at some point you’ve reached everybody on console that wants to subscribe.”He did not mention anything about Gamepass on Android (xCloud).In its journey through the world of smartphones, the company's plans include the opening of its own app store to compete with no other than Google’s Play Store and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)’s App Store.Netflix Games: An Interesting Catalog Waiting For 99% Of UsersNetflix is ​​known for its streaming platform for movies, series and documentaries, but in the last year it has also moved into the world of video games.The company recently introduced the world to ""Netflix Games,"" a section available to all subscribers of its original streaming service, with access to a catalog of renowned video games, classics and some new ones, to play locally (that is, through a download) with a smartphone or tablet.See also: This Swedish Video Game Studio Wants To Bring Back 'Legacy Of Kain' And Other Eidos Franchises: Here Are The DetailsWhat does the catalog bring? Many of the titles available are of undeniable quality. We find “Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story” (a rhythm game from Riot Games, creators of “League of Legends”), “Poinpy” (from the creator of “Downwell”), “Oxenfree” (from Netflix’s Night School Studio), “Moonlighter,” “Spiritfarer” and “Into the Breach.”The move comes in a context in which Netflix lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers around the world, in the face of the appearance of new streaming platforms such as HBO Max, Disney +, Star + and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video, among others. With a big catalog of video games at no extra cost, Netflix seeks capture the attention of new users.It should be noted that the competition is not too far from the gaming industry either. Disney (NYSE: DIS) started a video game production chain for all kinds of platforms, including smartphones, and with heavyweight licenses such as Marvel or Pixar. Its last great success was “Disney Dreamlight Valley,” currently available in “early access.” However, for now, Disney is not expected to bring video games to its streaming platform.For its part, Prime Video gives its subscribers a handful of video games and downloadable content on a monthly basis.But Netflix's move has some interesting points. The company had a temporary exclusivity contract with “Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story” and took over Night School Games, creators of “Oxenfree,” to develop a sequel.The company also opened a new studio in Finland, and another in southern California with Chacko Sonny, producer of “God of War Ascension” and “Overwatch,” at the helm. Its plans point to the production of 55 games and the integration of cloud gaming into the platform.The attraction of Netflix Games is, without a doubt, in the access without extra charges, to an interesting catalog of video games that can be enjoyed without advertising.But what do the numbers say?A CNBC report highlights that less than 1% of global Netflix users downloaded these video games. The future may be promising, but it seems that the present isn’t as bright as expected.Thus, with missteps and great business successes, one thing is clear: the future of gaming will be experienced on the small screens of our smartphones.Lee nuestro contenido en españolRosin: Qué es y Cómo se Hace este Concentrado de CannabisCumbia 420: Todo Sobre el Fenómeno L-Gante, Perro Primo y DT.BilardoLuli Trujillo, la Periodista que Revoluciona la Televisión ArgentinaSee more from BenzingaEXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Meet The Mysterious $7.3B NYSE-Traded Company Behind The World's Most Important Video GamesXbox Bans Almost 5 Million Accounts, Takes Other Actions Against Gaming Toxicity: Reshaping The Gaming CommunityDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Advertising Stocks To Invest In. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, online advertising spend in 2021 came in at $189.3 billion, about 2.7-times ahead of the spending on TV ads, which stood at $69.7 billion. In 2022, PwC expects that online advertising spending will climb to $218 billion, essentially tripling the TV ad spend, which is forecasted to experience a slow growth rate. Latest estimates, assuming a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.99% from 2021 through to 2026, expect the online advertising market in the US to reach $278 billion. By 2026, the dollar spend on online advertising is predicted to be over 3.8-times that of TV advertising spend.However, big tech is making moves that will impact the advertising world directly, in addition to inflation and consequent budget cuts hammering the industry. Privacy changes like Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency policy will not allow advertisers to track users on iOS and disrupt monetization and measurement of data insights. Resultantly, Meta announced that these privacy changes could cost the company about $10 billion in 2022, and since it failed to provide a similar replacement, advertisers are leaving Facebook. This will highly affect Meta’s annual growth rate of ad revenues. While the industry goes through big changes, valuations become attractive and investors should look into picking up notable advertising stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Our Methodology We selected the following advertising stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong hedge fund sentiment as of June 2022.

Instead of advertisers having to rely on each platform’s (Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.) own unique metrics and manually trying to aggregate them into a cohesive reporting framework, DoubleVerify’s software accomplishes this in one single solution. It uses its own measurement and analytics across the advertising ecosystem, providing brands with consistency and standardization in measuring the efficacy of their digital advertising spend. This helps solve a critical problem for brands and ultimately helps drive their future ad buying decisions, which can be particularly difficult when &gt;40% of digital ads are never seen,&lt;5% receive more than two seconds of engagement and 15%-20% of impressions are fraud where bots emulate human views.

(NASDAQ:MGNI) will serve as a sell-side advertising platform connected to the OneFOX inventory.On August 10, Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil reiterated a Positive rating on Magnite, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGNI) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $13 from $24. The analyst noted that Magnite, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGNI) reported a solid Q2, with CTV exceeding forecasts despite macro headwinds. He said although the guidance was a bit lower due to the tough macro, most of the softness is from desktop, not CTV.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 23 hedge funds were bullish on Magnite, Inc.

The technology helps publishers such as network television stations or cable news providers automate the sale of digital advertising inventory across different formats and channels, like desktop, mobile, video, audio, connected TV and over-the-top TV. Publishers monetize their digital advertising inventory by using Magnite’s platform to access a global market of ad buyers, including advertising agencies that use supply side platforms. Magnite also helps sellers decrease costs and protect their brands and user experience. Magnite receives ad inventory from sellers and optimizes publishers’ revenue yields by processing the highest buyer bids. Currently, Magnite keeps approximately 10% of ad spend as revenue (i.e. take rate) and passes on the remainder of the ad spend to publishers. Magnite’s clients include many of the world’s leading publishers of websites and mobile applications and the company believes that its platform reaches approximately 1 billion individuals globally.Shares of Magnite underperformed in the second quarter due to the growth market selloff and slower-than-expected growth in connected TV during the first three months of this year. We believe the 32% growth in connected TV was below expectations and due to a one-time issue with one of the company’s publishing partners that ran out of advertising inventory. Management noted the issue has been fixed and the company saw strong reaccelerating growth in April. Additionally, we believe Magnite’s recent acquisition of video advertising company SpotX will significantly bolster the company’s positioning within connected TV, a high-growth area of the digital advertising market that is taking share from linear TV ad budgets.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Advertising Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:11 Best Midcap Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Safe Stocks To Invest In10 Cheap Penny Stocks To Buy Now Disclosure: None. 11 Best Advertising Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.""7.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Macy's (M) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.22 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 17, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.22 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.19 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Macy's has an Earnings ESP of 18.92%.M is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.O'Reilly Automotive is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 8, 2023. ORLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.71 a share 96 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for O'Reilly Automotive is $7.60, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.46%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, M and ORLY could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at General Dynamics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics What's The Opportunity In General Dynamics?Good news, investors! General Dynamics is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $409.98, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. General Dynamics’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will General Dynamics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 34% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for General Dynamics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

101,e7256381-ab69-3221-8d0c-1dd9b9d86432,GD,2022-11-05,3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Watch as U.S. Dollar Rallies,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-aerospace-defense-stocks-watch-143102578.html,1667572262,STORY,"['GD', '^GSPC']","[A strengthening U.S. dollar, on top of the ongoing rising inflation, has been burdening airlines, hurting the prospects of aerospace-defense stocks that are more engaged in commercial aerospace-related operations. Nevertheless, increased spending by global air tourists as projected by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in June is expected to aid commercial jet makers. Yet pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to stocks in the aerospace-defense space. Still, recovering air traffic trends should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are General Dynamics GD, Archer Aviation ACHR and Spire Global SPIR.  About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) this June, tourists traveling by air globally in 2022 are projected to spend $672 billion – a sizable increase of 78.2% from the 2021 figure. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace giants, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Story continuesExpanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. House passed the $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act this July, thereby authorizing the U.S. government to spend $37 billion more than what President Joe Biden had requested in his budget for national security spending. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. In this context, management of Boeing stated in a Reuters report that the company expects supply chain problems to persist almost until the end of 2023, led by labor shortages at mid-tier and smaller suppliers, partly due to the faster-than-expected return of demand. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #89, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats S&amp;P 500, Lags SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite but underperformed its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8.2% compared with the Aerospace sector’s decline of 5.4%. In contrast, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has gone down 21.3% in the said timeframe.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for valuing capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.96, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.18 and the sector’s 2.26.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.96X, as low as 1.34X, and at the median of 1.64X, as the charts show below.EV-Sales Ratio TTM3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep in Your WatchlistArcher Aviation: Based in San Jose, CA, Archer Aviation is involved in designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for use in urban air mobility. The company recently announced that it will launch its first electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft named Midnight at an Open House event on Nov 16, 2022. With the rapidly growing demand for eVTOL aircraft in air transportation, such a product innovation should bolster ACHR’s position in the concerned market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Archer Aviation’s 2022 loss implies a solid improvement from the 2021 reported figure. ACHR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Price &amp; Consensus: ACHRSpire Global: Based in Vienna, VA, Spire Global is a provider of space-based data, analytics and space services. Earlier this month, the company won a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to deliver a preliminary design for a satellite that would carry an array of sensors to very low Earth orbit for in-situ ionosphere measurements. With the U.S. government emphasizing on space exploration and associated development, this contract win should position Spire Global at an advantageous place in the expanding space market.Spire Global currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.9%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 35.71% in the last reported quarter.  SPIR currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this defense contractor have returned +11.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which General Dynamics falls in, has gained 15.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.General Dynamics is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.16 points to a change of +5.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.06 indicates a change of +15.6% from what General Dynamics is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Dynamics.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GD _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For General Dynamics, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $39.38 billion and $42.34 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +7.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Dynamics reported revenues of $9.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. EPS of $3.26 for the same period compares with $3.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.56%. The EPS surprise was +3.16%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Dynamics is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Dynamics. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NRG is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 7, before market open. NRG Energy witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 6.45% in the last reported quarter.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming earnings announcement.Factors to ConsiderNRG Energy’s third-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from warmer-than-normal temperature in service territories, creating demand for utility services.NRG Energy’s quarterly earnings are likely to have benefited from ongoing share repurchases, which have reduced its outstanding shares.The extended outage of W.A. Parish Unit 8 has no doubt impacted the performance in the third quarter.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at 64 cents, indicating a 90.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $5.9 billion, indicating a 10.7% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NRG Energy this time.

106,a5f0fd19-fa41-3e09-a384-43d69775eb93,NRG,2022-11-05,Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/algonquin-power-utilities-aqn-earnings-140002029.html,1667570402,STORY,"['AQN.TO', 'AQNU', 'NRG']","[The market expects Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (AQN) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 11, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%.Revenues are expected to be $614.83 million, up 16.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.89% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities?For Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.16, delivering a surprise of +6.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerNRG Energy (NRG), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.64 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -90.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.9 billion, down 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for NRG has been revised 237.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NRG will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

107,2f9328e9-c828-3b61-9af0-d20cab932d57,NEE,2022-11-05,7 Clean Energy Stocks to Buy for 2023 and Beyond,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-clean-energy-stocks-buy-144545406.html,1667486745,STORY,"['BEP', 'ORA', 'NEE-PR', 'ENPH', 'BE', 'SPWR']","[Fundamentally, it’s quite possible that the discussion centering on clean energy stocks to buy represents an ignorable topic. At its core, the underlying energy initiative concentrates on the growing concerns regarding climate change. We already see the economic consequences of climate dynamics such as rolling blackouts. To prevent greater catastrophes, though, a serious transition must take place.Another paradigm that rattled investors into seeking clean energy stocks to buy targets geopolitical challenges. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its blackmailing of hydrocarbon outflows dominates headlines, the greater lesson is this: western countries and their allies cannot depend on politically unstable administrations for their core energy needs.To be fair, even the best clean energy stocks to buy feature a mix of financial opportunities and challenges. Nevertheless, over the long run, broader fundamentals may open doors to significant upside. With that in mind, here are compelling market ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEENextEra Energy$77.50ENPHEnphase Energy$298.64BEPBrookfield Renewable$28.98BEBloom Energy$17.43SPWRSunPower$17.86ORAOrmat Technologies$94.66SMRNuscale Power$11.55NextEra Energy (NEE)electricity pylons and lines at duskSource: snvv18870020330 / Shutterstock.comBased in Juno Beach, Florida, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization. At the moment, its market value stands at $152.37 billion. On a year-to-date basis, NEE held up relatively well, a strange thing to say about a loss of nearly 16%. However, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 shed nearly 22% during the same period.On a technical level, NEE shares have been trading flat since the end of 2020. It’s possible that traders could be setting up a baseline before swinging dramatically higher in 2023. Adding to this speculation, Reuters reported that NextEra “whizzed past estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday on strong demand amid surging power prices, while predicting a boost from the recent anti-inflation act.”Story continuesBased on proprietary calculations, Gurufocus.com reckons that NEE represents a modestly undervalued business. Against traditional metrics, investors should note the company’s net margin of 19.3%. In sharp contrast, the industry median is only 8.1%, meaning that NEE ranks above nearly 84% of its peers. Therefore, NEE is one of the top clean energy stocks to buy.Enphase Energy (ENPH)rows of solar panels representing EOSE Stock.Source: Love Silhouette / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Fremont, California, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is an American energy technology company. It develops and manufactures solar micro-inverters, battery energy storage, and electric vehicle charging stations primarily for residential customers. At the time of writing, ENPH features a gain of 57% YTD. Its market cap stands at over $40.76 billion.Fundamentally, Enphase benefits cynically from rolling blackouts that plagued states like California throughout the new normal. With (wealthier) households recognizing their own vulnerabilities to the power grid, Enphase should enjoy expanded demand. To be fair, investors will be paying more than 53-times forward earnings for the privilege. Still, dynamics such as climate change may force consumers’ hands.Not surprisingly, Enphase delivers the goods in terms of growth. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 45%, beating out more than 98% of its peers. As well, the company enjoys a strong profitability record, leading to a return on equity of 60%. This signifies an extremely high-quality business, making ENPH one of the best clean energy stocks to buy.Brookfield Renewable (BEP)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb conceptSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comBased in Bermuda, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) owns and operates renewable power assets. Per its website, Brookfield operates one of the world’s largest publicly traded, pure-play renewable power platforms. At the moment, BEP shares fell almost 19%, which again isn’t that bad compared to the S&amp;P 500’s losses. Further, BEP features a market cap of 10.98 CAD (roughly $8.02 billion).To be completely transparent, BEP has been trending downward since January 2021. Therefore, it needs a spark to get the ball rolling again. Fundamentally, that could arrive in the form of climate change dynamics, geopolitical pressures, or a combination of the two. Notably, Gurufocus.com labels Brookfield as a modestly undervalued business. Against traditional metrics, BEP’s price-to-sales ratio is just under 2 times. In contrast, the underlying industry features a median level of 3.5 times. Another factor to consider for investors seeking clean energy stocks to buy is that Brookfield’s operating margin stands at 27%, better than 70% of its peers.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) manufactures and markets solid oxide fuel cells that produce electricity on-site. Per its public profile, its fuel cells are subsidized by government incentive programs for green energy. Presently, Bloom Energy features a market cap of $3.4 billion. Since the beginning of the year, BE gave up about 22% of its equity value.Generally speaking, Bloom brings much potential to the table; it’s just that Wall Street so far doesn’t consistently recognize the opportunity. Based on data from Google Finance, BE’s lifetime return at the time of writing sits at 23% below parity. Fundamentally, though, increased demand for clean energy stocks to buy may lift all proverbial boats.Financially, Gurufocus.com labels BE as a modestly undervalued investment based on proprietary calculations. Against traditional metrics, investors will take comfort in certain growth stats. For instance, Bloom’s three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 37.7%, higher than over 79% of its peers.SunPower (SPWR)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Jose, California, SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) is a provider of photovoltaic solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products, primarily for residential customers. At the moment, SunPower features a market cap of exactly $3 billion. Since the start of the year, SPWR shed 20% of equity value. On the Nov. 2 session, SPWR dropped almost 6%, implying a discount for contrarian speculators.Technically speaking, SPWR peaked in January 2021. Since then, shares appear to be forming a rounding bottom, suggesting a turnaround, perhaps in 2023. Fundamentally, this projection would make sense. As mentioned earlier, households recognize the value of systems that facilitate greater energy resilience. In addition, the cost savings may be attractive under this pensive economic environment.Financially, Gurufocus.com labels SPWR as modestly undervalued based on proprietary calculations. For investors using traditional assessments, they should consider its three-year FCF growth rate of just under 60%. This ranks above nearly 85% of the competition, making BE one of the more attractive clean energy stocks to buy.Ormat Technologies (ORA)Man in blue shirt presents open hand with bulb concept floating above palm, innovation background.Source: ShutterstockBased in Reno, Nevada, Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA) supplies alternative and renewable geothermal energy technology. As of January 2021, it owns and operates 933 megawatts of geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants. Currently, Ormat commands a market cap of $4.94 billion. Since the January opener, ORA swung up 12.5%.Technically, Ormat represents a slow-and-steady bullish case among clean energy stocks to buy. Over the trailing five-year period, ORA gained over 36% of equity value. Fundamentally, geothermal energy solutions bring a compelling narrative to the mix. Essentially harnessing the power of the earth’s core, the energy outflow is practically limitless.To be fair, though, narratives don’t always align with the financials. According to Gurufocus.com, ORA rates as modestly overvalued. Currently, traders pay 52.3-times forward earnings. Also, the balance sheet could use some shoring up, with the Altman Z-Score of 1.74 tilting toward the wrong direction of the stability spectrum. Still, the scientific proposition of geothermal may be attractive enough for some speculators.NuScale Power (SMR)clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in BelgiumSource: engel.ac / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Portland, Oregon, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) designs and markets small modular reactors (SMRs), which represent nuclear facilities featuring a smaller physical footprint. Per its corporate profile, NuScale received approval to build reactors in Idaho, in 2029 and 2030. Presently, it carries a market cap of $2.52 billion. Since the start of the year, shares gained 13%.While nuclear power generates some controversy, it’s important to remember that it’s a zero-emission solution. Further, nuclear’s land footprint is relatively small. And with NuScale’s SMRs, that footprint will become even smaller. Indeed, NuScale represents one of the best clean energy stocks to buy because it can deliver energy supplies closer to the source of demand.Admittedly, from a financial perspective, the framework for SMR stock remains speculative. It may be a long time before NuScale achieves consistent profitability. At the same time, investors should note that it enjoys a solid balance sheet. Primarily, the company features no debt, affording it tremendous flexibility.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Masco's shares before the 9th of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 28th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.28 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.12 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Masco has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current stock price of $43.55. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Masco Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Masco's payout ratio is modest, at just 33% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Masco generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 38% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Masco's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 21% per annum for the past five years. Masco is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Masco has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Masco an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Masco has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Masco is facing. For example, Masco has 3 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

110,ae429d03-4068-3db5-bf8e-50b16ace9fa0,MA,2022-11-05,Affirm (AFRM) to Post Q1 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/affirm-afrm-post-q1-earnings-164604395.html,1667580364,STORY,"['MA', 'V', 'WU']","[Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of 65 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 44.4%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by higher transactions, servicing income and merchant growth.Let’s see how things have improved prior to the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 82 cents suggests a 105% plunge from the prior-year loss of 40 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $360.7 million indicates a 33.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 12.4%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteHigher consumer spending in the September quarter is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spendings are likely to have increased in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The sales figures from the merchant and the virtual card networks are likely to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $115.6 million, indicating an increase from $92.2 million a year ago.The consensus mark for virtual card network revenues indicates a 59.2% year-over-year rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interest income in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at $144.5 million, indicating a jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $117.3 million.The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 103% year-over-year rise. These are likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal first-quarter results. However, rising operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are likely to have boosted the operating expenses, making an earnings beat uncertain.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of 82 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the September quarter: Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.68 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%. The quarterly results were driven by improved consumer spending, recovery in cross-border travel, higher gross dollar volume and increased switched transactions. However, the upside was partly offset by Mastercard’s rising operating expenses.Visa reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.93 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86. The quarterly results were aided by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. However, Visa’s elevated operating costs partly offset the upside.Western Union reported third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 42 cents, which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The share price has now given up all its gains since February 2019, which at one point amounted to 775%Revenue for the third quarter was $761 mln, up 12% from a year ago and well ahead of consensus estimates - although those estimates have been lowered significantly over the last few months. On a GAAP basis, the company lost $0.88 a share, which was also much better than expected but compared to positive $0.52 a year ago.Total net revenue for the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $800 mln, versus estimates of $884 mln (that were closer to $1.2 bln a few months ago).Our take: There wasn’t much to like about these results, and the immediate future looks bleak. However, there was one metric that is encouraging and worth keeping an eye on going forward.During the last quarter,Active users increased 16% YoY to 65.4 millionTotal hours streamed increased 21% YoY to 21.9 billionThe average revenue per user increased 10% YoY to $44.25The increase in active users isn't very exciting, and the increase in ARPU was disappointing. But the total hours streamed continues to rise and it's been rising all year despite the end of lockdown restrictions.Ad spending is under pressure at the moment, so Roku has obviously struggled to monetize the increase in viewing hours. But the total number of streaming hours will be important when ad spend does begin to increase again. As consumers switch from cable TV to streaming services, advertisers have limited options - and Roku is one of those options.Story continuesOur full analysis of ROKU provides a more comprehensive picture of the company’s financials and several risks to be aware of.Etsy is doing well given the current environmentShares of Etsy ( Nasdaq: ETSY ) traded as much as 16% higher on Thursday after the e-commerce platform announced better-than-expected sales and raised guidance. Gross merchandise value of $3 billion was down 3.3% YoY, while revenue of $594 mln was 11.7% higher than a year ago. The net loss widened to $963 mln due to an impairment charge.The good news came in the form of guidance for the fourth quarter as the company expects GMV to increase to between $3.6 and $4 bln.Revenue rose while gross merchandise sales were flat. This was partly a result of raising the commission Esty charges on transactions, but also due to additional services it provides to customers.Our take: Etsy’s GMV, revenue, and net income have been relatively flat over the last two years. The jump in the share price was a response to the company beating very low expectations.But Etsy did provide some encouraging data which shows that the company is building a loyal customer base.Nasdaq: ETSY KPIs - Company presentationThese numbers suggest that customers are more engaged but are now spending less on each transaction. This makes sense when we consider the effect of inflation on discretionary budgets.Etsy is a unique platform with a loyal customer base. It's probably going to struggle to grow in the current economic environment but will be a company to watch when conditions change.Have a look at the  full analysis of Etsy for more details.Qualcomm sinks on falling smartphone demandQualcomm ( Nasdaq: QCOM ) reported mixed results, but also lowered guidance for the current quarter. The share price fell 7.45% in response, and it's now down 25% over the last 12 months, and 43% year to date.Quarterly sales of $11.4 bln were up 22.1% from a year ago and ahead of consensus estimates. Non-GAAP EPS were also up 22% to $ 3.13 which is what analysts expected. GAAP EPS were lower than expected and only 3.8% higher than a year ago.The company now expects first-quarter revenue of $9.2 to $10 bln, compared to the previous estimate of 12.05 bln. The company also said that smartphone demand was falling and that customers are drawing down on inventory as supply chain restraints have eased.Our take: Qualcomm stands out amongst its peers due to its strong cash flows and 2.9% dividend yield. The company has managed to increase its dividend every year for the last decade - but you may be wondering how sustainable it is if the company experiences an ongoing slowdown.The payout ratio is currently 24% of earnings and 49% of cash flow. Free cash flow has already fallen quite a lot over the last year - but the dividend coverage still appears to be sustainable. It would take a very dramatic drop in cash flow to put the current yield at risk.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

114,85e18ee8-b5f1-3aaf-8377-548fd9570f39,QCOM,2022-11-05,15 Most Innovative Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-innovative-companies-world-143208400.html,1667572328,STORY,"['INTC', 'NVDA', 'IBM', 'BABA', 'QCOM', 'TSM', 'ASML', 'TSLA']","[In this article, we will take a look at 15 of the most innovative companies in the world. If you want to see more of the most innovative companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Innovative Companies in the World.When most people think of innovation today, they think of computer technology or information technology.Many of the world's most valuable companies are computer technology or information technology companies. Companies like Apple and Microsoft are worth trillions of dollars. Companies like Apple and Microsoft also make some of today's most useful products such as smartphones or computer operating systems.Given their past history of making very useful and innovative products, it's likely that the leading computer technology or information technology companies will make very useful and innovative products in the future too.Improving SemiconductorsOne reason for why the computer technology sector has been so innovative is due to semiconductor chips becoming more efficient over time.Intel describes the trend otherwise known as Moore's law, ""From careful observation of an emerging trend, Moore extrapolated that computing would dramatically increase in power, and decrease in relative cost, at an exponential pace. The insight, known as Moore’s Law, became the golden rule for the electronics industry, and a springboard for innovation.""As a result of cheaper semiconductors, computers and smartphones became more affordable and more people were able to purchase them. With more computer and smartphone users, many information technology companies were able to gain more users for their internet services and apps. With the information technology companies having more resources, they were able to create innovative online services and apps that offered more utility. With more useful online services and apps, more people bought computers and smartphones. This cycle helped power innovation in the industry for decades.Although Moore's law has helped the computer industry innovate for multiple decades in the past, making faster and cheaper semiconductors at the rate described by Moore's law isn't possible due to physics currently.Story continuesAs a result, the computing industry has had to look for other ways of increasing computing speed including investing substantial capital into developing quantum computing. Although there is no guarantee that developing quantum computing will succeed, a breakthrough in terms of developing the technology could help fuel innovation for years to come.2022Due to high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times this year and the market has declined fairly substantially as a result.The tech sector has also been negatively affected by the interest rate increases given that the NASDAQ has declined almost 35% year to date. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to buy a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in 2021Dragon Images/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list, we took the top 50 companies from companiesmarketcap.com's Top publicly traded tech companies by revenue and picked 15 very innovative companies from that list that help make semiconductors or were leading information technology companies. We then ranked the 15 by revenue according to companiesmarketcap.com.Given that the level of innovation is subjective and there are many innovative companies both inside the tech sector and also in other sectors, our list is subjective.15 Most Innovative Companies in the World15. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes leading lithography systems needed to make the world's most advanced semiconductors. Given the company has spent multiple decades on R&amp;D for its state of the art lithography systems, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has a very wide moat. Some analysts think it could take multiple years for competitors to catch up. Given its importance, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has lately been affected by the U.S. China semiconductor tensions and its stock is down 45% year to date.14. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn't always worth more than its competitor Intel. In fact, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was worth only a fraction of Intel several years ago. Given that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are better for AI and machine learning in some ways than Intel's semiconductor chips are, however, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has surged as the market has priced in substantial future growth in the company's future.Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”13. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading semiconductor producer for smartphones. With the growth in demand for smartphones, demand for QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s semiconductors has increased substantially in the last ten years. Given its scale, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is investing substantial capital to remain on the cutting edge.12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the leaders in AI and also quantum computing. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) describes its quantum computing efforts, ""IBM Quantum leads the world in quantum computing. This nascent technology is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s most powerful classical supercomputers cannot solve and never will."" If it is successful in commercializing the technology, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and the world could realize substantial benefits.11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading semiconductor maker that operates at the very cutting edge in terms of producing the smallest and arguably most efficient semiconductors. With its foundry business model, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures semiconductors for other companies who design them. Given U.S. China tensions, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) could be affected by geopolitics.10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is no longer the leader in the semiconductor industry given its competitor's success in terms of manufacturing semiconductors. Nevertheless, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has substantial financial resources and the company is committed to try to regain the lead. Over the past few years, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has spent tens of billions in terms of R&amp;D, and the company plans to spend tens of billions more.9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Although Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s main product is electric cars, the company is arguably a computer technology company given that it has invested substantial capital to try to make autonomous driving possible. If it commercializes autonomous driving in the way the market expects, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) could have considerable more revenue growth in the future. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also working on developing robots that could do a variety of different things.8. TencentTencent is a very innovative tech company based in China given that it was arguably the first company to create the super app in WeChat, which offers many different useful services all in one app. After buying Twitter, Elon Musk is perhaps deciding to try and duplicate many of WeChat's features. Forbes writes, ""As a model, Musk has set at least some sights on the original so-called super app, WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent. In Musk’s first town hall meeting with Twitter employees last week, he directly mentioned WeChat, indicating that building something like it would further his broader goal of nearly quintupling Twitter’s user base to a billion people.""7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Although its metaverse investment isn't going very well currently, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is nevertheless a very innovative company given its substantial investments in AI. In terms of the future, there's also potential for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) if its metaverse product improves. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has already spent $15 billion on the metaverse and the company plans to invest tens of billions more.6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)As one of China's leading tech companies, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has substantial revenues and spends a substantial amount on research and development. According to macrotrends.net, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) spent $8.74 billion in R&amp;D for 2021, up from $6.09 billion in 2020. With the R&amp;D, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) could potentially create new innovative products and services. Given U.S. China tensions and delisting fears, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares have fallen 45% year to date.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Starbucks SBUX, DoorDash DASH, Expedia EXPE, Block SQ and PayPal PYPL.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Big Late-Market Moves on Q3 Reporting NumbersThursday's trading session was a tad bipolar, closing on a big skid downward, though off session lows struck early this morning across the board, with a surge toward the green in between. Along with digesting the Fed's slightly more dovish monetary policy statement and Fed Chair Powell's hawkish talk-down directly following, and the upcoming midterm elections next week (results of which, given recent trends, we might not get on the night-of), there are plenty of questions currently left unanswered. We also got another huge slab of Q3 earnings reports out after the closing bell.The Dow slipped another -146 points, -0.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 saw 6 of 112 sectors lower and the index was down -1.06% on the day. The Nasdaq continues to suffer its worst trading week since January, down almost -7% and -1.73% today, and the Russell 2000 dipped another -0.53% on the session. Investors appear in search of new equilibrium, which it may not get until sometime after midterm elections are resolved.Starbucks reported +84 cents per share which outpaced the Zacks consensus by 8 cents, on $8.41 billion in sales which was slightly lower than the $8.43 billion expected. Global same-store sales easily outperformed expectations, +7% versus the estimate +4.2%, as International revenues were better than expected. China alone surprised to the upside, -16% in the quarter instead of the -25% anticipated. Shares were up +3% in late trading.DoorDash performed even better in the after-market, +14% following its Q3 report: while its bottom line missed expectations, coming in at -77 per share versus -60 cents estimated, revenues of $1.70 billion were well ahead of the $1.64 billion analysts were looking for. Orders came in ahead of expected, and Q4 guidance — on both Marketplace GOV and EBITDA, two important metrics in the delivery business — was increased on both. The post-market gains follow +5.5% in the regular trading session.Story continuesExpedia swung to a negative initially on the news from its Q3 report, which posted earnings of $4.05 per share versus $3.89 in the Zacks consensus on record-high revenues of $3.62 billion in the quarter, outpacing the $3.55 billion expected. Gross bookings grew +28% in the quarter, but this was below the +36% reported by rival Booking.com Wednesday. Still, a solid quarter for the company which carried a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) into the report's release.Block shares blossomed +12% in late trading on its Q3 results after the closing bell Thursday. Earnings of 42 cents per share were well ahead of the 23 cents anticipated, on $4.52 billion in sales which took out the expected $4.48 billion. The company formerly known as ""Square"" reached 49 million monthly transactional units in Cash App. Shares are way down year-to-date, but late trading is helping buoy the FinTech staple, even as Gross Payment Volume was lower than expected in the quarter.PayPal is down -6% following its Q3 report yesterday afternoon, even as the company outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines for the quarter: earnings of $1.08 per share cleared the 95-cent estimate, while $6.85 billion moderately bettered the $6.82 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, not only was Total Payment Volume in the quarter, but so was Q4 revenue guidance. Shares are already -60% year to date.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

BAC, AT&amp;T Inc. T, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Biogen Inc. BIIB.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Bank of America, AT&amp;T and Lockheed MartinThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corp., AT&amp;T Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Bank of America shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past year (-23.7% vs. -22.7%), with the uncertain macroeconomic environment as the primary cloud on the horizon for the stock as well as the broader group.Bank of America's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and lagged in one of the trailing four quarters. Its third-quarter 2022 results were primarily aided by higher rates and loan growth. The opening of new financial centers, enhancement in digital capabilities and cost-saving efforts are expected to keep aiding the company's financials.Moreover, supported by continued loan growth, Bank of America's top line is expected to improve further. Given the rise in interest rates, the company is expected to keep witnessing growth in margins in the near term.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AT&amp;T shares have underperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (-25.7% vs. -14.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is struggling with a steady decline in its legacy telephony Internet and wireline services. High-speed Internet revenues are also contracting due to a decline in the legacy digital subscriber line.Story continuesWith the divesture of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T must build upon its core businesses to improve its value proposition as spectrum crisis and cord-cutting remain potent challenges. However, AT&amp;T reported solid third-quarter 2022 results with healthy wireless traction and customer additions.A customer-centric business model alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans is providing robust growth in its postpaid wireless business. The company is actively investing in key areas of 5G and fiber to augment its fiber footprint. While optimizing operations, it is aiming to increase efficiencies to lower operating costs.(You can read the full research report on AT&amp;T here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+43.1% vs. -8.1%). The company remains the largest U.S. defense contractor that has a steady inflow of orders from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.Steady contract flows and subsequent backlog growth bolster its long-term revenue prospects. The budgetary provisions tend to boost its business. Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products might hurt its component supply from Turkey.Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which, in turn, may hurt its results. Also, an uncertainty revolving around the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Progressive Corp. and Biogen Inc..Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

SYY, and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one for those interested in building up a cash pile.Johnson &amp; JohnsonHeadquartered in New Jersey, Johnson &amp; Johnson is an American multinational corporation that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.JNJ’s annual dividend yield comes in at a solid 2.7%, notably higher than its Zacks Medical sector average.Further, the company carries a sustainable 45% payout ratio paired with a 6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJohnson &amp; Johnson’s earnings streak is more than impressive; the company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in each quarter dating back to 2012.Just in its latest print, JNJ registered a 2.4% EPS beat paired with a 2.2% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSysco Corp. Sysco markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the food service or food-away-from-home industry.SYY’s 2.4% annual dividend yield is a few ticks below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average of 2.8%. Still, the company’s 8.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack by a fair margin.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s hard to ignore SYY’s growth profile; earnings are forecasted to climb more than 25% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 12.5% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 11.3% and 4.3% for FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSYY shares trade at a 19.4X forward earnings multiple, nicely beneath its 21.7X five-year median and a fraction of 2021 highs of 65.4X.The company sports a Style Score of an A for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAbbVieAbbVie, a global research-based biopharmaceutical company that delivers innovative medicines, became a top pharma company following its acquisition of Botox maker Allergan in a cash-and-stock deal for $63 billion in May 2020.ABBV’s annual dividend yield comes in at a steep 3.9%, paired with an impressive 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. The company pays out 41% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares trade at a 10.4X forward earnings multiple, above the 9.5X five-year median but representing a 53% discount relative to its Zacks Medical sector.The company carries a Value Style Score of a B.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTargeting dividend-paying stocks is an excellent strategy that investors can deploy.Dividends soften the blow from drawdowns in other positions, provide more than one way to reap a return from an investment, and allow maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.And all three stocks above – AbbVie ABBV, Sysco Corp.

125,fed84b65-06f7-3a2b-bbca-10e625184e54,JNJ,2022-11-05,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-johnson-johnson-130001211.html,1667566801,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +5.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has gained 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 points to a change of +2.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.27 indicates a change of +2.3% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $95.04 billion and $98.03 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lower-than-anticipated revenues and operating income in the Americas and EMEA segments, and lesser-than-expected sales in the Asia Pacific segment weighed on the results. The bottom line decreased 44.4% from the year-ago figure of 72 cents.The company generated net revenues of $5,311 million, rising 7.6% on a year-over-year basis, riding on pricing actions. The top line, nonetheless, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,573 million.In the reported quarter, tire volume was 46.7 million units, down 3% from the year-ago period. Replacement tire shipments declined 9%, reflecting a recovery in the number of imports into mature markets after supply chain disruptions affected the supply of those tires a year ago.  Original equipment unit volume increased 25.6% year over year on the back of share gains from recent fitment wins and recovery in industry volumes.The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company QuoteSegmental PerformanceIn the reported quarter, the Americas segment generated revenues of $3,304 million, around 11.4% higher than the prior-year period’s figure but missed the consensus metric of $3,370 million. The segment registered an operating income of $306 million, which increased 18.1%. Improvements in price/mix aided the upswing in operating margins. But the figure missed the consensus mark of $311 million.Revenues in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segment were $1,358 million, shrinking 2.8% from the year-ago period and missing the consensus mark of $1,541 million. The segment’s operating profit came in at $30 million in the quarter, contracting 63% on raw material cost increases and lower volumes. The figure also trailed the consensus mark of $65 million.Revenues in the Asia Pacific segment increased 13.9% year over year to $649 million but lagged the consensus mark of $662 million. The segment’s operating profit income was $37 million, up 15.6% from the year-ago figure, owing to the benefits of price mix. The figure also crossed the consensus metric of $22.84 million.Story continuesFinancial PositionSelling, general &amp; administrative expenses fell to $696 million from $727 million in the year-ago period.Goodyear had cash and cash equivalents of $1,243 million as of Sep 30, 2022, up from $1,088 million on Dec 31, 2021. As of the third quarter of 2022, long-term debt and finance leases amounted to $7,839 million, up from $6,648 million on Dec 31, 2021. Capital expenditure in the quarter was $254 million, down from $281 million in the year-ago quarter.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of 2022, the company anticipates continued volume growth in the Asia Pacific segment and volume softness in the EMEA unit. Raw material costs are expected to be up about $500 million in the fourth quarter. The company now expects to increase working capital within $300-$500 million, up from $300 million earlier.

IOVA incurred a loss of 63 cents per share in third-quarter 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 64 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported a loss of 55 cents.Without any marketed product and revenue-generating collaboration, the company did not record any revenues during the quarter.Following the earnings announcement, shares of Iovance were up 4.8% in after-market trading on Nov 3. The stock has declined 55.3% this year compared with the industry’s 22.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailResearch &amp; development expenses were $72.5 million, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter’s levels, primarily due to increased related personnel costs and facility building costs.General and administrative expenses increased 33.5% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $27.9 million due to an increase in related personnel costs and facility-related costs.The company had $366.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash as of Sep 30, 2022, compared with $430.9 million on Jun 30, 2022.It expects the cash level to be sufficient to fund the current and planned operations in 2024.Pipeline UpdatesIovance is developing its lead pipeline candidate, lifileucel, as a monotherapy for treating metastatic melanoma and metastatic cervical cancer in separate pivotal phase II studies — C-144-01 and C-145-04 — for metastatic melanoma and recurrent, metastatic or persistent cervical cancer, respectively, in previously-treated patients.Following discussions with the FDA, Iovance initiated a rolling biologics license application (BLA) submission for lifileucel in August 2022, which is expected to be completed by this year’s end. If the BLA is approved, lifileucel will be the first FDA-approved individualized, one-time cell therapy for melanoma patients. It will also be Iovance’s first-ever therapy to receive FDA approval. The BLA filing will be supported by data from the pivotal Cohort 4 of the C-144-01 study, wherein patients treated with the therapy achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 29%.Story continuesIovance has also been engaged in discussions with the FDA for lifileucel in cervical cancer. Based on these discussions, IOVA plans to reopen enrolment in Cohort 2 of the C-145-04 study. The study will enroll patients who have previously received anti-PD-1 therapy. IOVA expects this study to support a potential BLA filing for lifileucel in cervical cancer indication.Iovance intends to start a separate phase III study to evaluate the combination regimen of lifileucel and Merck’s MRK Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in frontline metastatic melanoma by 2022-end. The combination of lifileucel and Merck’s Keytruda, which has already been evaluated in Cohort 1A of the multi-cohort phase II study (IOV-COM-202), demonstrated an overall response rate of 67% in the given indication. This late-stage study will also serve as a confirmatory study for the pivotal Cohort 4 of the C-144-01 study.Iovance is also evaluating another TIL therapy, LN-145, as monotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in two separate studies.The company is also evaluating LN-145 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda or Bristol Myers’ BMY Opdivo/Yervoy in different cohorts of the IOV-COM-202 study. The study is evaluating LN-145 plus Merck’s Keytruda or Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo/Yervoy in separate cohorts in NSCLC patients.Opdivo and Yervoy are two blockbuster immunotherapies marketed by Bristol Myers.This October, Iovance started dosing participants in the phase I/II IOV-GM1-201 study to evaluate its new TIL candidate, IOV-4001, in patients with previously treated advanced melanoma and metastatic NSCLC in two separate cohorts.IOV-4001 leverages the TALEN technology licensed from Cellectis S.A. CLLS to genetically knock out PD-1 in TIL cells. This license is part of a collaboration finalized between Iovance and Cellectis in 2020. Per the agreement terms, IOVA has an exclusive worldwide license to use Cellectis’ proprietary TALEN technology to develop gene-editing TIL therapies targeting cancer.

It did not record any revenue in the year-ago quarter.In the year so far, shares of Karuna have surged 69.8% against the industry’s fall of 22.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailFor the reported quarter, research and development expenses were $62.0 million, up 59.8% from the year-ago figure, due to increased costs for developing Karuna Therapeutics’ clinical programs plus higher employee-related expenses.General and administrative expenses also surged 54.3% year over year to $19.1 million due to higher employee-related costs.As of Sep 30, 2022, Karuna Therapeutics had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.2 billion compared with $407.4 million on Jun 30, 2022.

KarXT is being evaluated in multiple late-stage studies as a potential treatment of psychosis in adults with schizophrenia.Earlier this August, Karuna reported top-line data from the phase III EMERGENT-2 study, which showed that treatment with KarXT led to a meaningful reduction in schizophrenia symptom severity. Top-line data from the phase III EMERGENT-3 study is expected in first-quarter 2023.Based on data from the EMERGENT program, Karuna expects to file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA for KarXT as a treatment for schizophrenia in mid-2023.Story continuesThe company also intends to start the phase IIIb PENNANT study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia living in the United States. Data from the study will provide insight into the long-term use of KarXT over multiple years.Apart from schizophrenia, Karuna Therapeutics is developing KarXT as a potential treatment for dementia-related psychosis (DRP). KRTX initially focuses on developing KarXT to treat psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most prevalent subtypes of DRP. During the third quarter, Karuna Therapeutics initiated the phase III ADEPT clinical program, which will evaluate the candidate for psychosis in elderly patients with AD. This program will consist of three late-stage studies, out of which one has already been initiated in third-quarter 2022 while the remaining are expected to start next year.

The company’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of higher prices and demand for phosphate and potash. Shares of Mosaic have gained 25.8% in the past year compared with 25.4% rise of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What do the Estimates Indicate?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mosaic’s third-quarter consolidated sales is currently pegged at $6,010 million, calling for an increase of 75.8% from the year-ago quarter’s tally.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the Phosphates segment is currently pegged at $1,630 million, suggesting an increase of 27.2% year over year.Moreover, the consensus mark for net sales in the Potash segment is currently pegged at $1,393 million, indicating an increase of 136.5% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment is currently pegged at $3,132 million, which calls for an increase of 78.5% year over year.Factors at PlayMosaic is likely to have benefited from higher demand for phosphate and potash in the September quarter. Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Global phosphate markets remain robust on solid demand and low producer and channel inventories.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong demand, low inventories and supply disruptions have also fueled rapid price increases for fertilizers in the United States and globally.Mosaic is also likely to have benefited from actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to have boosted its profitability. Transformational savings are also likely to have supported margins in the quarter to be reported.However, it is likely to have faced headwinds due to an uptick in key raw material prices. Prices of sulfur and ammonia remain elevated, made worse by the uncertainties over the supply from Russia amid the war.  Plant shutdowns and maintenance have also led to a tight supply of raw materials, which, coupled with strong demand, has ramped up their prices. As such, the company is expected to have faced margin pressure associated higher input costs.Story continuesThe Mosaic Company Price and EPS Surprise The Mosaic Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Mosaic Company price-eps-surprise | The Mosaic Company Quote Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mosaic this season.

The bottom line declined 76.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.45.The adjustments exclude certain expenses and benefits related to goodwill impairment (of $3.91 billion) related to the GRAIL segment, legal contingencies, and incremental non-GAAP tax, among others.Including one-time items, the company’s GAAP loss per share was $24.26 against the year-ago quarter’s EPS of $2.08.RevenuesIn the quarter under review, Illumina’s revenues were $1.12 billion, up 0.6% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%.Segment DetailsPost the acquisition of GRAIL on Aug 18, 2021, Illumina has two reportable segments — Core Illumina and GRAIL.Core Illumina revenues rose 0.4% year over year (up 3% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $1.11 billion. Core Illumina Sequencing Consumable revenues totaled $725 million in the reported quarter, unchanged year over year.Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Illumina, Inc. QuoteSequencing Instrument revenues for core Illumina were $162 million, reflecting a 10% decline from the year-ago figure. The decline was due to lower NovaSeq shipments on expected customer lab expansion delays and capital management as well as purchasing DLAs in advance of next year's availability of NovaSeq X. This was partially offset by record NextSeq 1K, 2K shipments on strong adoption by new Illumina customers.Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenues were $123 million, up 12% year over year on higher instrument service contract revenues on a growing installed base and an increase in core licensing revenues.GRAIL contributed $10 million to revenues during the reported quarter.MarginsThe adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 68.4% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 269 basis points (bps) year over year.Story continuesResearch and development expenses plunged 25.5% year over year to $325 million, whereas selling, general &amp; administrative expenses were reduced 83.4% to $146 million. These pulled down adjusted operating costs by 64.2% to $471 million.Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $292 million against the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $527 million.Financial UpdateIllumina exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments of $1.04 billion compared with $1.33 billion at the end of second-quarter 2022.The company did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of the quarter was $52 million compared with $272 million a year ago.2022 GuidanceFor 2022, Illumina now expects its consolidated revenue growth in the range of flat to up 1% year over year (down from the prior projection of growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.70 billion.The company also lowered its adjusted EPS guidance for 2022 to the range of $2.35 to $2.50(compared with the previous guidance of $2.75-$2.90). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.77.Core Illumina revenue growth is now expected to be approximately flat from fiscal year 2021. GRAIL revenues are now expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million.Our TakeIllumina delivered better-than-expected Q3 earnings and revenues. However, year-over-year performance remained sluggish. Within Core Illumina, NovaSeq consumables registered growth in the Americas on growing demand from genetic testing, oncology testing and cancer research customers. However, this was largely offset by customer lab expansion delays and inventory and capital management as well as a decline in COVID surveillance revenues. In EMEA, strong growth in mid-throughput instrument shipments was more than offset by the conclusion of the U.K. Biobank program and a decline in COVID surveillance revenues.A reduction in full-year adjusted EPS and sales guidance raises apprehension.One-third reduction of the 2022 guidance from the previous expectations is primarily due to delayed recruitment for some large research projects of Core Illumina in the Americas and Europe and the impact of inflation on research customers in Europe. Further, delays in instruments and consumables purchases, primarily due to the excitement around NovaSeq X, negative foreign exchange impact and consumables inventory deleveraging, are expected to impede growth in the rest of 2022.As a major setback, in the reported quarter, Illumina incurred a huge goodwill impairment charge related to the GRAIL segment, primarily due to the negative impact of current capital market conditions and higher discount rates, including a stand-alone risk premium on the fair value calculation of the GRAIL segment. This put immense pressure on the bottom line.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIllumina currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health Inc.

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.""7.

147,a70abcd1-5caf-31c8-8e98-787ce23f02ca,TEL,2022-11-05,Goldman Sachs: Buy these 3 stocks — including two with over 60% upside,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-buy-3-stocks-141458604.html,1667571298,STORY,"['GS', 'TEL', 'RELY', 'DT']","[Wow, it’s been a week in the stock market hasn’t it? Thursday marked the fourth session in a row of daily losses, with that particular hit coming after the Fed instituted its fourth consecutive 75-basis point rate hike. That hike, however, was expected; what really roiled the markets was Fed chair Powell’s indications that the central bank will not be cutting back, or even slowing down, on the rate hikes anytime soon. Inflation is currently running at 8.2% annualized, and the core CPI is up to 6.6% annually.These numbers are bad enough, but the today’s unemployment numbers show that the Fed still has a long way to go to get inflation down. The October jobs report showed strong hiring leading to 261,000 new jobs in the month, beating the expectations and throwing a monkey wrench into efforts to fight inflation – which will require higher unemployment. The Fed is raising rates to discourage the spending that fuels inflation; a higher unemployment rate will help in that, by reducing consumer outlays. Clearly, we’re not there yet.So how do you find the next hot stock to buy in this environment? One sound strategy, for the retail investor, may be to follow a major investment bank, and pick up the stocks tapped by the bank’s professional analysts.Goldman-Sachs is a staple of the Street, and its analysts have been busy, scouring the trading markets for stocks that are poised to weather the current uncertainties. We’ve pulled the details on three of the Goldman picks, using the TipRanks platform; on two of these stocks, Goldman’s analysts see over 60% upside potential. Let's take a closer look.Remitly Global (RELY)We'll start with Remitly, a financial services company operating in the international transfer payments niche. The company offers customers a secure platform to both send and receive cash transfer payments across international borders. Users access the service through a mobile app, and benefit from lower fees than are offered by banks. Remitly’s niche is popular with immigrant communities around the world, and the company operates in 170 countries.Story continuesThis company has been on the public markets for slightly over one year – it held its IPO in September of last year. Since the IPO, Remitly has seen its share price fall by 79%; during 2022 alone, the stock is down 51%.Remitly’s share losses have come even as the firm has been successful in expanding business and growing revenues. Remitly saw a top line of $169.3 million in the recently reported 3Q22, for a year-over-year increase of 40%. The revenue gain was supported by a 49% y/y increase in active customers, from 2.6 million to 3.8 million, and a 44% y/y jump in send volume, to a total of $7.5 billion for the quarter. Remitly is guiding toward 2022 y/y revenue growth of 38% to 40%, and is on track to achieve that.At the same time, however, the company’s quarterly net loss remains high. The Q3 loss was reported as $33.1 million, compare to $12.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Covering Remitly for Goldman Sachs, analyst Will Nance takes note of the risks – and goes on to explain why this company is likely to beat them.“Taking a step back, the bear thesis on RELY since they went public has been a generalized remittance bear thesis around competition, price compression, and poor unit economics; against that backdrop, RELY has maintained 50% customer growth, expanded transaction margins, and reduced CAC by 20%,"" Nance explained.""While in past quarters, the market has been unwilling to reward RELY’s outperformance on these generalized concerns, we believe the market should begin to reward the company for their solid execution and the secular cash-to-digital tailwinds behind their business as the company maintains healthy growth rates and scales into profitability in the coming quarters,” the Goldman analyst added.Quantifying his prediction, Nance gives RELY stock a Buy rating with a $16 price target to suggest ~65% upside in the coming year. (To watch Nance’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 4 recent analyst reviews on record for Remitly, and they’re all positive – giving the stock its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares are selling for $9.71 and the $14 average price target implies a 12-month gain of 44%. (See RELY stock analysis on TipRanks)TE Connectivity, Ltd. (TEL)Now we’ll turn from financial services to tech, where TE Connectivity works on the hardware side. The company designs and manufactures sensors and connectors for a variety of industries, including data communications, 5G networking, aerospace defense, automotive, industrial equipment and tools, consumer electronics, and smart homes. TE boasts of a major footprint in the tech world, with $675 million cumulatively invested in R&amp;D work, over 247 billion individual products manufactured annually, and more than $16.3 billion in total sales for fiscal year 2022. This is a company that has clearly found profit in the digital world.Early this month, TE announced its financial results from fourth quarter of its 2022 fiscal year, which ended on September 30. The company reported a 14% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues, to $4.4 billion, and an 11% increase in the GAAP diluted EPS, to $2.21 per share. In addition, TE showed company-record cash flows, with $944 million in cash from operating activities, and $745 million in free cash flow.Looking at the full fiscal year of 2022, the total sales revenue of $16.3 billion was up 9% y/y, and the fiscal year’s adjusted EPS of $7.33 was up 13%. Annualized cash from operations was $2.5 billion, with $1.8 billion in free cash flow. TE returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the fiscal year.The capital return was accomplished through a combination of share repurchases and a modest dividend. In June of this year, the company’s Board approved increasing the repurchase authorization by $1.5 billion, and the fiscal Q1 dividend has been declared for 56 cents per common share, payable in March of next year. At the declared payment, the dividend annualizes to $2.24 per common share and give a yield of 2%, matching the average yield found among S&amp;P-listed firms.This tech company has attracted the attention of Goldman Sachs' 5-star analyst Mark Delaney, who lays out just why he thinks TE will do well going forward: “We continue to see TE as well positioned for long-term growth given both its exposure to key secular growth markets (including EVs and charging/renewables), rising content per device (including about 2X the content on an EV vs. ICE vehicle), and its exposure to markets that are either relatively stable and/or cyclically below normalized levels (e.g. auto, A&amp;D, and medical that in total are about half of its total revenue). Finally, TE’s FCF generation remains strong, allowing the company to return cash and augment growth via tuck-in M&amp;A.”To this end, Delaney rates TEL shares a Buy, and sets a price target of $160 to indicate his confidence in an upside of 38% going into next year. (To watch Delaney’s track record, click here)Wall Street’s analysts like to follow tech firms, and TE has 10 recent reviews on file. These include 6 Buy ratings and 4 Holds (i.e. Neutral), for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $115.46 and the $134.50 average price target suggests ~16% one-year upside potential. (See TA stock analysis on TipRanks)Dynatrace, Inc. (DT)The last 'Goldman Pick' we'll look at is another tech firm. Dyantrace offers an AI-powered, cloud-based platform giving customers an intelligent automation system for network management and cloud monitoring. Dynatrace’s platform is billed as ‘cloud done right,’ and customers can use it for a wide range of applications, including business analytics, digital security, app automation, microservices, and infrastructure monitoring. It’s big business, as shown by some basic numbers: Dynatrace has over 3,300 enterprise customers, and sees a total addressable market exceeding $50 billion.Dynatrace is well into its fiscal year 2023, and reported Q2 results, for the quarter ending on September 30, this past November 2. The company’s financial results beat the forecasts at both the top and bottom lines, with total revenue growing 30% year-over-year to reach $279 million and the non-GAAP EPS coming in at 22 cents, up 22% from the year-ago period. The company’s subscription revenue was up 29% y/y, to $261 million, and the annual recurring revenue, an indicator of future business, was up 33% to $1.065 billion. Dynatrace has seen its revenue grow sequentially for the past 8 quarters.In a metric of particular interest, Dynatrace reported over $25 million in free cash flow for the fiscal Q2. This was nearly double the $13.63 million reported in fiscal 2Q22. The company is guiding toward $308 million to $321 million in free cash flow for the full fiscal year. Dynatrace reported having more than $563 million in total cash and liquid assets as of September 30.Kash Rangan, one of Goldman Sachs' tech experts, covers Dynatrace, and believes it’s a sound addition to a defensive portfolio.“We believe Dynatrace remains attractive in light of the current macro backdrop. A recurring subscription revenue model, coupled with a strong margin profile both on profitability and FCF makes for a defensive software company. The de-risked FY23 guidance and re-set in expectations around their growth algorithm makes the stock well positioned to navigate the current downturn,” Rangan opined.Following from this, the analyst puts a Buy rating on DT shares, with a $54 price target implying a robust 68% upside on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Rangan’s track record, click here)No fewer than 18 of Wall Street’s analysts have sounded off on Dynatrace and their reviews break to 14 Buys and 4 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $32.30 and the $44.31 average price target suggests it has room for 37% growth by the end of next year.

Irving later issued a more fulsome apology late on Thursday for promoting a project he said contained ""false anti-Semitic statements.""But the apology was not enough to stop Nike from suspending ties with Irving.""At Nike, we believe there is no place for hate speech and we condemn any form of antisemitism. To that end, we've made the decision to suspend our relationship with Kyrie Irving effective immediately and will no longer launch the Kyrie 8,"" Nike said in a statement.""We are deeply saddened and disappointed by the situation and its impact on everyone,"" the statement said.Several media outlets have reported the shoe deal to be worth $11 million, but Reuters could not confirm that.The Nets will also not pay him during his suspension. He is on a $36.9 million contract this season, after having earned nearly $195 million in his previous 11 seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics and the Nets, according to Basketball-Reference.com.The Nets had said he would be suspended no less than five games and until he undergoes a series of unspecified ""remedial measures.""Irving has faced heavy criticism since posting a link on Twitter last week to a 2018 commentary and defending the post over the weekend. The seven-time All Star has since deleted the Twitter post.Posting on Instagram Thursday, he apologized to those ""hurt from the hateful remarks made in the documentary,"" and said he took full responsibility for his decision to share the content with his followers.Irving said the film ""contained some false anti-Semitic statements, narratives, and language that were untrue and offensive to the Jewish Race/Religion.""Story continues""I want to clarify any confusion on where I stand fighting against anti-Semitism by apologizing for posting the documentary without context and a factual explanation outlining the specific beliefs in the documentary I agreed with and disagreed with,"" Irving wrote.The controversy comes at a fraught moment for Jews in the United States. The FBI warned on Thursday there was a credible threat to synagogues in New Jersey, a state that lies just across the harbor from the New York City borough of Brooklyn, which has one of the densest populations of Jews in the world.Irving's suspension and apology follow a controversy generated by Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who was suspended by social media platforms last month for posts that online users condemned as anti-Semitic.Irving's social media posts are not the first time that he has courted controversy in the NBA.He played in just 29 of the Nets' 82 regular season games for the 2021-22 season after refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine despite a mandate by the city of New York.(Reporting by Daniel Trotta in Carlsbad, Calif.; Editing by Michael Perry)]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 points to a change of -20.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 indicates a change of +26.1% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $48.97 billion and $52.84 billion estimates indicate +4.8% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Zions Bancorporation National Association investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 17th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.41 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.64 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Zions Bancorporation National Association stock has a trailing yield of around 3.3% on the current share price of $49.76. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Zions Bancorporation National Association's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Zions Bancorporation National Association paying out a modest 29% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Zions Bancorporation National Association's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 22% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Zions Bancorporation National Association has delivered an average of 45% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpIs Zions Bancorporation National Association an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. In summary, Zions Bancorporation National Association appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.So while Zions Bancorporation National Association looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

The cut was not because Wells Fargo couldn't support the dividend, but more because the Federal Reserve put certain restrictions in place during the pandemic to ensure that banks were well capitalized. Since then, these restrictions have been removed, and Wells Fargo has raised its quarterly dividend back to $0.30 per share for a roughly 2.2% annual dividend yield.Continue reading]"

Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with more on this. And I guess, Anj, we've already been-- I guess, heard the warnings that hospitals are beginning to overfill, but what else could we potentially see now over the next couple of months?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, we're definitely potentially going to be seeing COVID still. That's still on the horizon and plays into that threat of the triple-demic, tridemic triple threat, whatever you want to call it. We know that Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, was talking about this in a radio interview recently, and stressing the fact that the country is not really at a good place when it comes to fighting the virus. We're still at more than 400 deaths per day. We're in still in the thousands and tens of thousands of cases per day. And that is still leading the world. So not a good place at all.And with winter variants or a new variant on the horizon, that is potentially going to fare worse. We know that we've been following the BQ1, BQ11 variants, and they now, combined, make up 35%. And that's an increase from the last time we discussed this. It was 27% before. The CDC now saying it accounts for 35% of cases.But now, looking at RSV and flu, that is already stressing really the East Coast right now. The mid-Atlantic, New England, Washington area currently experiencing significant capacity strains, according to the CDC. And they're expecting that this will move through in waves hitting other parts of the US similar to the way that COVID did in the past years.Now, what's important about noting the RSV and flu early season, it's really an early and strong season for both, and flu specifically, the highest level of hospitalizations that they've seen at this point in time in the year in over a decade. So that's where some of the concern is coming from. Unclear whether or not it will be a quick rise and plateau, or if it will be a sustained surge of cases around the country. That's something that the CDC officials were unable to really pin down.Story continuesBut that's sort of where things stand. And we heard from specifically CDC's doctor, Jose Romero, saying that previous years, atypical seasons due to mitigation against COVID left a large swath of the US population uninfected. So children need to be infected essentially to get past it. Now, and the masking that was taking place before helped to keep all this at bay in the past few years.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Anjalee, I understand that Pfizer has released some new data on Omicron boosters. What can you tell us about that?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. As anticipated, we know that their updated booster-- bivalent booster has been effective and is supposed to be more effective, in fact, than the initial strain, which is why administration officials have stopped offering the original vaccine and are pushing the updated bivalent booster. New data out today saying that it was four times more effective for older individuals, which was really the target of this new shot. So after a month, they're seeing really good protection levels, as anticipated.SEANA SMITH: Certainly some encouraging news there. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much.]"

However, results for this age group were compared with pre-booster levels and not the original vaccine.Some experts caution that antibody readings do not translate directly into levels of protective immunity, and may not necessarily reflect how effective the booster shot is.""This data doesn't tell anything about whether or not this (four-fold) increase is clinically significant,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of vaccine education center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.Based on data from preclinical studies, Omicron-tailored shots made by Pfizer and rival Moderna Inc have already been approved in the United States for adults as well as for children as young as five years.According to government data, around 26.3 million Americans had received the updated shot as of Nov. 2, with around 3.4 million of those getting the shot over the past week.

Sports betting is one factor in Rupert Murdoch's proposal to recombine Fox with News Corp, according to people familiar with the deal's logic.Independent directors within both media companies are evaluating the proposal, which would be subject to approval by a majority of non-family shareholders.The Murdochs' early foray into sports betting has been slow-going. The sports betting app Fox Bet is available in four states, with just 0.2% share of the U.S. market, according to researcher Vixio. A free version called Fox Bet Super 6 has attracted some 6 million users whom Fox hopes to eventually convert to betters.The growth of Fox Bet has stagnated since Flutter acquired Stars Group, the company that helped launch Fox Bet and owns and operates the app.Fox claimed that Flutter failed to provide reasonable resources behind Fox Bet, a claim Flutter said the arbitrator rejected, finding that Flutter had agreed to commit ""commercially reasonable"" resources behind the offering.However, Fox retains the right to acquire up to 50% of the Stars Group's U.S. operations, which includes Fox Bet, though it would need to obtain necessary sports betting licenses.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Diane Craft)]"

175,0d19120b-9eac-3c4c-b579-5dbab37d3309,PYPL,2022-11-05,PayPal is 'the grand-daddy' of the digital banking space: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/paypal-grand-daddy-digital-banking-203002274.html,1667593802,VIDEO,['PYPL'],"[Lisa Ellis, Partner at MoffettNathanson, a division of SVB Securities, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss PayPal earnings, Block earnings, and the outlook for the digital banking space.Video Transcript- Some of the big movers in today's session are crypto and payment services. Coinbase, PayPal, and Block all moving after reporting earnings. We want to bring in Lisa Ellis, partner at Moffett Nathanson, a division of SVB Securities. Lisa, it's good to see you. You cover all three of these companies. So you're the perfect person to have on to ask about this. Let's start with the movement that we've seen in Block. We saw shares really take off today following the results that we got last night, closing up just over 10%. In a note out today, you wrote that after a wild ride over the past 2 and 1/2 years, Block's business is emerging from the pandemic stronger than ever. Why?LISA ELLIS: So in a couple of ways. The Cash App business, I'd say, is the real standout. That's their digital bank. They reported yesterday they're up to almost 50 million monthly active users in that product and about 18 million folks that use it like a primary bank account. Just for a point of reference, like a JPMorgan or a Citi have about 30 million mobile bankers. So this is like more than half of where they are. Those are all consumers.What happened during the pandemic, when banks were closed, right, and people were home, they downloaded and adopted something like Cash App as a form of digital banking. And Block's just done a fantastic job of building an ecosystem around that and really, really pulled in those consumers. That product literally was almost zero five years ago and is now contributing more than half of the gross profits of the company.- So Lisa, in that digital wallet wars survey that you guys have, what stood out to you in terms of the demographics and, really, the opportunities for growth there?LISA ELLIS: Yeah. It's true. What's interesting is that the digital banks skew younger in terms of cohorts, as you might imagine. But otherwise, there's no particular groups that stand out. They're not lower income. Sometimes, there's a perception that the digital bank users are more unbanked. They are actually not. They're very just mainstream. These are just simply individuals that are very mobile first and prefer to do all aspects of their life through mobile.Story continuesBut what Cash App and what Block are really doing there is they are trying to add services to move their way upmarket, adding investing services, adding lending products to migrate their way up to a more affluent consumer that has higher spending power, which is how they generate a lot of the revenue for those products.- Lisa, how are you looking at Block's crypto part of its business? Because revenue from Bitcoin this quarter, 1.76 billion. That was off about 3% from a year ago, slightly missing the Street's expectations. Is this a risk, do you think, for the company, given the activity, or lack really thereof, that we've seen in the crypto market as of late?LISA ELLIS: Well, I mean, it's not a risk in the sense that it runs through the income statement in kind of a funky way. So it shows up as a very big revenue line item and a very big cost item. But you really just net those out and it's only a couple percent contribution to the gross profit of the company. But it is a very big engagement driver and usage driver. Like a reason people download these apps and really engage with the apps daily will be if they're very active in crypto.And so when we're in a lull period like this, Block has to find other ways to engage consumers through other products, like, for example, they bought Afterpay, one of the big buy now, pay later players, who has very strong digital shopping services. And they're starting to integrate some of that sort of shopping and kind of deals and promotion type of services into the app too.- So Lisa, obviously then talking about PayPal, which is one of the first names in this space, clearly losing market share to some of this competition here. What is the growth story then for PayPal at this point? They've also tried to add on some services as well.LISA ELLIS: Yeah. PayPal is in-- it's true. They're in a challenging position in the sense that they're the granddaddy of this space. They've been so dominant for so long that it's hard for them to maintain that level of a leadership position when you've got Apple Pay and you've got the players like a Cash App or a buy now, pay later players kind of nipping away at their heels.So what PayPal has done-- I mean, a part of their offering I would highlight is that they bought a company called Braintree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Adyen. So more on the merchant side. So providing the merchants with a wide set of services. The digital wallets, of course, and the check out button, but also overall payment processing, things like loans for merchants.So they're sort of steering a lot of their business more toward the merchant side of the equation where they compete, like I said, with some of these big high growth players like an Adyen or a Stripe.- Lisa, let's move over to Coinbase because we're seeing the stock pop today. Closed in the green, well in the green. Yet the company reported a wider loss. Revenue was off 54%. Shares down nearly 80% this year. Yet you have an outperform rating on the stock. Why are you bullish on this name?LISA ELLIS: I love Coinbase. I mean, this is a long-term play. There's no question. And the reality is we're likely-- historically, crypto winters have typically lasted about two years. And we're only about six or nine months into this one. So we've probably got a ways to go if history is any indicator. So there may not be, arguably, that much urgency. But in terms-- I think of Coinbase as a very unique asset, as a large cap publicly listed player in crypto and way to play crypto.They're very differentiated in sort of the crypto infrastructure space. You're starting to see them doing these partnerships with a BlackRock or with a Google, where they're sort of the crypto inside, so to speak, where they're providing crypto onboarding capabilities, digital asset storage, the ability to convert fiat into crypto and creating that-- they're the plumbing or the rails in those applications.And it's that aspect of their business that I get really excited about. For example, in this quarter, yes, their kind of core transactional revenues are down significantly because just overall crypto trading activity is down, but their subscription and services businesses, which are all of these infrastructure type of services, were up over 40% quarter on quarter-- that's sequentially-- and are now almost 1/3 of the revenues of Coinbase. And that's the piece I'd really be keeping an eye on over the next couple of years as it becomes a larger part of this business.- Coinbase certainly growing with those partnerships, growing its ecosystem. A big thank you to Lisa Ellis. Great to see you. Have a wonderful weekend.]"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at International Business Machines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines What Is International Business Machines Worth?Good news, investors! International Business Machines is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $201.98, but it is currently trading at US$137 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. International Business Machines’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from International Business Machines?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for International Business Machines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IBM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IBM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about International Business Machines as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go see 5 Best Non-REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy. A well-proven way to fight inflation is to look for investments that have categorically outperformed during times of high inflation. Dividends have contributed nearly 40% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1930. When inflation averaged at 5% or more during the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, dividends contributed to 54% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500, as per Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy.Denise Chisholm, director of quantitative market strategy at Fidelity and an expert at historical market patterns, said:""Based on history, if high inflation is here to stay, I believe dividend growth stocks look likely to outperform."" According to Hartford Funds, the average dividend payout ratio over the last 95 years came in at 56.6%. As of December 31, 2021, the dividend payout ratio stood at only 31.6%, which leaves sufficient room for growth. As of September 30, 2022, 20% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index have dividend yields greater than the 10-Year US Treasury Note. Moreover, companies that boost dividends and initiate payouts to shareholders have historically provided higher total return as compared to firms that either maintained or slashed their dividends. Some of the best dividend stocks to consider include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Our Methodology Many dividend investors flock to REIT dividend stocks because they offer high yields. However, REITs are extremely vulnerable to economic cycles and have been hammered on the back of fears related to declining consumer spending, mortgage markets and housing. Therefore, our focus would be non-REIT dividend stocks in this article.We selected the following dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and dividend yields higher than 3% as of November 4. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.Story continuesBest Non-REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy12.

Here is what ClearBridge Investments Value Equity has to say about American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables. We have been active in encouraging these transitions and added a new position in American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP). AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”11. United Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) is an American provider of letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. On November 2, United Parcel Service, Inc.

Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 764,900 shares worth $140 million. Here is what ClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG Strategy has to say about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter: “UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”10. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of November 4: 3.46%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. October 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) declared a $0.50 per average diluted share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 19, to shareholders of record on November 11. Share repurchase authorization of $4 billion was also announced, and it is expected to be concluded by Q4 2022. Dividend per share will likely increase in Q4, and total shareholder distributions in 2022 will amount to approximately $26 billion.On October 28, Deutsche Bank analyst James Hubbard reiterated a Buy recommendation on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to 2,761 GBp from 2,779 GBp. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was part of 39 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 37 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of November 4: 4.82%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology company, operating through four business segments – Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing. On October 25, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.65 per share. The dividend is distributable on December 10, to shareholders of record on November 10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the highest yielding technology dividend stocks. On October 17, Stifel analyst David Grossman reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) but trimmed the price target on the stock to $140 from $150. IBM is defensive and likely affected less than most large-cap tech, but it is not immune to weak GDP growth and foreign exchange headwinds, said the analyst. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 funds reported owning stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of June 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $372.6 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 18.7 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a global pharmaceutical company focused on oncology, respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolism drugs. Despite incremental positive news flow, shares were hurt by the broader flight out of European stocks and the decline in the British Pound that started late in the quarter. We retain conviction in AstraZeneca given its best-in-class growth profile combined with its strong pipeline and commercial launch characteristics. We highlight breast cancer drugs Enhertu and Dato-DXd as two promising near-term opportunities.”7. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Dividend Yield as of November 4: 3.09%Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is a Texas-based company that designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers worldwide.

He was encouraged by the company's Q3 revenue and earnings upside and believes that its cautious Q4 guidance is ""prudent and generally as expected by much of the Street,"" the analyst told investors. He believes Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)’s product, customer, and end market exposure position it to ""weather the current cyclical correction better than most.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 55 hedge funds were long Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of June 2022, up from 46 funds in the previous quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.5 million shares worth $542 million. Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund has to say about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Within technology and communication services, we own a number of online businesses and semiconductor related companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments. Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions. This is because online businesses, as well as semiconductor companies, benefit from economies of scale. An online search and advertising engine will, in general, be more profitable per unit of cost as it grows larger in terms of users and advertising dollars. It is a hub-and-spoke model, in other words, where it is generally not necessary to grow expenses at the same rate that revenues grow beyond a certain threshold. Therefore, returns on capital tend to be higher, the larger and more dominant the online search company is.”6. AT&amp;T Inc.

If you want to see more of the most innovative companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Innovative Companies in the World.When most people think of innovation today, they think of computer technology or information technology.Many of the world's most valuable companies are computer technology or information technology companies. Companies like Apple and Microsoft are worth trillions of dollars. Companies like Apple and Microsoft also make some of today's most useful products such as smartphones or computer operating systems.Given their past history of making very useful and innovative products, it's likely that the leading computer technology or information technology companies will make very useful and innovative products in the future too.Improving SemiconductorsOne reason for why the computer technology sector has been so innovative is due to semiconductor chips becoming more efficient over time.Intel describes the trend otherwise known as Moore's law, ""From careful observation of an emerging trend, Moore extrapolated that computing would dramatically increase in power, and decrease in relative cost, at an exponential pace. The insight, known as Moore’s Law, became the golden rule for the electronics industry, and a springboard for innovation.""As a result of cheaper semiconductors, computers and smartphones became more affordable and more people were able to purchase them. With more computer and smartphone users, many information technology companies were able to gain more users for their internet services and apps. With the information technology companies having more resources, they were able to create innovative online services and apps that offered more utility. With more useful online services and apps, more people bought computers and smartphones. This cycle helped power innovation in the industry for decades.Although Moore's law has helped the computer industry innovate for multiple decades in the past, making faster and cheaper semiconductors at the rate described by Moore's law isn't possible due to physics currently.Story continuesAs a result, the computing industry has had to look for other ways of increasing computing speed including investing substantial capital into developing quantum computing. Although there is no guarantee that developing quantum computing will succeed, a breakthrough in terms of developing the technology could help fuel innovation for years to come.2022Due to high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times this year and the market has declined fairly substantially as a result.The tech sector has also been negatively affected by the interest rate increases given that the NASDAQ has declined almost 35% year to date. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to buy a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in 2021Dragon Images/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list, we took the top 50 companies from companiesmarketcap.com's Top publicly traded tech companies by revenue and picked 15 very innovative companies from that list that help make semiconductors or were leading information technology companies. We then ranked the 15 by revenue according to companiesmarketcap.com.Given that the level of innovation is subjective and there are many innovative companies both inside the tech sector and also in other sectors, our list is subjective.15 Most Innovative Companies in the World15. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes leading lithography systems needed to make the world's most advanced semiconductors. Given the company has spent multiple decades on R&amp;D for its state of the art lithography systems, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has a very wide moat. Some analysts think it could take multiple years for competitors to catch up. Given its importance, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has lately been affected by the U.S. China semiconductor tensions and its stock is down 45% year to date.14. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn't always worth more than its competitor Intel. In fact, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was worth only a fraction of Intel several years ago. Given that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are better for AI and machine learning in some ways than Intel's semiconductor chips are, however, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has surged as the market has priced in substantial future growth in the company's future.Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”13. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading semiconductor producer for smartphones. With the growth in demand for smartphones, demand for QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s semiconductors has increased substantially in the last ten years. Given its scale, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is investing substantial capital to remain on the cutting edge.12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the leaders in AI and also quantum computing. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) describes its quantum computing efforts, ""IBM Quantum leads the world in quantum computing. This nascent technology is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s most powerful classical supercomputers cannot solve and never will."" If it is successful in commercializing the technology, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and the world could realize substantial benefits.11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading semiconductor maker that operates at the very cutting edge in terms of producing the smallest and arguably most efficient semiconductors. With its foundry business model, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures semiconductors for other companies who design them. Given U.S. China tensions, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) could be affected by geopolitics.10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is no longer the leader in the semiconductor industry given its competitor's success in terms of manufacturing semiconductors. Nevertheless, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has substantial financial resources and the company is committed to try to regain the lead. Over the past few years, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has spent tens of billions in terms of R&amp;D, and the company plans to spend tens of billions more.9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Although Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s main product is electric cars, the company is arguably a computer technology company given that it has invested substantial capital to try to make autonomous driving possible. If it commercializes autonomous driving in the way the market expects, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) could have considerable more revenue growth in the future. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also working on developing robots that could do a variety of different things.8. TencentTencent is a very innovative tech company based in China given that it was arguably the first company to create the super app in WeChat, which offers many different useful services all in one app. After buying Twitter, Elon Musk is perhaps deciding to try and duplicate many of WeChat's features. Forbes writes, ""As a model, Musk has set at least some sights on the original so-called super app, WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent. In Musk’s first town hall meeting with Twitter employees last week, he directly mentioned WeChat, indicating that building something like it would further his broader goal of nearly quintupling Twitter’s user base to a billion people.""7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Although its metaverse investment isn't going very well currently, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is nevertheless a very innovative company given its substantial investments in AI. In terms of the future, there's also potential for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) if its metaverse product improves. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has already spent $15 billion on the metaverse and the company plans to invest tens of billions more.6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)As one of China's leading tech companies, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has substantial revenues and spends a substantial amount on research and development. According to macrotrends.net, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) spent $8.74 billion in R&amp;D for 2021, up from $6.09 billion in 2020. With the R&amp;D, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) could potentially create new innovative products and services. Given U.S. China tensions and delisting fears, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares have fallen 45% year to date.

186,618f49c5-6612-3787-84b1-826c9afdc6c6,MPC,2022-11-05,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004741.html,1667577604,STORY,['MPC'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Marathon Petroleum (MPC), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MPC that show why this refiner shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MPC, shares are up 1.97% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 1.43% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.59% compares favorably with the industry's 9.68% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Marathon Petroleum have risen 22.22%, and are up 85.94% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -10.14% and -18.83%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to MPC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. MPC is currently averaging 3,115,587 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with MPC.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPC's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.96 to $23.99 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Marathon Petroleum on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The upside can be attributed to improved air-travel demand. Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles or RPMs) for scheduled service climbed 15.7% in the quarter under review. Capacity (measured in available seat miles or ASMs) inched up 0.1% year over year. Load factor increased 1190 basis points to 88.5% in the reported quarter as traffic surge outweighed capacity expansion.Operating cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel and effects of Hurricane Ian, for the total system escalated to 7.81 cents from 6.18 cents a year ago.

They believed that the terms fell short of their expectations. Pilots will now commence a series of informational picketing events to convince UAL to resume talks to finalize an agreement.4. In a similar development, American Airlines’ AAL pilots reportedly voted down an offer by the company as they believe, the current offer does not match their expectations. Per the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing the pilots, its board voted down the offer 15-5. The turned-down proposal included pay raises of 19% in three steps over a two-year duration. The rejection highlights labor problems for U.S. airlines as they grapple with pilot shortage in the face of a strong rebound in air-travel demand. PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that even though most airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the losses were muted in nature.

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.62 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.81%. This compares to the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - Canadian industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 53.34%. Check Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is paying out a dividend of $1.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.91% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.66% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 20% over the past year. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.62 per share, Ryder (R) has a dividend yield of 3.08%. This is compared to the Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry's yield of 1.28% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 6.9%. Check Ryder (R) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ISRG)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-intuitive-surgical-120011901.html,1667649611.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Does the November share price for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.47bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.15%Est @ 7%Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$51bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$74b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$240, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.891. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

This earnings season has been a mess for the technology sector with numerous big-name companies coming up well short of expectations. Digital advertising has gone into a slump. On top of that, growth companies are cutting capital expenditure guidance, which implies further weakness in tech hardware demand heading into 2023.Understandably, some investors have given up on tech stocks. And there’s no getting around the fact that it’s going to be another volatile couple of quarters for the industry. On top of specific fundamental factors, the Federal Reserve continues with its aggressive interest rate hikes, which adds even more pressure on the sector.But the heavy selling has created huge opportunities. After years of tech stocks trading at massive valuations, great companies are now going for more reasonable prices. There are a ton of risks out there right now, to be sure. But for investors that can take a longer-term view, these seven tech stocks should come springing back once the tide starts to turn for growth-focused companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSymbolCompanyPriceMSFTMicrosoft$218.04TSMTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing$60.65ADIAnalog Devices$140.37SABRSabre Corp$4.67ZIZoomInfo Technologies$31.01BRBroadridge Financial Solutions$134.79TYLTyler Technologies$291.94Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comIt’s been an utterly dismal year for the so-called FAANG stocks and tech stocks in general. For the longest time, it seemed like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might be able to avoid the same slump that its peers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stumbled into. However, MSFT stock has now dropped to new 52-week lows following a weaker-than-expected Q1 fiscal 2023 earnings report.There were some glaring negatives in that earnings report. Windows revenues were down significantly as sales of laptops slumped after their 2021 boom. The company’s EPS growth came in at just 3%, which was among the lowest figures Microsoft has reported in years.Story continuesAdjusted for currency, however, earnings growth was 11%, which is a much healthier number. Meanwhile, while computer sales are down, Microsoft is continuing to post tremendous numbers in its cloud business. That is where Microsoft’s most promising high-margin growth opportunity lies. With MSFT stock down at the 52-week lows, shares are now going for just 23 times forward earnings.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in TaiwanSource: ToyW / ShutterstockIt’s been a brutal year for the semiconductor industry. 2021’s semiconductor shortage has turned into a glut as supply chains have normalized while at the same time, consumer demand for electronics has slumped. We’ve seen sales for semiconductor-intensive products such as laptops and automobiles dip considerably from last year’s record numbers.On top of that, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) faces a specific risk, namely that it is located in Taiwan. Tensions have ramped up considerably between China and Taiwan this year. Numerous geopolitical analysts have speculated that, although unlikely, China could invade Taiwan within the next few years. This would have an uncertain, but undoubtedly negative, impact on TSM stock.However, investors may have gotten too pessimistic with Taiwan Semi here at 52-week lows. For one, there are plenty of diplomatic means to hopefully avoid a worst-case outcome for Taiwan. For another, Taiwan Semiconductor has already started diversifying its manufacturing and is building large facilities in the United States. Long story short, the firm has the most advanced semiconductor fabrication technology out there, and it will be able to survive and adapt regardless of what happens with politics and economic cycles in the short term. Meanwhile, shares are going for just 10 times earnings.Analog Devices (ADI)Analog Devices (ADI) sign outside of buildingSource: jejim / Shutterstock.comAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a leading semiconductor company that, as the name would suggest, is focused on analog semiconductor chips. There is a business benefit to analog chips. They tend to be a slower-moving field than chips for consumer electronics such as smartphones. This allows a maker of analog products to earn money from a given R&amp;D investment over a much longer time span. Also, applications tend to be more niche, which limits competition and allows for stronger profit margins.Analog Devices creates chips that go into a variety of machines such as autos, communications equipment, simulation tools, power conversion, gyroscopes and many other fields. While some of these fields will be significantly impacted by an economic downturn, this diversification of use cases should give Analog Devices more sticking power than a company narrowly focused on just chips for smartphones or memory applications.ADI stock has more than tripled over the past decade, and it did so with remarkably low volatility as the company’s earnings and share price have steadily increased. This makes the company’s current 22% year-to-date decline one of the better entry points that we’ve seen in years for ADI stock. At this point, shares go for just 15 times forward earnings. Taken altogether, ADI stock makes for a solid pick among today’s beaten-down tech stocks.Sabre Corp (SABR)The logo for Sabre Corporation (SABR) is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSabre Corp (NASDAQ:SABR) is a software company that delivers ticketing solutions to the airline and travel industries. The quick breakdown is that there are three primary companies that offer ticketing solutions to airlines globally, with the exception of China which has a separate system. Sabre functions as a marketplace; airlines input their offerings and then customers such as travel agents and online booking websites can purchase via Sabre.Unfortunately for Sabre, it had taken on a lot of debt in the late 2010s to fund a massive overhaul and upgrade of the company’s technology systems. Just as Sabre was set to reap the rewards of this investment, the pandemic hit and left Sabre with a lot of debt and far fewer cash flows. SABR stock plunged from $22 to $4 as the pandemic set in. Shares rebounded to $15 in 2021 but are now back under $5.The reason for nervousness isn’t hard to see. Sabre hasn’t yet made it back to profitability and its debt load remains large. However, airline traffic figures are continuing to pick back up toward pre-2020 levels. And, at the end of the day, Sabre has a business with high-profit margins and limited competition. It’s just a matter of time until it can work through its current operational issues and get back on track.ZoomInfo Technologies (ZI)Illustrative Editorial of ZOOMINFO.COM website homepage. ZOOMINFO logo visible on display screen.Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.comZoomInfo (NASDAQ:ZI) is a communications company that helps customers with market intelligence and engagement. Specifically, it maintains a massive database of information about decision-makers and key personnel at large enterprises. Clients can access this database from ZoomInfo and use it to help enhance and target their sales and marketing efforts.ZoomInfo isn’t just the database, however. It has other value-added services on top of that, helping facilitate the sales process with customer engagement, messaging, and tracking tools throughout the sales process. As firms evolve their marketing techniques for the digital work-from-home age, this sort of information should gain more relevance as face-to-face sales take a back seat in many organizations.Unfortunately for ZoomInfo, it isn’t immune from economic stress. With technology budgets facing cutbacks, there is less money to go into marketing. This led to a massive earnings disappointment in Q3. That, in turn, sent ZI stock down 29% in a single day. That’s an overreaction. ZoomInfo is already profitable, and there should continue to be sizable long-term adoption of the company’s solutions, even if demand is currently reduced due to the economic cycle.Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)A photo of the Broadridge logo on a phone sitting on papers with stock charts on them.Source: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.comBroadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) is a technology company focused on financial services. It started as a spin-off from Automatic Data Processing (NYSE:ADP) and became an independent firm in the 2000s. ADP spun out Broadridge as a shareholder communications company, meaning it handled proxy statement deliveries, dividend reinvestment programs, and other such financial paperwork.Broadridge has modernized over the years. One avenue of that has been in making things digital; shareholders now can do their voting through brokerage apps instead of the mail. Annual reports, dividend statements, and so on have also moved online, increasing efficiency. On top of that, Broadridge has built or acquired various other technologies to handle back-office software for banks and brokerages, along with moving into paperwork management in healthcare and other adjacent industries.BR stock has slipped almost 25% so far in 2022. That makes this often expensive growth company into a much more reasonable value. It is now going for less than 20 times forward earnings. On top of that, it pays a more than 2% dividend yield and has increased its dividend every single year since ADP spun it off. Broadridge has a long runway to keep consolidating the software and services space for the financial industry, and as such should be a strong growth and income holding for many years to come.Tyler Technologies (TYL)Tyler Technologies (TYL) logo on the website homepage.Source: Casimiro PT/ Shutterstock.comTyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is another tech software rollup. Its domain is not in financial services, but rather in the government sector. Tyler built its business around software for courtrooms and legal systems, giving local governments the technology to manage caseloads, track court appearances, and so on.Over the years, Tyler has added onto this with other lines of software such as for managing K-12 school systems. None of this may seem especially glamorous, but it’s a great business. Local governments tend to be slow adopters of technology and stick with a product for many years or even decades once it is installed. This means that once Tyler wins a local contract, it should be able to generate revenues for at least 10-15 years if not longer from that deal.Tyler shares ran up to an utterly unreasonable valuation in 2021, topping 60x earnings and 20x revenues. It’s hard to make money, regardless of how attractive the business model is when paying those multiples for a company that grows revenues by around 15% annually. Now, however, TYL stock is down more than 40% over the past year. This has pushed it to 40x earnings and closer to 10x revenues. This still isn’t a screaming bargain, however, it’s a fair price for a high-quality software business that is sheltered from economic cycles since it primarily sells to governments rather than commercial clients. Definitely a unique play among tech stocks.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BR stock.

AFRM is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of 65 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 44.4%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by higher transactions, servicing income and merchant growth.Let’s see how things have improved prior to the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 82 cents suggests a 105% plunge from the prior-year loss of 40 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $360.7 million indicates a 33.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 12.4%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteHigher consumer spending in the September quarter is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spendings are likely to have increased in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The sales figures from the merchant and the virtual card networks are likely to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $115.6 million, indicating an increase from $92.2 million a year ago.The consensus mark for virtual card network revenues indicates a 59.2% year-over-year rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interest income in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at $144.5 million, indicating a jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $117.3 million.The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 103% year-over-year rise. These are likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal first-quarter results. However, rising operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are likely to have boosted the operating expenses, making an earnings beat uncertain.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of 82 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the September quarter: Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.68 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%. The quarterly results were driven by improved consumer spending, recovery in cross-border travel, higher gross dollar volume and increased switched transactions. However, the upside was partly offset by Mastercard’s rising operating expenses.Visa reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.93 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86. The quarterly results were aided by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. However, Visa’s elevated operating costs partly offset the upside.Western Union reported third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 42 cents, which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. WU’s earnings gained momentum from inflation in Argentina and reduced share count.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks analyst believes that solid demand for blood thinner drug, Eliquis and the label expansion of Opdivo should maintain momentum. Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and continues to experience growth in its market share.The label expansion of Opdivo into indications for lung cancer, renal cancer and gastric cancer boosted sales. The recent approval of drugs added a new stream of revenues. Our estimates for BMY’s top line suggest a CAGR of around 1.2% over the next three years, driven by solid demand for legacy drugs and the approval of new drugs.However, Revlimid, one of the top revenue generators, is facing sales decline year over year due to generic competition.(You can read the full research report on Bristol-Myers Squibb here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Verizon Communications have underperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (-28.5% vs. -15.8%).

Spectrum crunch with a saturated wireless market is a headwind.However, Verizon reported relatively healthy third-quarter 2022 results with the bottom line and the top line beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The company is facing supply chain disruptions, network fluidity challenges and weak Canadian grain crops are hurting the company’s volumes. Escalating fuel prices amid the Russia-Ukraine war pose a threat to Canadian National's bottom line. The company’s weak liquidity position is an added concern.However, Canadian National's efforts to reward its shareholders via dividends and buybacks are encouraging and highlight the company's financial strength. In January, the company announced a 19% dividend hike. Canadian National is also active on the share buyback front.Strong cash flow generating-ability supports Canadian National's shareholder-friendly activities.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Tapestry has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Figs has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TPR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.80, while FIGS has a forward P/E of 49.68. We also note that TPR has a PEG ratio of 0.62. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FIGS currently has a PEG ratio of 22.89.Another notable valuation metric for TPR is its P/B ratio of 3.31. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FIGS has a P/B of 3.92.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, TPR holds a Value grade of A, while FIGS has a Value grade of D.TPR sticks out from FIGS in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that TPR is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more of the most innovative companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Innovative Companies in the World.When most people think of innovation today, they think of computer technology or information technology.Many of the world's most valuable companies are computer technology or information technology companies. Companies like Apple and Microsoft are worth trillions of dollars. Companies like Apple and Microsoft also make some of today's most useful products such as smartphones or computer operating systems.Given their past history of making very useful and innovative products, it's likely that the leading computer technology or information technology companies will make very useful and innovative products in the future too.Improving SemiconductorsOne reason for why the computer technology sector has been so innovative is due to semiconductor chips becoming more efficient over time.Intel describes the trend otherwise known as Moore's law, ""From careful observation of an emerging trend, Moore extrapolated that computing would dramatically increase in power, and decrease in relative cost, at an exponential pace. The insight, known as Moore’s Law, became the golden rule for the electronics industry, and a springboard for innovation.""As a result of cheaper semiconductors, computers and smartphones became more affordable and more people were able to purchase them. With more computer and smartphone users, many information technology companies were able to gain more users for their internet services and apps. With the information technology companies having more resources, they were able to create innovative online services and apps that offered more utility. With more useful online services and apps, more people bought computers and smartphones. This cycle helped power innovation in the industry for decades.Although Moore's law has helped the computer industry innovate for multiple decades in the past, making faster and cheaper semiconductors at the rate described by Moore's law isn't possible due to physics currently.Story continuesAs a result, the computing industry has had to look for other ways of increasing computing speed including investing substantial capital into developing quantum computing. Although there is no guarantee that developing quantum computing will succeed, a breakthrough in terms of developing the technology could help fuel innovation for years to come.2022Due to high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times this year and the market has declined fairly substantially as a result.The tech sector has also been negatively affected by the interest rate increases given that the NASDAQ has declined almost 35% year to date. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to buy a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in 2021Dragon Images/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list, we took the top 50 companies from companiesmarketcap.com's Top publicly traded tech companies by revenue and picked 15 very innovative companies from that list that help make semiconductors or were leading information technology companies. We then ranked the 15 by revenue according to companiesmarketcap.com.Given that the level of innovation is subjective and there are many innovative companies both inside the tech sector and also in other sectors, our list is subjective.15 Most Innovative Companies in the World15. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes leading lithography systems needed to make the world's most advanced semiconductors. Given the company has spent multiple decades on R&amp;D for its state of the art lithography systems, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has a very wide moat. Some analysts think it could take multiple years for competitors to catch up. Given its importance, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has lately been affected by the U.S. China semiconductor tensions and its stock is down 45% year to date.14. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn't always worth more than its competitor Intel. In fact, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was worth only a fraction of Intel several years ago. Given that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are better for AI and machine learning in some ways than Intel's semiconductor chips are, however, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has surged as the market has priced in substantial future growth in the company's future.Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”13. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading semiconductor producer for smartphones. With the growth in demand for smartphones, demand for QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s semiconductors has increased substantially in the last ten years. Given its scale, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is investing substantial capital to remain on the cutting edge.12. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the leaders in AI and also quantum computing. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) describes its quantum computing efforts, ""IBM Quantum leads the world in quantum computing. This nascent technology is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s most powerful classical supercomputers cannot solve and never will."" If it is successful in commercializing the technology, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and the world could realize substantial benefits.11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading semiconductor maker that operates at the very cutting edge in terms of producing the smallest and arguably most efficient semiconductors. With its foundry business model, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures semiconductors for other companies who design them. Given U.S. China tensions, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) could be affected by geopolitics.10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is no longer the leader in the semiconductor industry given its competitor's success in terms of manufacturing semiconductors. Nevertheless, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has substantial financial resources and the company is committed to try to regain the lead. Over the past few years, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has spent tens of billions in terms of R&amp;D, and the company plans to spend tens of billions more.9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Although Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s main product is electric cars, the company is arguably a computer technology company given that it has invested substantial capital to try to make autonomous driving possible. If it commercializes autonomous driving in the way the market expects, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) could have considerable more revenue growth in the future. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also working on developing robots that could do a variety of different things.8. TencentTencent is a very innovative tech company based in China given that it was arguably the first company to create the super app in WeChat, which offers many different useful services all in one app. After buying Twitter, Elon Musk is perhaps deciding to try and duplicate many of WeChat's features. Forbes writes, ""As a model, Musk has set at least some sights on the original so-called super app, WeChat, which is owned by China-based Tencent. In Musk’s first town hall meeting with Twitter employees last week, he directly mentioned WeChat, indicating that building something like it would further his broader goal of nearly quintupling Twitter’s user base to a billion people.""7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Although its metaverse investment isn't going very well currently, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is nevertheless a very innovative company given its substantial investments in AI. In terms of the future, there's also potential for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) if its metaverse product improves. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has already spent $15 billion on the metaverse and the company plans to invest tens of billions more.6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)As one of China's leading tech companies, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has substantial revenues and spends a substantial amount on research and development. According to macrotrends.net, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) spent $8.74 billion in R&amp;D for 2021, up from $6.09 billion in 2020. With the R&amp;D, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) could potentially create new innovative products and services. Given U.S. China tensions and delisting fears, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares have fallen 45% year to date.

(NYSE:APD) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-8-5-past-air-110049509.html,1667646049,STORY,['APD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 84% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$4.8b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 8.5% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Air Products and Chemicals. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Air Products and Chemicals does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Air Products and Chemicals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Air Products and Chemicals. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.6% and 5.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$215m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Air Products and Chemicals. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

225,21f794fc-8b24-379e-95b4-91147b2ed131,FOX,2022-11-05,Fox says arbitrator affirms its option to acquire stake in FanDuel,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-says-arbitrator-affirms-option-215759451.html,1667599079,STORY,['FOXA'],"[(Reuters) - An arbitrator on Friday reaffirmed Fox Corp has 10 years to exercise its option to acquire a nearly one-fifth stake in FanDuel, settling a longstanding dispute with the betting app's owner, Flutter Entertainment Plc.The New York-based Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services tribunal ruled that Fox would pay $3.7 billion for its right to acquire an 18.6% stake of FanDuel, a sum that could rise to $4 billion when factoring in a 5% annual escalator.That's roughly twice the amount Fox sought to pay, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Reuters on Sunday.Fox received the FanDuel options in 2019 when the Irish gaming company acquired The Stars Group, a Canadian gaming company that licensed Fox's brand to launch a sports betting app in the United States.A dispute arose over the price Fox would pay for a stake in the market-leading FanDuel app, leading to arbitration that began in the spring of 2021.Fox sought to pay $2.1 billion to exercise its options in FanDuel, based on the price Flutter paid in December 2020 to acquire 37% of FanDuel Group from early investors, according to the documents.Flutter argued that Fox was not entitled to the 40% discount it received for accelerating the timetable for the buyout, and maintained Fox should pay the full market value for its stake in FanDuel as of July 2021 -- a valuation that one Wall Street analyst pegged at $35.1 billion.The arbitrator ruled Fox's options would be based on the fair market value of FanDuel in December 2020, or $20 billion, a decision Flutter heralded as a win.“Today’s ruling vindicates the confidence we had in our position on this matter and provides certaintyon what it would cost Fox to buy into this business, should they wish to do so,"" Flutter Chief Executive Peter Jackson said in a statement late Friday.Fox also issued a statement applauding the ruling, saying it gives the media company the option to acquire a ""meaningful equity stake in the market leading U.S. online sports betting operation.""Story continuesAs recently as August, Fox Chief Executive Lachlan Murdoch described sports betting as ""a huge opportunity"" for Fox Sports, telling Wall Street it would fuel viewer engagement. Sports betting is one factor in Rupert Murdoch's proposal to recombine Fox with News Corp, according to people familiar with the deal's logic.Independent directors within both media companies are evaluating the proposal, which would be subject to approval by a majority of non-family shareholders.The Murdochs' early foray into sports betting has been slow-going. The sports betting app Fox Bet is available in four states, with just 0.2% share of the U.S. market, according to researcher Vixio. A free version called Fox Bet Super 6 has attracted some 6 million users whom Fox hopes to eventually convert to betters.The growth of Fox Bet has stagnated since Flutter acquired Stars Group, the company that helped launch Fox Bet and owns and operates the app.Fox claimed that Flutter failed to provide reasonable resources behind Fox Bet, a claim Flutter said the arbitrator rejected, finding that Flutter had agreed to commit ""commercially reasonable"" resources behind the offering.However, Fox retains the right to acquire up to 50% of the Stars Group's U.S. operations, which includes Fox Bet, though it would need to obtain necessary sports betting licenses.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Diane Craft)]"

The streaming platform releasing its original biopic film, ""Weird Al Yankovic Story."" Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with more. And Allie, when you take a look at Roku's move here, I guess what does this signal just in terms of its content push?ALLIE CANAL: Well, this is certainly Roku's biggest original yet. It really adds to this push from the company to try its hand at original programming. You saw Daniel Radcliffe just there. He is in the title role. We also have other really strong A-list stars like Evan Rachel Wood, Rainn Wilson.And I will say, if you think back to some of the other streaming giants, like a Netflix or an Apple TV+, there was always that one show, that one movie that really solidified their spot in the streaming wars, had everyone sort of look at them a little differently. This could be the thing for Roku. I remember for me, for Netflix, it was ""House of Cards."" Apple TV+, I think you could argue ""Ted Lasso."" So if this film is a success, that could be something huge for Roku moving forward.Of course, Roku is free. So you can watch this for free, but it will have ads because Roku's business model really relies on ads. We saw that really impact earnings, as you were just mentioning this past quarter. But if Roku can be successful with this original content push, if they can keep people within the ecosystem and really monetize that, that's more a revenue opportunity for them moving forward. So this could potentially be a game changer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it could really be.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I will say, for that Weird Al movie, still hard for me to see Daniel Radcliffe as anybody else other than Harry Potter. But, you know, that's my issue.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: No, I agree.RACHELLE AKUFFO: [LAUGHS] Now I also want to talk about James Cameron's ""Avatar, The Way of the Water."" That's set to hit theaters December 16. Now 20th Century Studios releasing the official trailer. Take a listen.[VIDEO PLAYBACK]- So what does her heartbeat sound like?[HEART BEATING]- Mighty.[END PLAYBACK]ALLIE CANAL: Wow.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Now it does look gorgeous, but it is long. So Allie, do you expect ""Avatar, The Way of the Water"" to be a box office blowout?ALLIE CANAL: I really do. I mean, this film takes place 10 years from where the original film left off. And of course, it's been 13 years since we first saw the original movie. That's why theaters have been rereleasing it in theaters, and that's actually been very successful. It's added to box office gains. So even though this is a 13-year-old movie, people are still going to the theater. They want to refresh their memory so that they are fully prepared for when the sequel debuts on December 16.When I went to Disney's D-23 convention, they actually showed five very long clips of this, and I got to say, people were oohing and ahhing. Everyone was very excited in the crowd. The cinematography was amazing. James Cameron, he really wanted this film to debut in a theater. He wanted to wait until the technology was there. So I think there's a lot of hype around this film. And I certainly think it's going to be one of the biggest movies, probably the biggest movie of the year. And of course, it will follow Marvel's ""Wakanda Forever.""So just a lot to look forward to at the box office as we round out 2023. And it'll set us up for hopefully a successful 2024 because we are still below pre-pandemic levels. We'll see how ""The Way of Water"" can add to those.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, I will say, it's visually stunning. If there's ever a movie you're going to want to see on the big screen, it does seem to be this. Three hours, though? I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. We already saw with ""The Irishman"" and things like that, people having to, like, watch it in segments just so they could get through it. Three hours is a pretty long time now.ALLIE CANAL: It took me three days to watch ""The Irishman,"" so I totally-- I don't know if that speaks to my attention span or the quality of the film. I don't really know. But yes, it is a long movie. I do think our attention spans have shortened. We'll see. But I don't think that's going to stop people for this one. I don't know, Seana. I feel like people are ready for it.SEANA SMITH: I think people are ready. I think people who saw the first ""Avatar"" will be very excited to return to the theaters. I also think they have a massive selling point in, if you watch this at home, it simply is not the same experience. You need to watch it in theaters. I think it's going to be a massive, massive hit.ALLIE CANAL: I agree.SEANA SMITH: We'll see.]"

I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull.I spoke with Tim Nolan from McGuire. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said, it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year-to-date. But he did note, that over the long term, this company has a lot to look forward to.What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. Revenue expected to come in at $21.27 billion. Adjusted EPS of $0.51. Parks experiences and consumer products revenue at $7.59 billion.But a really important number is that operating income, $1.9 billion is the expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane Ian there. Perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney+ subscribers expected to come in at $9.35 million.Now, what Nolan told me to watch is that direct-to-consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, $9.5 million expected. Along with that add to your expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that ad revenues could surge up to $800 million in 2023 Thanks to Disney+. That's sort of the overall market opportunity there.Story continuesAnd then on the parks side, you want to make sure that gross bookings aren't going down. That there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases to prices, updates to the park, the Genie+ app, et cetera. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown.ESPN, I think, is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN another big question, right? Looking forward to the company, what's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapek will have to think about as well.BRIAN SOZZI: I think there's too-- just too much optimism around Disney+ coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a backdrop. Look we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well. Paramount+ now looking to potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good look in streaming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hasn't it going to go look in streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it.If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that ad slow down, there's not much you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there will cloud the outlook overall.But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney+. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service. ""Disenchanted,"" one of the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming.And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters and the next few years. And that's going to positively impact EBITDA. So a lot of macro concerns but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward.BRAD SMITH: And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side, too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like, how have the early days been for Netflix?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Netflix just launched their ad tier in the US yesterday. A $6.99 price point. Slightly below Disney+'s upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's gonna be a wait-and-see approach. We're not gonna have all the answers this quarter. I think it's gonna take a few quarters till we can really see that impact.I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases. Warner Brothers Discovery on the earnings call last night, they actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said, there's a lot of options with pricing, sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there.And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come.JULIE HYMAN: Looking forward to Disney.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Woo! Let's get it.JULIE HYMAN: Thanks so much, Allie. Appreciate it.]"

While there is a seasonal trend in utility usage, businesses and individuals will always have the need for gas and power.This makes the Utility-Electric Power Industry which is in the top 29% of over 250 Zacks Industries worthy of investors’ attention. Let’s take a look at two utility stocks to consider.Consolidated Edison (ED)ConEd ED is a diversified utility holding company that has been around since 1823. The company’s subsidiaries run businesses through Consolidated Edison Company of New York (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&amp;R), Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses Inc., and Con Edison Transmission Inc.The essential utility consumption by consumers is seen through ED’s CECONY business, a regulated utility that provides electricity to around 3.5 million customers and natural gas to 1.1 million customers.ED currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with annual EPS revisions starting to rise for this year and FY23. ConEd’s earnings are expected to pop 3% to $4.52 a share in 2022, based on Zacks Estimates. Fiscal 2023 calls for another 7% earnings growth. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to jump 7% this year and another 2% in FY23 to $14.98 billion.Year to date ED is up +5% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -23% and its peer group’s -4%. ED‘s total return including its dividend is a solid +22% over the last two years, outperforming the benchmark and its peer group’s -3% despite the impacts of Covid and the current high inflationary environmentZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConEd currently trades around $90 a share, roughly 12% below its 52-week highs. ED has a forward P/E of 19.6X. This is slightly above the industry average of 17.1X, but ED stock has outperformed its peers. Plus, it’s trading below its decade-long highs of 22.5X and near the median of 17.9X. Even better, ED offers investors a solid 3.56% dividend yield at $3.16 per share and recently beat earnings expectations this week by 11% at $1.63 per share. Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExelon (EXC) Exelon EXC is a utility holding company engaged in the generation, delivery, and marketing of energy businesses. EXC stock has been hit harder than most utility stocks after separating its power generation and competitive energy business, Constellation Energy Corp CEG.While EXC has seen higher volatility than other Utility stocks due to the split, it may be reaching oversold territory. Exelon will focus solely on transmission and distribution operations but still serves over 10 million customers through its regulated utilities.EXC is down -36% YTD with a large leg of the decline coming after completing the Constellation Energy separation in February. Despite the tough YTD performance, we can see from the nearby chart that EXC’s total return over the last two years is still near the benchmark and slightly above its peer group’s -10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccording to Zacks Estimates, EXC earnings are expected to decline -19% this year at $2.27 a share. However, Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to stabilize and rise 6% to $2.41 per share. Exelon’s sales are projected to decline -47% this year but rise 3% in FY23 to $19.65 billion. As Exelon makes the shift to focus on its transmission and distribution operations its top and bottom lines are taking a hit but may be presenting an opportunity for long-term investors.Exelon stock is 26% off its highs, trading around $37 per share. EXC has a forward P/E of 16.2X. This is below the industry average of 17.1X. Better still, EXC is trading at discount to its decade-highs of 22.1X and slighly above the median of 13.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEXC currently lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). Patient investors may be rewarded as the company starts adapting to its transition and EXC trades attractive relative to its past. EXC offers a generous 3.65% dividend yield at $1.35 per share and the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 22% upside from current levels.Bottom LineAs uncertainty remains in the market and the economy investors may want to consider less volatile stocks with businesses that can survive or thrive amid a challenging operating environment. Utility stocks generally tend to provide stability and utility costs are essential even during an economic downturn.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Programs like the CONSTRUCT Business Operations Academy play a critical role as we work to connect more residents to skills training needed to take on jobs in energy and infrastructure. Congratulations to the graduates for completing this program which will prepare them for meaningful, well-paying careers in our field and a chance to impact their communities for the future.""During the six-week program, participants learned the basics of business operations and project management, developed professional skills needed to succeed in an office environment, completed a capstone project with industry-specific case studies, and received job placement and support services from ComEd and its workforce agency partners. Participants who successfully completed the program received a $1,000 stipend and a Business Operations 101 certificate from St. Augustine College, as well as networking opportunities that can lead to key roles with local utility or construction companies.Story continues""Participating in the ComEd Business Operations Academy has given me the confidence I need as I take next steps to pursue a career in project management,"" said Jasmine Henderson-Dixon, a 2022 Business Operations Academy graduate and resident of Chicago’s Roseland community.

""Once again ComEd has creatively and boldly developed a new path forward, the Business Operations Academy, to introduce and train candidates for the backoffice and field work in the utility construction industry. We stand with ComEd in the goal to change lives and communities.""ComEd's investments in training and recruitment help create a local talent pipeline that is prepared to meet future demands, as clean energy jobs are on the rise. Last year alone, the U.S. energy sector added more than 300,000 new jobs, outpacing overall U.S. employment growth (USEER 2022). Growth of the energy sector is expected to skyrocket thanks to significant federal investments that will help catalyze clean energy infrastructure development via the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).ComEd offers a range of in-depth job training and apprenticeship style programs, including the CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy, Dawson Tech Overhead Electrical Line Workers training program – a partnership with the City Colleges of Chicago – and scholarship programs to support students in obtaining STEM degrees.

UAA came up with second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While revenues grew year over year, adjusted quarterly earnings declined from the year-ago period.The impact of supply-chain disruptions and higher promotions was visible in the sportswear maker’s quarterly results, as the gross margin contracted sharply.This Baltimore, MD-based player remains concerned about the tough retail backdrop and headwinds related to foreign currency. Soaring inflation is squeezing disposable income and dampening the demand for discretionary categories. Hence, Under Armour trimmed its fiscal revenue and earnings forecast.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has fallen 14.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 13.7%.Revenue &amp; Earnings PictureUnder Armour reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings of 20 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. However, the figure declined sharply from the adjusted earnings of 31 cents a share reported in the year-ago period due to margin contraction.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,573.9 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,556 million and increased 1.8% on a year-over-year basis. The metric grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis.While wholesale revenues increased 4.1% year over year to $948.2 million, direct-to-consumer revenues fell 4.4% to $577.1 million due to a 9% decline in owned and operated store revenues.

SG&amp;A expenses declined 1% to $594.4 million. Adjusted operating income of $129.4 million was significantly down from $188.8 million reported in the year-ago period.Other Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $853.7 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $673.4 million and total stockholders' equity of $1,816.3 million.

As of Sep 30, 26 million shares for $350 million had been bought back under a two-year $500-million program, approved in February 2022.FY23 OutlookUnder Armour now foresees low-single-digit growth in fiscal 2023 revenues compared with its prior projection of 5-7% growth due to a more challenging retail landscape and the negative impacts of changes on foreign currency. On a currency-neutral basis, management expects revenues to be up at a mid-single-digit-percentage rate compared with its previous expectation of 7-9% growth.Management continues to expect a gross margin contraction of 375 to 425 basis points compared to the baseline period's gross margin of 49.6%.

Discover how leading ESG companies are incorporating ESG factors into their corporate strategy, achieving meaningful impact and communicating with their stakeholders.For this edition, we are joined by Xylem. Xylem aims to create a world in which water issues are no longer a constraint to health, prosperity and sustainable development. With water at the core of Xylem's business, the company has a natural and deep commitment to sustainability. Hear from key Xylem team members on what it takes to be an ESG Trendsetter.How do you associate ESG with Xylem's corporate strategy and purpose?At Xylem, sustainability is at the center of what we do and, therefore, who we are. As the leading global water technology company, we help address one of the world's most critical environmental and social challenges, and that is the responsible stewardship of our shared water resources. It is important to note that when we talk about sustainability, we define sustainability broadly-beyond making a positive environmental impact. For us, it is about responsible practices that strengthen our company and that strengthen the environment, global economy and our societies. We, therefore, believe that in doing our work, we have the opportunity and actually the responsibility to create a safer and more equitable world. This alignment between sustainability and strategy enables us to create both economic and social value simultaneously. It also, frankly, nurtures a strongly purpose-driven culture. From a governance perspective, our board and its committees have been and continue to be incredibly valuable partners in our sustainability evolution. They regularly review and discuss our sustainability strategy and progress with us, and they provide unique inputs from each director's diverse vantage point. The other key, in terms of our engagement with the board, is that it helps drive accountability and that accountability is in service of our key stakeholders, including our investors.Story continuesWith the understanding that sustainability is core to Xylem, what are the benefits you've seen that others might be able to achieve if they tie ESG to purpose?We see value creation for all of our stakeholders when we drive ESG and our sustainability programs through our entire strategy, and for us, it starts with the customer. Inherently, in the water industry, our customers are concerned about providing safe, affordable drinking water and protecting the environment. By partnering with them and helping them achieve their sustainability goals, we also are achieving our business strategy. Internally, our employees, we have 16,000 employees around the world, that are passionate about water issues, and so, we're able to engage them not only in our sustainability initiatives but interfacing with customers, being advocates for the industry as a whole and also participating in our community impact programming and giving back. The final stakeholder group I'll highlight is the communities that we operate in and partner with, and we do that primarily through a program we call Watermark, which is our CSR program. Being able to have that mission brings all of our stakeholders together to create shared economic value, as well as social and environmental value.Have you seen a valuation impact on account of your ESG program?By nature of what we do, we have always been a part of portfolios that have been geared towards sustainability and impact funds. These holders take a very thoughtful and long-term approach to their investments, and so, as part of the research we did a few years ago, we recognized that there would potentially be a significant opportunity for us to increase our ESG Shareholder base over the coming years. One of the reasons for this is the generational wealth transfer of more than $30 trillion that will take place over the next several years, particularly from baby boomers to their children and grandchildren. Within that new generation of investors, more than 75% have indicated that sustainability will be critical to their investment process. That compares to about ⅓ of the baby boomer generation when asked that same question, and so, for us at Xylem and in investor relations, this meant a modest shift in our focus, messaging, and shareholder targeting efforts. The proof point is that we now have the highest ESG capital, including active and passive investors as a percent of our market cap, of all companies over $9 billion in market cap. We have the fifth-largest percentage of ESG capital as a percent of market capital of all companies regardless of size. We estimate about 30% of our shareholder base is now ESG holders, and that's roughly doubled in the last four years. It's been a meaningful change, and it's also one of the biggest reasons why it's been so critical for us, is that we're a company with the portfolio that's evolving and changing with technology, much like the market we serve, the water sector, is evolving and changing in a new digital age. Growth and disruption with technology do not happen in a straight line. We found this out firsthand after some challenges a couple of years ago and having to reset guidance and targets at that time, but importantly, these shareholders understood this. They supported us through these challenges, and they believe in the long-term strategy and vision of what we were building as a company for a sustainable water future.Xylem's 2020 Sustainability Report, Solving Water for a Resilient World, tracks their progress in tackling critical global challenges of water access, affordability and resilience. Working with partners worldwide, Xylem has advanced sustainability across their customer solutions, their business operations and their humanitarian work, with the aim of creating a more resilient and equitable world for all.Why did you decide to accelerate your ESG efforts, and how did you go about it?We view stakeholder engagement as a critical component of our overall ESG Strategy, and over the course of a year, we engage with a wide range of our constituents, including institutional investors, our retail shareholders, proxy advisory firms, ESG rating firms and industry thought leaders, like Nasdaq. At this point, we have a very well-established annual shareholder engagement program, and it typically involves our independent board chair, as well as our senior leadership team and a range of individuals from different functions in the organization, including investor relations, legal, executive compensation and sustainability. This past year, we invited more than 30 of our largest shareholders to participate in engagement meetings and for perspective, which represents more than 60% of our outstanding shares. These engagement meetings are an opportunity to discuss key aspects of our governance profile, for example, our board composition and diversity, compensation philosophy and, importantly, our performance around sustainability and social value creation. These meetings are also a great forum for management to get feedback directly from our investors regarding the practices and policies that are most important to them. Over the past few years, we've seen a very clear trend where ESG and sustainability topics in these meetings continue to be very central and to expand and evolve. It's absolutely critical that our team is current and well-versed in preparation for these discussions. Fortunately, we've been able to leverage the deep expertise that Nasdaq has, along with some of our other partners, to make sure that we understand key areas of investor interests, as well as some of the broader voting trends.What results did you get from your work with Nasdaq?We've always had a close relationship with Nasdaq, but our relationship has been even further enhanced over the last year by leveraging their expertise in ESG. The ESG space is one that is changing rapidly with requirements, frameworks, rating systems, requests from stakeholders and investors. Nasdaq has helped keep us informed and educated on these changes. What's relevant to us as an issuer, how to think creatively about targeting new long-term investors, how to prepare for meaningful engagement with investors and other stakeholders and providing thoughtful feedback and suggestions to key decisions and messaging around our ESG and sustainability strategy. They've been a crucial part and an extension of our team here at Xylem. We're fortunate to have that partnership.Nasdaq, Inc., Friday, November 4, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723950/ESG-Trendsetters-Xylem]"

It delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $337 million, 31.1% higher than the $257 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.The improvement in results was primarily due to higher commodity-based rates and higher Haynesville gathering volumes, including contributions from Trace Midstream acquired in April.Story continuesNortheast G&amp;P: The segment is engaged in natural gas gathering and processing, along with the NGL fractionation business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.The unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $464 million, up almost 5% from the prior-year quarter’s $442 million. This uptick was driven by higher service revenues from Ohio Valley Midstream.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $38 million, up 11.8% from the prior-year quarter’s $34 million.  The result of this segment benefited from stable commodity margins, which included the write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices.Costs, Capex &amp; Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, total costs and expenses of $2.2 billion rose by almost 3.8% compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.12 billion.Williams’ total capital investment was $950 million in the third quarter, up from $469 million a year ago.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Oracle’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle What's The Opportunity In Oracle?Good news, investors! Oracle is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $112.31, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Oracle’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Oracle look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Oracle's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since ORCL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ORCL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ORCL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you want to dive deeper into Oracle, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

If you want to read about some more slow growth stocks, go directly to 5 Best Slow Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The United States Department of Commerce recently released advanced estimates for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the country during the third quarter, revealing that the real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.6% between June and September. The number compares favorably to the 0.6% drop in the GDP during the second quarter of 2022 and the 1.6% decline registered between January and March. Prominent growth stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been buoyed by the new figures despite a recently announced interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The latest GDP figures reflect a rise in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Eric Winograd, the director of developed market economic research at AllianceBernstein, recently told news publication Financial Times that the GDP data should give the Fed confidence that what they are doing is going to have an effect. The numbers also give credence to claims from top experts that the US economy is strong enough to avoid a recession, soothing investor concerns around a market crash and boosting growth stocks that have been battered in an uncertain macro environment. Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe selected growth stocks that have strong chances to see their share price grow in the coming months and years. We call them ""slow"" growth stocks because their growth could be slow and face headwinds in the short term due to the current macroeconomic situation and recession fears. However, these stocks have long-term growth catalysts and positive ratings from market experts. These stocks are popular among the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.Story continuesBest Slow Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29  Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers. It is one of the best growth stocks to invest in. On September 24, Etsy advised their sellers to update their return policies by the end of October, noting there are certain types of listings where returns are not appropriate. On September 26, Etsy said it was giving coupons of 20% off to their customers to increase their sales and encourage customers to shop more.On October 10, BTIG analyst Marvin Fong maintained a Buy rating on Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock and lowered the price target to $119 from $122, noting that the company's Q3 gross merchandise volume guidance had upside and 6% sequential growth. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $595.9 million in Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), compared to 43 in the preceding quarter worth $668.5 million. Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) is one of the best growth stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We became interested in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) when Josh Silverman took over as CEO in 2017. The company had long been recognized as a great marketplace, but prior management was not focused on maximizing shareholder value. In short order, Silverman transformed Etsy from a borderline non-profit into a higher-margin, faster-growing enterprise. The pandemic helped accelerate already strong fundamental business results as millions of new customers were introduced to the platform while stuck at home. But like so many other Covid-19 “winners,” Etsy has since fallen deeply out of favor with investors, which prompted us to take a closer look. Following a 75% decline in its stock price, the company now trades for 3.5x next year’s revenue or just a low double-digit multiple of operating profit using our estimate of normalized margins. We believe this is an attractive price to pay for a unique digital marketplace with a long runway for future growth. Note that our exposure to Etsy is currently established via options.”9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. It is one of the top growth stocks to invest in. On October 14, Intel Corporation stated that it is planning to start the sales of its first six 13th Generation Core Raptor Lake processors in India for desktops with unlocked multipliers in the third week of October. It will include 23 models comprising Raptor Lake and Alder Lake silicon. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Hold rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock and lowered the price target to $32 from $35, noting that the advisory expects a decline in 2023 estimates for the firm. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 65 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 76 in the preceding quarter worth $3.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Then, there is the case of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V-based products worldwide. It is one of the premier growth stocks to invest in. On October 11, Broadcom added that it has partnered up with Artista, a computer network company, to announce the availability of the industry’s first open end-to-end networking solution optimized for Remote Direct Access over Coverage Ethernet.  On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Hold rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock and lowered the price target to $575 from $635, noting that there was negative risk to 2023 projections for the second straight quarter. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) with 1.4 million shares worth more than $716 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”7. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69      Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide. It is one of the elite growth stocks to invest in. On October 17, Oracle announced its collaboration with TechSee, a member of the Oracle Partner Network, to bring the next generation of visual and AI-powered service automation to Oracle Field Service to provide augmented reality guidance to agents and technicians’ mobile devices over an instant video stream.On October 21, KeyBanc analyst Michael Turits upgraded Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $80 price target, noting that the company laid out a plan to mid-40s margins and multiyear high single-digit revenue growth recently. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.2 billion in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared to 61 in the previous quarter worth $4.3 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result, plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better-than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”6.

Almost anyone who purchased these for the dividend payments over the last year is now at a loss with the position.Anticipating a drop in revenue and income has REIT analysts generally reducing price targets and downgrading names. Fund investors are looking at the effects of much higher rates on financing and at the slide in value of underlying properties. None of this adds up to higher prices for real estate investment trusts, so they’re sold.AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB) owns apartment complexes in New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. , California and the Pacific Northwest. The REIT pays a 3.72% dividend.The Nov. 3 action takes AvalonBay below all of the previous October 2022 lows, setting a new low for the year. Trading below the downtrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages is not a bullish look.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) buys, manages and develops multifamily apartment communities in places such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston and Atlanta. The company is paying a 3.26% dividend.The price gapped down to a new low for the year and remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, both of which are trending downward. There’s a positive divergence on the relative strength indicator (RSI) below the price chart.Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) owns 310 apartment complexes in Southern California, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C.The REIT pays a dividend of 4.04%.The price gapped down to $60 at the opening of trading on Nov. 3, then found buying interest and managed to close at $61.38. As with the other real estate investment trusts, Equity Residential trades in a downtrend, deeply below both significant moving averages.Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE: EXR) is based in Salt Lake City and owns and operates self-storage properties in 41 states. The REIT pays a 3.79% dividend.Story continuesIt’s a strongly negative start to November for the company with new 52-week lows clearly in place — and just when, by late October, Extra Space looked as if it might conquer the 50-day moving average. Note the very large red selling volume bars beneath the first two sessions of the month.Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) is the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the country with 2,800 units in 39 states. This REIT is paying a dividend of 2.83%.This is another one where the first two trading sessions in November completely reversed a mid- to late-October rally. The company this week hit a new 52-week low on heavy volume and now goes for less than its downtrending 50-day and 200-day moving averages.See more on real estate investing from Benzinga:This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?There's No Bear Market For This Real Estate Fund...

254,8e8346ba-7615-3ea1-a53a-30dcc1246530,MU,2022-11-05,Return Trends At Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) Aren't Appealing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-micron-technology-nasdaq-110053369.html,1667646053,STORY,['MU'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Micron Technology:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$9.7b ÷ (US$66b - US$7.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Micron Technology has an ROCE of 17%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 15% generated by the Semiconductor industry. Check out our latest analysis for Micron Technology roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Micron Technology compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Micron Technology here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 96% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 17%. Since 17% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.The Bottom Line On Micron Technology's ROCEIn the end, Micron Technology has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. In light of this, the stock has only gained 26% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Micron Technology  that we think you should be aware of.While Micron Technology may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have both recently outlined fears of a sharp slowdown in the economy as the central bank continues with an aggressive rate hike policy intended to curb inflation by raising borrowing costs. Solomon recently said that economic conditions would tighten meaningfully, noting that “until you get to that point where you see a change in labor or demand, you are going to see central banks continue to move on that trajectory”. Meanwhile, Dimon has also echoed these comments, noting that excess money was running out for American consumers. Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), and Prologis, Inc.

TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. (NYSE:TRTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13    TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. (NYSE:TRTX) a commercial real estate finance company that originates, acquires, and manages commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in the United States. It is one of the top strong buy stocks to invest in.

The company placed $907 million of investment-grade bonds with institutional investors. On October 18, Raymond James maintained a Strong Buy rating on TPG RE Finance Trust (NYSE:TRTX) stock with a price target of $11.5.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, California-based investment firm Brevan Howard is a leading shareholder in TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.

This program replaced the company's existing $100 million repurchase program and it has no time limits and may be modified, discontinued and suspended at any time. On October 18, Analyst Raymond James maintained a Strong Buy rating on Redwood Trust, Inc.

(NYSE:RWT), compared to 16 in the previous quarter worth $75 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We took advantage of the selloff in the financials sector to add a new position in Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT). The company operates as a speciality finance company within the residential mortgage banking and business purpose mortgage banking industries and capitalized as large investment banks shed their mortgage securitization businesses after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Redwood has since expanded to become the industry leader in the distribution of loans through whole loan sales.Additionally, its investment portfolio has been very strong historically, even in the GFC, and its expansion into banking has made it better. We believe that the company’s long-term value creation is substantially underrepresented in its current market price and look forward to it being a high-quality long-term compounder within the portfolio.”11. Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17     Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) provides commercial real estate services under the Cushman &amp; Wakefield brand. It is one of the premier strong buy stocks to invest in. On August 8, Cushman &amp; Wakefield revealed that it has acquired Burbage Realty Partners, a specialist in UK logistics and industrial.

Here is what the fund said:“U.S.-domiciled Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) is one of the largest companies in the commercial real estate brokerage industry, a sector that is consolidating as scale has differentiated large competitors from their smaller peers. This has enabled large industry participants, such as Cushman &amp; Wakefield, to gain significant market share in transactional business lines like leasing brokerage and capital markets while simultaneously building significant outsourcing businesses with contractual revenue streams. We expect the company to continue growing its market share over time as economies of scale also drive gradual improvement in profit margins. Despite this strong outlook, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is trading at a mid-single-digit multiple of current-year earnings—a material discount to the broad market and its large brokerage peers. We see this as an opportunity to own a high-quality, well-managed company at a bargain price.”10. Hancock Whitney Corporation (NYSE:HWC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22   Hancock Whitney Corporation (NYSE:HWC) operates as the financial holding company for Hancock Whitney Bank that provides traditional and online banking services to commercial, small business, and retail customers.

(NYSE:T) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“I purchased shares of AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) prior to its spin-off of Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD). Most people are probably familiar with AT&amp;T. They are a major cellular service provider, and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets, which include HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, DC Comics and the Batman content brands, and more. At the time of my purchase, I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield, or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD, which now has HBO Max, has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then, Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth, which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings.As a result, shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present, but we may add to it over time.”7. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25     PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) designs, manufactures and distributes light, medium, and heavy-duty commercial trucks internationally.

Here is what the fund said:“We added just one new position to the portfolio during the third quarter: PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR). We believe Paccar is a well-managed, high-quality global commercial vehicle manufacturer that trades at a low multiple of normalized earnings. Paccar has consistently grown its earnings power via market share gains, improved margins and above-average growth of its highly profitable parts and services business. Despite operating in a cyclical industry, the company has been profitable for 82 consecutive years while steadily generating higher peak and trough EPS through each successive cycle. We had the opportunity to purchase Paccar at what we believe is an attractive price due to transitory concerns related to Covid-19-induced supply chain pressures, elevated cyclical uncertainty and the longer-term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. We believe our long-time horizon provides a significant advantage as we can look through the short-term headwinds and focus more on what Paccar should earn on a mid-cycle basis. Furthermore, while we do expect increased commercial vehicle electrification over time, we believe the company is well positioned to integrate new propulsion systems to meet customer demands.”6.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.

Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.62 a share, just 18 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 22, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.62 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.24 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Dick's Sporting Goods has an Earnings ESP of 17.23%.DKS is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 26, 2023.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have both recently outlined fears of a sharp slowdown in the economy as the central bank continues with an aggressive rate hike policy intended to curb inflation by raising borrowing costs. Solomon recently said that economic conditions would tighten meaningfully, noting that “until you get to that point where you see a change in labor or demand, you are going to see central banks continue to move on that trajectory”. Meanwhile, Dimon has also echoed these comments, noting that excess money was running out for American consumers. Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), and Prologis, Inc.

(NYSE:RWT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We took advantage of the selloff in the financials sector to add a new position in Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT). The company operates as a speciality finance company within the residential mortgage banking and business purpose mortgage banking industries and capitalized as large investment banks shed their mortgage securitization businesses after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Redwood has since expanded to become the industry leader in the distribution of loans through whole loan sales.Additionally, its investment portfolio has been very strong historically, even in the GFC, and its expansion into banking has made it better. We believe that the company’s long-term value creation is substantially underrepresented in its current market price and look forward to it being a high-quality long-term compounder within the portfolio.”11. Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17     Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) provides commercial real estate services under the Cushman &amp; Wakefield brand.

Here is what the fund said:“U.S.-domiciled Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) is one of the largest companies in the commercial real estate brokerage industry, a sector that is consolidating as scale has differentiated large competitors from their smaller peers. This has enabled large industry participants, such as Cushman &amp; Wakefield, to gain significant market share in transactional business lines like leasing brokerage and capital markets while simultaneously building significant outsourcing businesses with contractual revenue streams. We expect the company to continue growing its market share over time as economies of scale also drive gradual improvement in profit margins. Despite this strong outlook, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is trading at a mid-single-digit multiple of current-year earnings—a material discount to the broad market and its large brokerage peers. We see this as an opportunity to own a high-quality, well-managed company at a bargain price.”10.

(NYSE:T) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“I purchased shares of AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) prior to its spin-off of Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD). Most people are probably familiar with AT&amp;T. They are a major cellular service provider, and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets, which include HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, DC Comics and the Batman content brands, and more. At the time of my purchase, I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield, or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD, which now has HBO Max, has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then, Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth, which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings.As a result, shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present, but we may add to it over time.”7. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25     PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) designs, manufactures and distributes light, medium, and heavy-duty commercial trucks internationally.

If you’re an income investor, your primary consideration is naturally to derive the best yield from your dividend stocks at the time of purchase, but it’s also knowing that company dividends will continue to grow over time to enhance your monthly or quarterly income.On the other hand, growth investors are not usually too concerned about dividends but are looking for a stock that can generate solid appreciation over time. Sometimes, investors can have both. Here’s a look at one popular real estate investment trust (REIT) over the past five years and what it’s generating in dividends today compared with November 2017:Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages industrial logistics properties across the U.S. and in 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, Prologis has been a leader in appreciation among REIT stocks. Although it pays an annual dividend of $3.16, it is more growth than income oriented. Its annual dividend yield is usually well below other REITs in its peer group.Between October 2017 and April 2022, Prologis stock ran up from $56 to $174, a gain of approximately 210%, Very few REITs will ever be able to match that type of performance.While Prologis’s appreciation performance has been stellar, it has never been known for generating a high dividend yield. But welcome to 2022, where the Federal Reserve has been on a mission to squash inflation with four consecutive three-quarters of a point interest rate hikes.Interest rate hikes slammed Prologis’s stock price from $174 to a low of $98 in mid-October. And although it has bounced back to nearly $109 since, Prologis now has a dividend yield of 2.91%, or some 22% higher than its five-year dividend yield average.During that incredible five-year run, Prologis raised its quarterly dividend several times, increasing it from $0.44 per share to $0.79. So take a look at how much $10,000 invested in Prologis five years ago would be generating in dividends today.Story continuesIf you had invested $10,000 in Prologis stock in November 2017, you would have received 150.29 shares at a starting price of $66.54. During those five years, you would have received $11.69 in dividends. With the appreciation, your total return would be 79.89%. The original investment of $10,000 would now be worth $17,986.If you had chosen to reinvest the dividends, as many growth-oriented investors do, your original 150.29 shares would now have grown to 170.48 shares, for a total return of 84.14%. Your starting investment of $10,000 would now be worth $18,413.In the most recent quarter, with a dividend of $0.79 per share, 150.29 shares would have generated $118.72 in cash.Obviously, with the pullback in price, Prologis is not quite the growth stock it once was but has enriched shareholders with a much better dividend yield than in past years.See more on real estate investing from Benzinga:This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?There's No Bear Market For This Real Estate Fund...

Redwood has since expanded to become the industry leader in the distribution of loans through whole loan sales.Additionally, its investment portfolio has been very strong historically, even in the GFC, and its expansion into banking has made it better. We believe that the company’s long-term value creation is substantially underrepresented in its current market price and look forward to it being a high-quality long-term compounder within the portfolio.”11.

This has enabled large industry participants, such as Cushman &amp; Wakefield, to gain significant market share in transactional business lines like leasing brokerage and capital markets while simultaneously building significant outsourcing businesses with contractual revenue streams. We expect the company to continue growing its market share over time as economies of scale also drive gradual improvement in profit margins. Despite this strong outlook, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is trading at a mid-single-digit multiple of current-year earnings—a material discount to the broad market and its large brokerage peers.

Most people are probably familiar with AT&amp;T. They are a major cellular service provider, and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets, which include HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, DC Comics and the Batman content brands, and more. At the time of my purchase, I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield, or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD, which now has HBO Max, has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then, Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth, which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings.As a result, shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present, but we may add to it over time.”7.

Here is what the fund said:“We added just one new position to the portfolio during the third quarter: PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR). We believe Paccar is a well-managed, high-quality global commercial vehicle manufacturer that trades at a low multiple of normalized earnings. Paccar has consistently grown its earnings power via market share gains, improved margins and above-average growth of its highly profitable parts and services business. Despite operating in a cyclical industry, the company has been profitable for 82 consecutive years while steadily generating higher peak and trough EPS through each successive cycle. We had the opportunity to purchase Paccar at what we believe is an attractive price due to transitory concerns related to Covid-19-induced supply chain pressures, elevated cyclical uncertainty and the longer-term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. We believe our long-time horizon provides a significant advantage as we can look through the short-term headwinds and focus more on what Paccar should earn on a mid-cycle basis. Furthermore, while we do expect increased commercial vehicle electrification over time, we believe the company is well positioned to integrate new propulsion systems to meet customer demands.”6.

We believe our long-time horizon provides a significant advantage as we can look through the short-term headwinds and focus more on what Paccar should earn on a mid-cycle basis. Furthermore, while we do expect increased commercial vehicle electrification over time, we believe the company is well positioned to integrate new propulsion systems to meet customer demands.”6.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go see 5 Best Non-REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy. A well-proven way to fight inflation is to look for investments that have categorically outperformed during times of high inflation. Dividends have contributed nearly 40% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1930. When inflation averaged at 5% or more during the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, dividends contributed to 54% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500, as per Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy.Denise Chisholm, director of quantitative market strategy at Fidelity and an expert at historical market patterns, said:""Based on history, if high inflation is here to stay, I believe dividend growth stocks look likely to outperform."" According to Hartford Funds, the average dividend payout ratio over the last 95 years came in at 56.6%. As of December 31, 2021, the dividend payout ratio stood at only 31.6%, which leaves sufficient room for growth. As of September 30, 2022, 20% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index have dividend yields greater than the 10-Year US Treasury Note. Moreover, companies that boost dividends and initiate payouts to shareholders have historically provided higher total return as compared to firms that either maintained or slashed their dividends. Some of the best dividend stocks to consider include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Our Methodology Many dividend investors flock to REIT dividend stocks because they offer high yields. However, REITs are extremely vulnerable to economic cycles and have been hammered on the back of fears related to declining consumer spending, mortgage markets and housing. Therefore, our focus would be non-REIT dividend stocks in this article.We selected the following dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and dividend yields higher than 3% as of November 4.

(NASDAQ:AEP) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“About 5% of the portfolio is in transitioning power companies, typically migrating from coal to renewables.

AEP has the fastest planned renewable energy ramp in the U.S., with plans to both shrink coal and grow renewables by 50% each by 2030. This would drive an 80% emissions reduction, while supporting high single-digit earnings growth at a double-digit return.”11. United Parcel Service, Inc.

Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”10. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of November 4: 3.46%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company, is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. October 27, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) declared a $0.50 per average diluted share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 19, to shareholders of record on November 11. Share repurchase authorization of $4 billion was also announced, and it is expected to be concluded by Q4 2022.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares worth $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of November 4: 4.82%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology company, operating through four business segments – Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing.

The dividend is distributable on December 10, to shareholders of record on November 10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the highest yielding technology dividend stocks. On October 17, Stifel analyst David Grossman reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) but trimmed the price target on the stock to $140 from $150. IBM is defensive and likely affected less than most large-cap tech, but it is not immune to weak GDP growth and foreign exchange headwinds, said the analyst. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 funds reported owning stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) at the end of June 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a global pharmaceutical company focused on oncology, respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolism drugs. Despite incremental positive news flow, shares were hurt by the broader flight out of European stocks and the decline in the British Pound that started late in the quarter. We retain conviction in AstraZeneca given its best-in-class growth profile combined with its strong pipeline and commercial launch characteristics. We highlight breast cancer drugs Enhertu and Dato-DXd as two promising near-term opportunities.”7.

Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.5 million shares worth $542 million. Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund has to say about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Within technology and communication services, we own a number of online businesses and semiconductor related companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments. Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions. This is because online businesses, as well as semiconductor companies, benefit from economies of scale. An online search and advertising engine will, in general, be more profitable per unit of cost as it grows larger in terms of users and advertising dollars. It is a hub-and-spoke model, in other words, where it is generally not necessary to grow expenses at the same rate that revenues grow beyond a certain threshold. Therefore, returns on capital tend to be higher, the larger and more dominant the online search company is.”6. AT&amp;T Inc.

(NYSE and SIX: ZBH), a global medical technology leader, today announced one-year data from a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of mymobility® with Apple Watch, a first-of-its-kind remote care management platform. The data show that using mymobility with Apple Watch following primary knee arthroplasty, commonly known as knee replacement, can effectively guide rehabilitation, demonstrate similar outcomes to traditional care models, and significantly reduce the number of outpatient physical therapy (PT) visits. In addition, use of mymobility with Apple Watch was associated with significantly fewer surgery-related emergency department (ED) visits, which could translate to lower costs of care*. The data will be presented at a podium session at the 2022 annual meeting of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS).(PRNewsfoto/Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.)""We're encouraged to find that positive early results from our 90-day analysis were sustained at the one-year follow up and continue to reinforce that a mymobility-based remote care regimen could yield comparable patient outcomes and potentially require fewer healthcare resources than a traditional care model,"" said David A. Crawford, MD, one of the study's lead investigators and a joint replacement specialist at JIS Orthopedics in New Albany, Ohio. ""With smartphone-based remote care, patients tend to be more actively engaged in their recovery through access to real-time data to track their progress, and with the ability to communicate with their care teams more easily through messaging and virtual visits. In the study, these benefits may have contributed to lower utilization of healthcare resources, which can result in cost savings per episode of care.""Story continuesThe data presented at the 2022 AAHKS annual meeting evaluated 401 patients who underwent total or partial knee arthroplasty. Patients were randomized to a mymobility with Apple Watch exercise and educational platform group, or a control group who received traditional care. Among the outcomes assessed at the one-year follow-up were Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR), PT visits, readmissions, and ED/urgent care (UC) visits.Key data findings include:Patients in the mymobility with Apple Watch group who did not require adjunct PT had significantly higher KOOS, JR scores compared to controls at one year post-operatively (89.3±11.3 vs 83.8±14.6, p=0.02).Significantly fewer patients in the mymobility with Apple Watch group required post-operative physical therapy (60.6% vs. 94.6%, p&lt;0.001).Overall KOOS, JR scores were similar between control group and mymobility with Apple Watch group at one year (83.8±14.6 vs 84.1 ±14.0, p=0.88).The change in KOOS, JR scores from pre-operative levels were similar at one year for the control group and the mymobility with Apple Watch group (32.1±17.4 vs 31.5±17.1 points, p=0.51).Significantly fewer patients in the mymobility with Apple Watch group utilized surgery-related ED/UC care compared to the control group (1.3% vs 5.4%, p=0.03).Similar rates of readmission were observed between the mymobility with Apple Watch group and the control group (3.8% vs 2.1%, p=0.36).""The past two years have brought into greater focus the benefits and conveniences of remote care, which is rapidly becoming the new normal for many people around the world,"" said Nitin Goyal, M.D., Chief Science, Technology and Innovation Officer at Zimmer Biomet. ""By undertaking a large randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes associated with a smartphone-based remote care model versus a traditional care model, Zimmer Biomet is proud to be at the forefront of efforts to validate platforms, like mymobility with Apple Watch, as a viable alternative to the standard of care.""About mymobility® with Apple Watchmymobility with Apple Watch and iPhone acts as a virtual care team member by providing patients with support and guidance at the direction of their healthcare professional as they prepare for and recover from orthopedic procedures from the comfort of their home. For patients who have a compatible smartphone, and who are clinically suited for remote care, mymobility leverages the powerful sensors on Apple Watch and iPhone to measure a patient's activity (e.g., number of steps, walking asymmetry, walking speed, flights of stairs) and post-operative progress. mymobility with Apple Watch also enables virtual connections between patients and healthcare professionals throughout the surgical episode of care, with the goal of lowering the overall cost of care. Pre- and post-operative data collected by mymobility with Apple Watch can also be combined with intra-operative data from patients who undergo joint replacement with ROSA® Robotics and is then seamlessly consolidated and analyzed to uncover new clinical insights throughout the episode of care and to help surgeons and care teams make informed patient care decisions.

This compares to earnings of $0.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this energy and utility holding company would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.30, delivering a surprise of 3.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.PPL , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2.13 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.51 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PPL shares have lost about 11.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for PPL?While PPL has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PPL: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.28 on $1.59 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.40 on $6.72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the broader Zacks Utilities sector, Northwest Natural (NWN), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 8.This natural gas distributor is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Northwest Natural's revenues are expected to be $105.88 million, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.9%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderOccidental’s third-quarter earnings are expected to have been driven by strong production from its domestic assets, with a robust contribution from the Permian Basin.Contributions from the Gulf of Mexico and International assets are likely to have boosted the performance of the company in the third quarter. Oil from the Horn Mountain West field offshore Gulf of Mexico is expected to have boosted production volumes in the reported quarter.However, lower sulfur prices are likely to have impacted the midstream business in the third quarter.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter crude oil production is pegged at 620 thousand barrels of oil per day. For natural gas, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1,679 thousand cubic feet per day.Occidental expects total production of 1,140-1,170 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) and output from Permian Resources of 523-533 MBOE/d.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Occidental this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here, as you see below.

One popular account type: a certificate of deposit (CD). These accounts are usually offered at most banks and credit unions and come in all shapes and sizes.In exchange for putting your funds in a CD and agreeing to leave that money untouched for a certain amount of time, you’ll benefit from a higher APY than you'd get with a savings account. For anyone who struggles with dipping into their savings account from time to time, this could be your best bet for hitting some of your financial goals. And some CD term lengths can be as short as a few days, or as long as 10 years. If you’re looking for something a little longer-term—we’ve got you covered with our list of five-year CDs.The Fortune Recommends editorial team ranked more than 40 CDs with five-year terms and came up with a list of our top 10 picks. We weighed minimum deposits to open an account, annual percentage yields (APYs), compounding frequency, and customer service options. (Read our full methodology here.)Ally BankSynchrony BankCFG BankBread SavingsPrime Alliance BankQuontic BankTAB BankPenFed Credit UnionCapital OneBarclays BankWhat is a 5-year CD?Are CD rates going up?Our methodologyThe top 10 5-year CD ratesHere is our list of the best five-year CDs according to Fortune Recommends editors. Note: Minimum deposit requirements, APYs, and other numbers in our list are up to date as of Nov. 3, 2022, but are subject to change.1. Ally Bank: For savers who don’t want to be tied to a minimum balanceKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $05-year APY: 4.10%Penalty: The early withdrawal penalty for CDs with term lengths of 49 months or longer is 150 days of interest.Why we picked it: Ally Bank is an online-only bank that offers checking and savings accounts, credit cards, home and auto financing and more. Its 5-year CD rate currently sits at 4.10%, which is one of the higher rates on our list. Ally Bank requires no minimum deposit, so even new savers can choose how much they feel comfortable setting aside, while still benefiting from Ally’s competitive interest rate. Interest on these CDs compounds daily, and customer service reps are available 24/7 via phone, chat, or email.Story continues2. Synchrony Bank: For savers who are ready to lock up their funds and forget about them until their CD maturesKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $05-year APY: 4.26%Penalty: CDs with term lengths of 48 months or longer are subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 365 days of simple interest at the current rate.Why we picked it: Synchrony Bank is an online-only bank that looks to provide low-cost products to consumers by skipping the traditional brick-and-mortar model. Synchrony’s five-year CD took second place on our list because it has a slightly lower customer service score than our top pick. Still, this account boasts an even higher APY at 4.26% and doesn’t require a minimum opening deposit.The early withdrawal penalty is more than double Ally Bank's, so savers should be mindful and select this account only if they are serious about not touching their funds. Synchrony customers can reach out via chat or automated phone service 24/7 for assistance. To speak with a live representative, Synchrony’s phone lines are open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST, or weekends from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST.3. CFG Bank: For savers who want to know which account has the highest APYKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $5005-year APY: 4.30%Penalty: There is an early withdrawal penalty equal to 180 days’ interest.Why we picked it: CFG Bank is a Maryland-based bank that offers online accounts to customers across the U.S. Its five-year CD boasts the highest APY on our list at 4.30%. For savers looking to take advantage of recent rate hikes and higher APYs, this account may be a solid contender. Interest on this CD compounds daily, which will give your savings even more opportunities to grow.The downside: This account does require a $500 minimum deposit, and CFG scored lower on our customer service scale: Customers can only get phone and email support Monday through Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. EST.4. Bread Savings: For savers who aren’t new to the savings gameKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $1,5005-year APY: 4.25%Penalty: For terms four years and up, the penalty is 365 days' simple interest.Why we picked it: Bread Savings is an online-only bank that offers CDs and high-yield savings accounts. Bread’s CD account had the highest minimum opening deposit on our list, so this account may not be for newbies still growing their savings. However, this account is tied with Capital One for the third-highest APY on our list. Interest on this CD compounds daily, and customers aren’t charged for monthly maintenance.Because Bread Savings doesn’t have any physical locations, this account is best suited for savers who prefer online or mobile banking. For assistance, customers can contact Bread Savings via chat support or by telephone on weekdays between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST, and weekends and most holidays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST.5. Prime Alliance Bank: For savers who don’t plan to make frequent customer service callsKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $5005-year APY: 4.00%Penalty: This account is subject to an early withdrawal penalty of three months’ interest on the amount withdrawn.Why we picked it: Prime Alliance Bank, headquartered in Woods Cross, Utah, offers checking, savings, money market accounts, and more. Customers across the nation can do their banking online or via Prime Alliance’s mobile app. This CD boasts a 4.00% APY and requires a minimum deposit of $500. Interest compounds daily. For assistance, customers can reach a representative over the phone Monday through Friday, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (MST) or via email.6. Quontic Bank: For savers who enjoy fintech perks but still want a community-bank feelKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $5005-year APY: 3.95%Penalty: For CDs with terms over 24 months, the early withdrawal penalty is equal to two years' interest. If the accrued interest is greater than the penalty amount, the remaining interest over the penalty amount will be paid to you. If the accrued interest is less than the penalty amount, the rest may be taken from your principal balance.Why we picked it: Quontic began as a community bank in New York City in 2009 and is now a full-fledged digital-first bank. It identifies as a hybrid between a community bank, a fintech, and a neobank, with product offerings including checking and savings accounts as well as home loans. Quontic’s 5-year CD offers a 3.95% APY and requires a $500 minimum deposit. Interest on this CD compounds daily. Customer service representatives are available via email or telephone, Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST.7. TAB Bank: For savers who like to keep their checking and savings in one placeKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $1,0005-year APY: 4.00%Penalty: This account is subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 180 days’ interest on the amount withdrawn subject to penalty.Why we picked it: TAB Bank is a Utah-based, online-only bank that opened in 1998 and offers online and mobile banking. It offers a number of personal banking products including checking accounts, high-yield savings, money market accounts, and CDs. This CD does require a higher minimum deposit at $1,000, however the 4.00% APY may be worth it for some savers. Interest on these accounts compounds daily. Customer service representatives are available via phone, Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. MST and 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. MST on Saturdays.8. PenFed Credit Union: For savers who like having the best of both banks and credit unionsKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $1,0005-year APY: 3.65%Penalty: If the certificate is redeemed within the first year, all dividends will be forfeited. If after the first year, but prior to the maturity date, the early withdrawal penalty will equal 30% of what would have been earned if the certificate had been held to maturity, not to exceed total dividends earned.Why we picked it: Pentagon Federal Credit Union (PenFed) is a credit union based in Virginia that offers online banking options in addition to a few brick-and-mortar locations across the U.S. Its CD made our list thanks to its 3.65% APY, daily compounding frequency, and stellar customer service score. For customers who prefer a credit union over a traditional bank, while also having access to a mobile banking platform, PenFed may be a viable option.Heads up: PenFed's early withdrawal penalty is one of the more strict penalties on our list. Touching your funds early could mean forfeiting all of your dividends. Customers can contact PenFed by email, chat, or phone Monday to Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. EST; 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. EST on Saturday; and 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. EST on Sunday.9. Capital One: For savers who appreciate extended customer service hoursKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $05-year APY: 4.25%Penalty: For a CD with a term greater than 12 months, the penalty is six months of interest regardless of when you redeem the account prior to maturity.Why we picked it: Headquartered in Virginia, Capital One is one of the largest banks in the U.S., with brick-and-mortar locations, a vast network of over 70,000 ATMs, and online and mobile banking platforms. Capital One’s CD scored a spot on our list thanks to its high APY, well over 4%, and zero opening deposit requirement.A few drawbacks include a lower compounding frequency than some of the other accounts on our list (interest on CDs compounds monthly) and no email support. Capital One does offer chat and phone support from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST, seven days a week.10. [hotlink]Barclays[/hotlink] Bank: For savers who don't mind banking across the pondKey numbers Minimum opening deposit: $05-year APY: 3.65%Penalty: For a CD account with a term of more than 24 months, a penalty equaling 180 days' simple interest on the dollar amount withdrawn subject to penalty will be imposed.Why we picked it: [hotlink ignore=true]Barclays[/hotlink] Bank is based in the U.K., but open to U.S. customers who want to open an online account. Its CD offers customers a 3.65% rate, which is on the lower end compared to other accounts on our list. However, the $0 minimum deposit makes this an attractive option for savers who are just getting started. Interest on these accounts is compounded monthly and customers can reach a representative for assistance 24/7 via phone.What is a 5-year CD?A five-year CD is essentially a savings account that ties up your money for five years (or 60 months) in exchange for a competitive APY. The catch: You agree to not make a withdrawal until your account reaches its maturity date at the end of your term, or you're forced to pay a penalty. CDs come with a wide range of term lengths, and five-year CDs tend to be the longest term length offered by financial institutions, although some banks and credit unions offer longer terms.When your maturity date rolls around, you can choose what to do with your principal balance and any interest you earned over the course of those five years. Some savers might be ready to spend, or they might choose to roll over their funds into a new CD or a high-yield savings account.Are CD rates going up?The short answer is: It depends. The Fed just raised the federal funds rate for the sixth time this year. While this rate doesn’t directly change the interest rate on savings products, banks and credit unions tend to raise rates on their savings products when this happens, to attract new customers. When the federal funds rate goes up, borrowing becomes more expensive and consumers are more likely to hold off on financing major purchases with loans or lines of credit. When spenders become savers, banks try to make it worth their while by raising APYs on deposit products.However, this isn’t universal truth across all deposit accounts, so be sure to read the fine print and shop around to make sure you secure the highest APY on a CD.Our methodologyThe Fortune RecommendsTM team compared five-year certificates of deposit (CDs) from more than 50 major banks, credit unions, and online-only banks. Our top picks are available across the U.S., so you can sign up for an account no matter where you’re located.We ranked the best five-year CDs on the following categories:Five-year term (50%): This number represents the real rate of return on your balance; the higher the APY, the better.Minimum deposit requirement (30%): In order to open a CD at any financial institution, it will require that you deposit a minimum dollar amount.Compound frequency (15%): Interest on deposit accounts like CDs can compound daily or monthly. The more frequency interest compounds on your CD, the better.Customer service (5%): Top picks offer customers various ways to get in contact: chat support, by phone, or even email; phone support was most highly rated by our team.The best CDs offer APYs twice the national average. We didn’t include brokered CDs on our list, which are sold on the secondary market through brokerages instead of banks and can be riskier because of this.The rates, fees, and minimum deposit requirements for CDs are available for limited time periods, and APYs are subject to fluctuation, which could impact how much interest you earn. All the bank and credit unions on this list are insured by the FDIC and NCUA respectively.

They would have to rise by more than 200,000 bags though,"" said a Europe-based trader at a global trade house.Certified stocks are a strong driver of ICE coffee prices because, unlike other factors, they are visible to all on a daily basis and many algorithmic funds are pre-programmed to buy when they fall and sell when they rise.The coffee crop in Brazil, responsible for around 40% of global arabica production, could grow by as much as 10% in 2023 due to favourable weather in recent months, analysts say.Story continuesThat should push prices for exchange-grade Brazilian coffee, known as 'semi-washed', down to levels where it becomes economical to deliver the beans to ICE - a market of last resort at times when there is excess supply.Traders said physical prices for Brazilian semi-washed coffee dipped in September to levels where exchange deliveries became economical, but the fall was short-lived, hence just 250,000 bags are at or heading to exchange depots to be certified this year.Next year, those numbers could swell if the favourable weather in Brazil holds up and demand remains depressed due to the economic downturn.""Demand is very, very quiet. No one wants to buy, roasters are stepping out the market. Whoever (has) coffee wants to get out so the only natural buyer is (exchange participants),"" said another Europe-based trader.(Reporting by Maytaal Angel and Marcelo Teixera; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported a loss of $1.09 per share.In the third quarter, total revenues were $57.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51 million.Revenues were up 23.5% year over year, driven by commercial revenues and royalties from NerlynxTotal revenues comprised net product sales of Nerlynx (neratinib), Puma Biotech's only marketed drug in the United States, and license fees and royalty revenues from PBYI’s sub-licensees. Nerlynx is indicated for treating early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.Quarter in DetailProduct revenues from Nerlynx were $54.3 million in the third quarter, up 25.1% year over year, driven by improved demand trends. Nerlynx’s product revenues were much better than management’s guidance of $44 million-$47 million.Royalty revenues were $2.8 million in the quarter, same as the year-ago quarter. Puma Biotech did not record any license revenues in the third quarter.Total operating costs in the quarter were $54.7 million, up 0.9% year over year. Research and development expenses were $11.2 million in the quarter, down 40% year over year, primarily due to a decline in clinical trial expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 8% year over year to $24.0 million due to lower professional fees and expenses.2022 GuidancePuma Biotech raised Nerlynx’s product sales guidance range to $194-$196 million from $180-$190 million to reflect improving demand trends for the drug in the United States.Puma Biotechnology’s shares were up 10.8% after-market on Nov 3 due to the better-than-expected Nerlynx sales in the quarter and the guidance increase.

Data from a cohort of the SUMMIT study, which evaluated a combination of neratinib, fulvestrant and trastuzumab in patients with HR-positive, HER-negative, HER2-mutant metastatic breast cancer, showed that the combination achieved an objective response rate of 35.3% at a median progression-free survival of 8.2 months. Puma plans to hold a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2023 to discuss these results and intends to seek approval in this indication under the accelerated pathway.The company plans to report data from another cohort of the SUMMIT study evaluating Nerlynx in non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR exon 18 mutations and hold a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss the potential for an accelerated approval pathway for this indication in the first half of 2023.Later this year, Puma Biotech plans to release results from two cohorts of the phase II TBCRC-022 study on Nerlynx in combination with Roche’s Kadcyla in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastases, previously treated with Kadcyla.In September, Puma Biotech in-licensed global development and commercialization rights to alisertib, an aurora kinase A inhibitor, from Japan’s Takeda.

Earnings were flat year over year as lower revenues were offset by lower costs.Revenues for the third quarter came in at $3.6 billion, which also missed the consensus estimate of $3.86 billion as well as our estimate of $3.87 billion. Total revenues declined 8% on a reported basis due to currency headwinds. Revenues were hurt by currency changes due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar as around 47% of Teva’s revenues come from sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.On a constant-currency basis, sales declined 2%.Segment DiscussionThe company reports through the following segments based on three regions — North America (comprising the United States and Canada), Europe and International markets.North America segment sales were $1.81 billion, down 4% year over year due to lower sales of Copaxone, Bendeka/Treanda as well as generic products. In the United States, sales declined 4% from the prior-year quarter to $1.69 billion. Revenues in the North America segment missed our estimates of $1.88 billion.Copaxone posted sales of $105 million in North America, down 21% year over year due to generic erosion in the United States and lower market share due to increased competition.Combined sales of Bendeka and Treanda declined 20% from the year-ago quarter to $77 million. Sales of Bendeka and Treanda were hurt due to the availability of alternative therapies and continued competitive pressure.Austedo recorded sales of $260 million in North America, up 30% year over year due to volume growth as prescription trends continue to grow.Ajovy, Teva’s migraine treatment, recorded sales of $57 million for the quarter, up 23% year over year, driven by higher volumes.Generic/biosimilar product revenues declined 6% from the year-ago period to $806 million in the North America segment due to increased competition. The North America Generic revenues were less than our estimates of $902 million.Story continuesDistribution revenues, generated by Anda, rose 2% year over year for the quarter to $371 million due to higher demand.The Europe segment recorded revenues of $1.07 billion, down 12% year over year on a reported basis due to currency headwinds. Sales rose 1% in constant currency, driven by higher demand for generic and OTC products and higher sales of new generic products.In the International Markets segment, sales declined 10% year over year to $475 million. In constant currency terms, sales declined 3% from a year ago due to the recognition of a $35 million milestone payment received from partner Otsuka in Japan in the year-ago quarter.The Other segment (comprising the API manufacturing business and certain contract manufacturing services) recorded revenues of $241 million, down 8% year over year on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency terms.Costs DiscussionAdjusted gross margin declined 60 basis points (bps) to 53% for the quarter.Adjusted research &amp; development expenses declined 21.1% year over year to $171 million due to a decline in the neuroscience, immunology and generic area and an accounting adjustment related to a contract with an R&amp;D partner, which offset higher costs related to biosimilar pipeline candidate projects. Selling and marketing expenditure declined 10% from the year-ago level to $510 million. General and administrative expenses declined 9% from the prior-year level to $250 million.Adjusted operating income declined 6% year over year in the quarter to $977 million due to lower gross profit. The adjusted operating margin rose 40 bps to 27.2% in the quarter.2022 Guidance LoweredTeva lowered its revenue guidance from a range of $15.0 billion - $15.6 billion to $14.8 billion - $15.4 billion, mainly due to currency headwinds.Sales of Copaxone in all regions are expected to be approximately $700 million (same as before).Teva maintained its Ajovy and Austedo revenue guidance of approximately $400 million and approximately $1.0 billion, respectively.Adjusted earnings guidance was maintained the range of $2.40-$2.60 per share. Adjusted operating income is still expected in the range of $4.2-$4.5 billion.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14% compared with 13% to 14% guided previously.Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $1.9-$2.2 billion (maintained).Our TakeFor the third quarter, Teva missed estimates for earnings as well as sales. It also lowered its total revenue guidance for the third time this year. Teva’s shares were down 1.7% on Nov 3 due to the dismal earnings performance and the guidance cut.Teva’s share price has risen 6.9% this year so far against the industry’s 29.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTeva is seeing continued growth of Austedo prescriptions and market share growth for key growth driver, Ajovy. Revenues of generic products are improving in some countries like Europe and International markets. However, a strong foreign exchange headwind is hurting the top lineIn July, Teva reached a $4.25 billion nationwide settlement in principle to resolve most of its opioid-related litigation. However, the agreement is pending participation by states and subdivisions. The required number of states and local governments need to agree to deal terms before the settlement can be finalized. Teva is optimistic that it will see a high participation rate in this nationwide settlement to fully resolve the lawsuits. Also, along with the earnings release, Teva announced that it has reached a settlement with the state of New York, which ends the opioid litigation in the state.The nationwide settlement for the costly opioid litigations removes a significant overhang for Teva.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola Consolidated with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated Coca-Cola Consolidated's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Coca-Cola Consolidated's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Coca-Cola Consolidated's EPS skyrocketed from US$25.25 to US$35.29, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a fantastic gain of 40%.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Coca-Cola Consolidated remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 11% to US$6.0b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile it's always good to see growing profits, you should always remember that a weak balance sheet could come back to bite. So check Coca-Cola Consolidated's balance sheet strength, before getting too excited.Story continuesAre Coca-Cola Consolidated Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that Coca-Cola Consolidated insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.1b. That equates to 25% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.Should You Add Coca-Cola Consolidated To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Coca-Cola Consolidated's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Coca-Cola Consolidated , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Their portfolios have an average value of $109,000 while the average portfolio of those under 35 is worth $7,360. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBeginner investors should buy time-tested stocks. That means they should skew toward blue-chip firms and let the power of compounding do its magic. Although they have more time until they retire and thus a greater ability to absorb risk, slow and steady will win the race for them.AAPLApple$139GOOG,GOOGLAlphabet$83.50VVisa$195QQQInvesco QQQ Trust Series$261COSTCostco$487JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$171MELIMercadoLibre$871 Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done it again, to no one’s surprise. Its stock has risen on news of yet another quarterly record revenue . While competitors’ sales languish as consumer spending slows and recession fears ramp up, Apple continues to post impressive results. The world’s most valuable firm by market capitalization generated a record $90.1 billion of revenue last quarter. Apple’s iPhones accounted for $42.6 billion of that $90.1 billion of revenues, as iPhone revenue jumped nearly 10% year-over-year. So Apple continues to be the strongest of the tech giants as others falter. AAPL stock is an excellent choice for beginner investors because of its tremendous stability in an otherwise volatile tech sector. Further, it provides a dividend of 23 cents that management continues to grow. AAPL stock currently has a dividend yield of 0.54%. That is relatively low. However, the company has increased its dividend by an annual average of 9.5% over the past five years. Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is among the faltering tech giants mentioned in the paragraph above. So it’s somewhat curious that  I’m recommending it at this point. And unlike Apple, Alphabet did not report strong Q3 results at all. Google’s bread and butter is advertising revenues from its search engine, YouTube ad revenue, and its cloud business. Alphabet reported its earnings last week on Oct. 25. And its ad revenues were very problematic, rising only 2.5% YOY. Analysts, on average, expected the company to report $56.9 billion of ad revenue, so the $54.48 billion of ad sales that it actually reported was disappointing. YouTube’s ad revenues reached $7.07 billion, well below the $7.5 billion that analysts had anticipated. None of this seems to suggest that GOOG stock is a buy. However, there is a silver lining. Google’s search ads are expected to fare better during the continued economic downturn than direct response and display ads. So the shares may not perform well in the short term, but they should outperform the stocks of other ad giants. A beginner investor who buys GOOG now will get an inexpensive stock which is extremely likely to rebound over time and provide strong returns. Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) stock has short-term and long-term positive catalysts that make it a smart investment for beginner investors. In the short term, it’s clear that credit card spending remains strong. Total credit card balances hit $916 billion in September. That’s a level not seen since before the pandemic. The data point indicates that Americans are spending and borrowing despite increasing fears of recession. Whatever the case, Visa is among the credit card companies that stand to benefit as credit card balances are currently 23% higher than their pandemic low. while its defaults remain below pre-pandemic levels. Beginner investors should also understand that Visa is an excellent long-term choice. Its annual return over the past decade has averaged 19%. Visa stock also  a dividend which yields a modest 0.69%. However, its dividend has grown at an average annual rate of 17.4% over the past five years. Invesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ)Tiles that say ETF on top of stacks of coins on a blue backgroundSource: kenary820 / ShutterstockBeginner investors should buy Invesco QQQ Trust Series (NASDAQ:QQQ) stock. In fact, they would be wise to consider any number of ETFs that are tailored to their individual interests and own stocks in sectors in which they believe strongly. Generally speaking, ETFs provide trading flexibility, diversification, lower costs, and tax benefits, compared to mutual funds. Beginner investors should consider QQQ stock because it provides the benefits listed above. Further, because QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index. the ETF also provides exposure to the tech-heavy Nasdaq. As a result, investors will get exposure to the best tech stocks, including Apple, Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). A beginner investor who owns QQQ will learn, among other things, about interest rates and their effects on the tech sector.  The price of QQQ is low now but will rise in time when the Fed ultimately slows its quantitative tightening process. So the long-term outlook of QQQ is bright. Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comIt’s reasonable to argue that buying Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock now isn’t a great idea. The bulk wholesaler has received a lot of attention as  worries about inflation  have risen in 2022. Consumers are looking for ways to ease the burden of inflation. And bulk buying is an obvious means of doing so. So it’s no surprise that investors have flocked to COST stock, causing it to rise. That has left many pundits arguing that Costco stock is overpriced. They have a reasonable argument because Costco’s P/E ratio of 38.7 is higher than that of 84% of defensive-retail stocks. But there are many equally reasonable arguments against the idea that Costco is overpriced. For example, its return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital are all better than 90% of those of other companies in the defensive-retail sector. That suggests Costco is fairly priced. It’s a great stock and is likely to continue rising as the economy worsens on rising 2023 recession fears. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comBeginner investors should consider a strong healthcare stock like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Healthcare stocks tend to do well during recessions, making JNJ a good choice now. Further, Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently particularly well-positioned. The company is flush with cash after raking in loads of money from the sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and other products. It has approximately $34 billion of cash on hand. That gives JNJ the ability to buy other pharma companies whose valuations have dropped sharplyBut Johnson &amp; Johnson is not jumping to make acquisitions. It remains focused on the  spin off of its consumer business, Kenvue, which is slated to occur next year. JNJ can afford to wait before making acquisitions because a recession appears more and more likely to occur next year. JNJ stock has every chance to rise, management will keep the company stable at worst, and investors will get dividends in the meantime. So there’s a lot to like about JNJ. MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has been described as the Amazon of Latin America. MELI is an eCommerce platform based in Uruguay with operations that span Mexico, Central America, and all of South America. Amazon was founded in 1994 and MercadoLibre was launched in 1999. So the two aren’t very different in age. However, MercadoLibre might be able to grow more rapidly going forward. And its shares have provided massive annual average returns of 26.14% over the past ten years. Amazon, on the other hand, has provided slightly lower average annual returns of 25.84%.MELI stock is deeply undervalued, according to most Wall Street analysts. More than 20 analysts currently cover MercadoLibre. The vast majority of them rate the shares a “buy.” Their average price target on the shares is $870. The company is growing at breakneck  speed, as its annual average EBITDA growth over the last three years is 154%, and its revenue that has grown by an average of 64% annually in the same period. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

298,51995e73-75f5-3406-8d77-faeaf72c13a7,SYK,2022-11-05,Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after Stryker Corporation's (NYSE:SYK) latest 8.0% drop adds to a year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-110039142.html,1667646039,STORY,['SYK'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$80b last week after a 8.0% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 23% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Stryker's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Stryker, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Stryker ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Stryker?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Stryker does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Stryker's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Stryker. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder. Ronda Stryker, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of StrykerThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Stryker Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$8.9b stake in this US$80b business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Stryker. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Stryker better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Stryker   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

High raw material costs are hurting the margins of industry players. Labor shortages remain a perennial problem for the industry. Amid growing recessionary fears, a slowdown in manufacturing activities adds to the worries in the industry.However, strength across end-markets is expected to support growth of Honeywell International HON, General Electric GE and 3M Company MMM.About the IndustryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end-markets, including oil &amp; gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction, and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines, and engineered fluid-process equipment. The industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. In addition, a few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets, and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Diversified Operations IndustrySupply Chain &amp; Cost Woes: Supply chain disruptions, especially those related to the shortage of semiconductor chips, are hurting the operations of industry players. Delay in the delivery of products is weighing on production volumes, thus impacting margins. The persistent shortage of labor and high raw material costs are added concerns for the industry, posing a threat to the bottom-line performance of companies. Pricing actions and cost-control measures are helping industry players tackle the adversities.Slowdown in Manufacturing Activities: Amid growing inflation and persistent supply chain challenges, manufacturing activities are slowing down, indicating softness in customer demand. In October, the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 50.2%, dipping 0.7 percentage point from the September reading. This was due to a decline in New Orders and New Export Orders Index. Amid growing uncertainty surrounding the economy, the demand environment is expected to remain volatile in the near term. Nevertheless, despite a slowdown, the manufacturing index remained above 50%, indicating continued expansion in manufacturing activities. This should help the industry participants stay afloat despite the slowdown in the manufacturing sector.Strength Across Various End-Markets: Although there is some softness in demand, with continued expansion in manufacturing activities, the industry is seeing sustained demand across its various end-markets, such as chemical and industrial pumps, commercial aerospace and defense, rail and electric vehicles. Companies with exposure to the life sciences vertical should benefit from robust activity in the bioprocessing business, and strength in instrument businesses, while those with exposure to the diagnostics vertical should gain from healthy demand for products related to respiratory testing. Companies offering construction materials are expected to benefit from the strengthening reroofing market in the United States, owing to new construction activity.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168. This rank places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group’s 2022 earnings per share has decreased 9.5% over the past year.Despite the industry’s drab near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks that you may hold in your portfolios.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have both recently outlined fears of a sharp slowdown in the economy as the central bank continues with an aggressive rate hike policy intended to curb inflation by raising borrowing costs. Solomon recently said that economic conditions would tighten meaningfully, noting that “until you get to that point where you see a change in labor or demand, you are going to see central banks continue to move on that trajectory”. Meanwhile, Dimon has also echoed these comments, noting that excess money was running out for American consumers. Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), and Prologis, Inc.

TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. (NYSE:TRTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13    TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. (NYSE:TRTX) a commercial real estate finance company that originates, acquires, and manages commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments in the United States. It is one of the top strong buy stocks to invest in.

The company placed $907 million of investment-grade bonds with institutional investors. On October 18, Raymond James maintained a Strong Buy rating on TPG RE Finance Trust (NYSE:TRTX) stock with a price target of $11.5.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, California-based investment firm Brevan Howard is a leading shareholder in TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. (NYSE:TRTX) with 707,942 shares worth more than $6.4million. 12. Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14     Redwood Trust, Inc.

(NYSE:RWT), compared to 16 in the previous quarter worth $75 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We took advantage of the selloff in the financials sector to add a new position in Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT). The company operates as a speciality finance company within the residential mortgage banking and business purpose mortgage banking industries and capitalized as large investment banks shed their mortgage securitization businesses after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Redwood has since expanded to become the industry leader in the distribution of loans through whole loan sales.Additionally, its investment portfolio has been very strong historically, even in the GFC, and its expansion into banking has made it better. We believe that the company’s long-term value creation is substantially underrepresented in its current market price and look forward to it being a high-quality long-term compounder within the portfolio.”11. Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17     Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) provides commercial real estate services under the Cushman &amp; Wakefield brand. It is one of the premier strong buy stocks to invest in. On August 8, Cushman &amp; Wakefield revealed that it has acquired Burbage Realty Partners, a specialist in UK logistics and industrial.

Here is what the fund said:“U.S.-domiciled Cushman &amp; Wakefield plc (NYSE:CWK) is one of the largest companies in the commercial real estate brokerage industry, a sector that is consolidating as scale has differentiated large competitors from their smaller peers. This has enabled large industry participants, such as Cushman &amp; Wakefield, to gain significant market share in transactional business lines like leasing brokerage and capital markets while simultaneously building significant outsourcing businesses with contractual revenue streams. We expect the company to continue growing its market share over time as economies of scale also drive gradual improvement in profit margins. Despite this strong outlook, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is trading at a mid-single-digit multiple of current-year earnings—a material discount to the broad market and its large brokerage peers. We see this as an opportunity to own a high-quality, well-managed company at a bargain price.”10. Hancock Whitney Corporation (NYSE:HWC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22   Hancock Whitney Corporation (NYSE:HWC) operates as the financial holding company for Hancock Whitney Bank that provides traditional and online banking services to commercial, small business, and retail customers.

(NYSE:T) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“I purchased shares of AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) prior to its spin-off of Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD). Most people are probably familiar with AT&amp;T. They are a major cellular service provider, and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets, which include HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, DC Comics and the Batman content brands, and more. At the time of my purchase, I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield, or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD, which now has HBO Max, has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then, Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth, which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings.As a result, shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present, but we may add to it over time.”7. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25     PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) designs, manufactures and distributes light, medium, and heavy-duty commercial trucks internationally. It is one of the major strong buy stocks to invest in. On September 27, PACCAR declared that its new parts distribution center in Kentucky is now fully operational.

(NYSE:PCAR) stock and increased the price target to $105 From $100.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 25 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $326.9 million in PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR), compared to 30 in the preceding quarter worth $253.2 million.In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We added just one new position to the portfolio during the third quarter: PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR). We believe Paccar is a well-managed, high-quality global commercial vehicle manufacturer that trades at a low multiple of normalized earnings. Paccar has consistently grown its earnings power via market share gains, improved margins and above-average growth of its highly profitable parts and services business. Despite operating in a cyclical industry, the company has been profitable for 82 consecutive years while steadily generating higher peak and trough EPS through each successive cycle. We had the opportunity to purchase Paccar at what we believe is an attractive price due to transitory concerns related to Covid-19-induced supply chain pressures, elevated cyclical uncertainty and the longer-term impact of powertrain electrification on the business. We believe our long-time horizon provides a significant advantage as we can look through the short-term headwinds and focus more on what Paccar should earn on a mid-cycle basis. Furthermore, while we do expect increased commercial vehicle electrification over time, we believe the company is well positioned to integrate new propulsion systems to meet customer demands.”6.

(NYSE:EL) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of December to $0.66. This takes the annual payment to 1.3% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Estée Lauder Companies' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, Estée Lauder Companies' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 58.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.525 total annually to $2.64. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 18% per annum over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Estée Lauder Companies has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 10% per annum. Estée Lauder Companies definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Estée Lauder Companies Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Estée Lauder Companies is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

(See chart on the following page.)Integrating climate risk into our strategy and investmentsUnderpinning our strategy is the in-depth analysis we conducted in 2020 - and updated and expanded in 2022 - to understand the climate-related risks and opportunities facing our company. We studied their potential impacts on our business, operations and the broader environment in which we work under different warming scenarios.While there is considerable uncertainty about the likelihood and operational and financial consequences of these scenarios, the direction and potential magnitude of climate-related risk is clear. Our strategy is designed to position American to anticipate, mitigate and respond to climate-related risks and to thrive in an uncertain future. It includes making targeted investments to address the demonstrated and high-probability risks associated with climate change that may affect our business, such as the impact of extreme heat on aircraft or of sea level rise at our major hubs. It also includes strategic investments, based on the best available information, to enable American to adapt quickly and be successful if lower-probability or higher consequence risks manifest. As a result, another core part of our strategy is making ongoing investments in deepening our understanding and analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities to inform our evolving approach. For a detailed discussion of our climate-risk assessment process and findings, see page 22.Story continuesAs part of our ongoing analysis of transition climate risks and opportunities, we incorporate a price on carbon when estimating American's potential obligations under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), European Union Emissions Trading System and other possible regulatory programs that may impact our operations. The carbon prices used for these estimates are based on cost projections from respected external sources. We have also begun incorporating a shadow price on carbon in evaluating investments in our fleet and fuel efficiency initiatives, as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchases.Read MoreAmerican Airlines, Friday, November 4, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: https://www.aa.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723962/American-Airlines-Climate-Strategy]"

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Macy's (M) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.22 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 17, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.22 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.19 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Macy's has an Earnings ESP of 18.92%.M is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.O'Reilly Automotive is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 8, 2023. ORLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.71 a share 96 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for O'Reilly Automotive is $7.60, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.46%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, M and ORLY could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The company, which sells supplemental health insurance to Japanese, and less so to U.S. consumers, recently sold roughly $1.21 billion in debt in Japan, taking advantage of the lower cost of capital there as the country's interest rates continue to be in negative territory. CFO Journal spoke to Chief Financial Officer Max Brodén about the considerations for the transaction and what Aflac has done with the proceeds. Edited excerpts follow.WSJ: Aflac recently sold about $1.21 billion in debt to Japanese investors. What was the rationale?Mr. Brodén: It's very natural to finance ourselves in yen because we generate a large percent of our earnings and profits [in Japan]. Our Japan operations hold $24.2 billion of investments. And we have $5 billion of forwards at the holding company that are long dollars and short yen.

The project, as recommended, will provide the region with the reliable, drought-proof water supply it urgently needs.""The Coastal Commission staff completed a comprehensive review and thorough report on the project,"" said Ian Crooks, vice president of engineering for California American Water. ""The staff report recognizes that historic drought conditions are making additional water supplies critical in the coming years and that there are no alternatives to ensure a reliable supply of water except for the desalination project. The report also includes several conditions to ensure that the project’s potential impacts to coastal resources and low-income ratepayers are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. We have worked for the last 10 years with community advocates and stakeholders, cutting edge researchers, coastal experts and industry leading engineers to develop a solution that meets the community’s needs. Moreover, this project will ensure the most vulnerable among us have access to safe, affordable water.""If approved by the Commission, this project would end a decades-long water supply crisis that has affected the Peninsula since the 1990s, limited the building of affordable housing and impacted equitable access to safe water for too long. In 2009, the State Water Resources Control Board issued a cease-and-desist order that placed a building moratorium in much of the area, exacerbating the local housing crisis for working families, including military families stationed in the area and workers in the hospitality industry.Story continues""Today’s news is a relief for the tens of thousands of residents and businesses who have been worried about the future of their water supply,"" said Yvette Padilla, a Castroville community leader. ""Limited water supply has resulted in a building moratorium that has restricted the expansion of affordable housing, has stifled economic growth in the region and has left residents living under the constant threat of water rationing for far too long. The Coastal Commission staff recommendation to approve the MPWSP is the right decision to help our community move forward.""The project has undergone extensive public review since it was proposed to the California Public Utilities Commission in 2012, including numerous stakeholder meetings and public hearings before multiple state and local government agencies. California American Water has held more than two dozen additional meetings and community workshops and conducted further extensive outreach to stakeholders in the region over the last four months to gather additional feedback and inform the public about the project.In response to community input, California American Water recently announced a phased approach to the project to better fit the needs of the region, including in Marina, where the project’s source water slant wells will be located. Under this approach, the first phase of the project would be built to produce 4.8 million gallons per day. In the future, California American Water could seek approval to expand the project if needed to produce up to 6.4 million gallons per day.California American Water also has proposed additional affordability initiatives to ensure that customers needing financial assistance can afford access to adequate water for drinking, sanitation and health needs. In addition to these important project elements, California American Water has reaffirmed its commitment to renewable energy to ensure the desalination facility has net zero GHG emissions, and to expand the existing groundwater monitoring network with the Monterey County Water Resources Agency to ensure that project operation does not harm local groundwater users.About California American Water: California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 725,000 people.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced late-breaking presentations of updated results from two positive pivotal trials investigating novel aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens, compared to EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). The positive data from PHOTON and PULSAR were presented at the 55th Annual Scientific Session of The Retina Society in Pasadena, California.""Investigational aflibercept 8 mg allowed the vast majority of patients to be maintained on extended dosing intervals with outcomes that were generally consistent with EYLEA across time points during the 48-week treatment period,"" said David Brown, M.D., FACS, Director of Research at Retina Consultants of Texas in the U.S. and a trial investigator. ""Together, the PHOTON and PULSAR presentations at Retina Society show aflibercept 8 mg can potentially lead to significant and clinically meaningful outcomes with a reduced treatment burden for patients with diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration.""As previously announced, the presentations at Retina Society showed that the PHOTON trial in DME (N=658) and the PULSAR trial in wAMD (N=1,009) met their primary endpoint, with aflibercept 8 mg demonstrating non-inferior vision gains at 48 weeks with both 12- and 16-week dosing regimens after initial monthly doses, compared to an EYLEA 8-week dosing regimen. Aflibercept 8 mg patients were rapidly initiated on extended dosing regimens and among patients who completed week 48, 93% (n=456) in PHOTON and 83% (n=628) in PULSAR maintained dosing intervals of 12 weeks or more.Story continuesIn addition to data recently shared at the American Association for Ophthalmology Annual Meeting, the new efficacy analyses presented at Retina Society showed aflibercept 8 mg led to similar improvements in certain anatomical measures at 48 weeks, compared to EYLEA, despite extended dosing regimens. For the aflibercept 8 mg 12- and 16-week dosing regimens, respectively, the results showed that:Among wAMD patients, 71% (n=332) and 67% (n=334) had no retinal fluid in the center subfield, compared to 59% for EYLEA (n=335), per a pre-specified analysis of PULSAR. The median time to a fluid-free subfield was 4 weeks for aflibercept 8 mg, compared to 8 weeks for EYLEA.Among DME patients, there was a mean reduction of 14 mm2 (n= 328) and 9 mm2 (n=163) in the total area of fluorescein leakage from baseline, compared to 9 mm2 for EYLEA (n=167), per an exploratory analysis of PHOTON. Reductions in fluorescein leakage, a measure of disease activity, are associated with disease improvement.The safety of aflibercept 8 mg was similar to EYLEA in both trials, and consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials. The most frequent ocular adverse events that occurred more commonly in aflibercept 8 mg versus EYLEA patients in PHOTON (aflibercept 8 mg n=491; EYLEA n=167) were cataract (3% vs. 1%), conjunctival hemorrhage (4% vs. 4%), punctate keratitis (2% vs. &lt;1%), retinal hemorrhage (1% vs. &lt;1%) and vitreous floaters (4% vs. 2%). In PULSAR (aflibercept 8 mg n=673; EYLEA n=336), they were cataract (4% vs. 3%) and intraocular pressure increased (3% vs. 2%). There were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis in either trial.""These data show unprecedented durability of aflibercept 8 mg in patients living with age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, who also experienced significant anatomical improvements at week 48,"" said Jean-François Korobelnik, Professor of Ophthalmology and Head of the Department of Ophthalmology at University Hospital of Bordeaux in France and principal trial investigator.Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA.Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Aflibercept 8 mg Trial ProgramPHOTON in DME and PULSAR in wAMD are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 5 initial monthly doses in PHOTON and 3 in PULSAR. In the first year, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study, with those results still to be assessed. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.The lead sponsors of the trials were Regeneron for PHOTON and Bayer for PULSAR.About DME and wAMDDME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.wAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.1 million Americans have wAMD, and this number is expected to double by 2050.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.""7.

The study exhibited a deep and sustained reduction in mean serum transthyretin (TTR) after single doses of 0.7mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg of NTLA-2001 were administered in 12 patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I – III heart failure. The study achieved mean reductions of 93% and 92% at day 28 in the 0.7 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg cohort, respectively.Story continuesNTLA announced that it has initiated dosing at a 55mg dose, the fixed dose corresponding to 0.7 mg/kg, in part II, the dose-expansion portion of the study.

In an effort to address this disparity, the American Heart Association, the leading public health nonprofit organization dedicated to building a world of longer, healthier lives for all, has announced that 52 students from 23 academic institutions have been selected to participate in its Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Scholars program.The Association's HBCU Scholars are enrolled in biomedical or other health sciences programs at their respective institutions. Through their participation in the Scholars program, they will study how the social determinants of health and other health disparities impact underserved communities. They will also participate in scientific research projects and present their findings at the end of the program.""Since 2015, the American Heart Association HBCU Scholars program has helped change the trajectory of dozens of under-represented students in science and medicine by fostering their talent, preparedness and growth to pursue careers in biomedical science"" said American Heart Association volunteer president Michelle A. Albert, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, who is the Walter A. Haas-Lucie Stern endowed chair in Cardiology, professor of medicine and admissions dean at University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine. ""As champions for health care quality and access for all, the American Heart Association is committed to building the pipeline of diverse persons in medicine and empowering the next generation of research and health care professionals.""The program is funded by a grant provided by the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, which also supports the American Heart Association's Hispanic Serving Institutes (HSI) Scholars Program.""This program plays an essential role in supporting the pipeline of Black students who will increase representation and equity in the health care field,"" said Mandell Jackson, vice president and general manager, Quest for Health Equity, Quest Diagnostics. ""We are proud to support this next cohort of HBCU Scholars with the American Heart Association as it provides them with enriching academic and networking experiences to help them excel in their career paths.""Story continuesAccepted students are selected based on their GPA, completion of a formal application, which includes an essay, and an official recommendation from their school. During the program, scholars are paired with a mentor who works in health care or is currently performing their own relevant scientific research. They will also participate in a leadership development program and are awarded a financial stipend to help cover education-related expenses. More about the American Heart Association's HBCU Scholars initiative can be found here.Clinical research studies published in the American Journal of Public Health suggest that patients of color may experience uncomfortable interactions and communication barriers with their health care providers due to lack of diversity and face implicit and unconscious bias from physicians and other health care professionals. These barriers, in turn, can lower patients' trust in the overall health care system and as a result, these patients may not complete prescribed treatments or follow-up on recommended care. Addressing this issue is a vital component of the HBCU Scholars program.Each year, the Association seeks applications from sophomores, juniors and seniors from historically underrepresented communities who are currently enrolled in an HBCU and are interested in pursuing a professional degree in biomedical and health sciences.Additional Resources:Photo of the 2022 HBCU scholars is on the right column of the release link https://newsroom.heart.org/news/historically-black-colleges-and-universities-stem-students-selected-for-health-care-program?preview=aa86508ce3b4752d1da83b188ca29a7fSpanish news release###About the American Heart AssociationThe American Heart Association is a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.8bUS$16.7bUS$16.6bUS$16.3bUS$17.0bUS$17.2bUS$17.4bUS$17.6bUS$17.9bUS$18.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.91%Est @ 1.23%Est @ 1.46%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$14.7kUS$14.5kUS$13.5kUS$12.3kUS$12.0kUS$11.3kUS$10.7kUS$10.1kUS$9.6kUS$9.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$118bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$358bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$358b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$179bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$297b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$44.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?
