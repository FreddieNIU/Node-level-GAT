Net new assets falling by 48%. Deposits down by 21% Now an interesting quote that I want to pull out from the CEO, he said that no one at Schwab is kidding themselves that everything is perfect here. They know that this is a challenging environment, particularly coming off of these interest rate hikes, hurting their own investments, increasing their own debt while. Consumers meantime see the rate hikes as an opportunity to get returns on a high-yield savings account, maybe to go into bonds like our last guest Kevin was saying. And that's hurting those deposits."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I mean, it's been a rocky time for Schwab. I mean, you remember, of course, got caught up in the regional banking turbulence. You had folks, as you noted, kind of pulling deposits, kind of hunting for those higher yields. So it was a rough 2023. As you mentioned, this report, Q4, you saw net new assets. It looks like fell 48%. Bank deposits dropped 21%. The stock is now down about 25% over the past year. And now maybe that does price in a lot of bad news, because most on the Street must think it is a buy here at these levels."", ""MADISON MILLS: That's interesting to note. I wonder what the analyst recommendation mix looks like there. But it could be one of those situations where now this name is trading at a discount, given that it's at those lows."", ""JOSH LIPTON: It's been clobbered. Moving on to another name that's been hit. Shares of Alibaba other Chinese stocks down today on that weak GDP reading. So this is-- listen, we can talk about Alibaba. But this is a broader story than just that name. It's really about US-listed Chinese stocks. So, yes, Bob, I mean, it's now down about 40% in the past 12 months."", ""If you look at the KraneShares, China internet fund, that's down about 30% in the past 12 months as investors have questions about the Chinese economy. A lot of people were betting on a post-COVID boom there that didn't work out. It's shaky over there."", ""MADISON MILLS: It didn't work out. And it doesn't appear to have any help moving forward. The government has said and China's highest ranking government official since the 2017 visit of Xi Jinping to Davos was there today talking about this. He said that they are not going to be pushing for more stimulus. And that is what the Street is looking for to boost that consumer demand, which is what we're going to have to see, particularly when 2/3 of the Chinese economy of consumers right now is tied up in the property sector. That's not going to leave them with a lot of extra spending in terms of the consumer output of what we're going to see impacting a company here like Alibaba."", ""It's really a perfect storm for deflation in China when you think about the birth declines, the aging population, and just the GDP deflating as well over there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. And, by the way, the Chinese officials, you know, you're referencing making comments in Davos. Remember, those comments coming after China's central bank earlier this week held a key interest rate unchanged. And so perhaps that caused some disappointment for some investors as well who were hoping for bigger action from Chinese authorities."", ""MADISON MILLS: We're going to do a hard pivot here over to Instacart. Instacart is higher today after an analyst at Wolfe Research suggested that the grocery delivery company could be a takeover target for Uber. Wolfe also upgraded the stock to outperform from peer perform and established a $35 price target."", ""Instacart has been one of these names to watch. We've been looking for who might gobble up this name for quite some time. It's interesting to me that they call out Uber as a potential buyer here, just because we just saw Uber kind of dis-- I almost said disinflating, I'm on the Fed chats here-- disembarking from its partnership with Drizly yesterday, maybe perhaps giving themselves a little bit more flexibility on the balance sheet to look into other investments like an Instacart."", ""But, Josh, we know this, analysts like Uber because they have the capital to invest in other growth areas. And Instacart, I don't know about you, but in my home, it's certainly a growth area."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Is it really? No, we were big Instacart during the pandemic for sure, like, by the way, a lot of people.', ""MADISON MILLS: And you're saying now I'm lazy?"", 'JOSH LIPTON: Now, not as much. No, not at all, I would never make-- I would never make that kind of call, Madison, at least not on air. This is an interesting note. They go to outperform, sort of buy. Their price target is 35. And one reason is they do see this potential merger. You might ask yourself, why would Instacart be interested in that?', ""At least at Wolfe, their argument is, listen, if you're Instacart, you know you've got competition, plenty of it, and it's increasing from Dash and Amazon and Uber. So I guess the idea is why not join forces. Why it might not happen, though, there's different reasons for that. The Wolfe team pointing out plenty of risks, the kind of M&A is generally bring to the mobility space, including, as you mentioned, the fact that Uber just announced plans to shut down Drizly after acquiring it in 2021. But great note, interesting thesis, for sure.""]"

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. Basically the company is earning less on its investments and it is also reducing its total assets. And from a first read, things don't look too good at Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), so let's see why."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Qorvo:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.0056 = US$34m ÷ (US$6.7b - US$672m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Qorvo has an ROCE of 0.6%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Semiconductor industry average of 11%."", ' View our latest analysis for Qorvo ', ""In the above chart we have measured Qorvo's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Qorvo. To be more specific, the ROCE was 3.4% five years ago, but since then it has dropped noticeably. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Qorvo becoming one if things continue as they have."", ""In summary, it's unfortunate that Qorvo is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. However the stock has delivered a 58% return to shareholders over the last five years, so investors might be expecting the trends to turn around. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere."", ""While Qorvo doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation  on our platform."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Reported EPS is $0.99 EPS, expectations were $0.99. U.S. Bancorp\xa0isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Hello, and welcome to the U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 8 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.', ""George Andersen: Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Cecere; our Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, Terry Dolan; and our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Stern. With their prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, our earnings release, our Form 10-K and its subsequent reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission."", 'Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy.', ""Andy Cecere: Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.49, which included $0.50 per share of notable items that John will discuss in more detail. Excluding these notable items, earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, net revenue totaled $6.9 billion, and for the full year, we generated record net revenue of $28.3 billion. We demonstrated strength across our fee businesses, which helped to offset pressure on net interest income. Turning to Slide 4. Total loans were lower on a linked-quarter basis by 1.1%, reflecting slower demand, particularly in corporate lending and continued focus on lending opportunities that meet our return hurdles."", 'Average deposits declined compared with the third quarter as our strong funding position allowed us to be more disciplined on deposit pricing while maintaining our liquidity profile. Credit quality continued to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels this quarter, and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding $49 million to our loan loss reserve. As of December 31, tangible book value per share increased 14.7% from a year ago, and our common equity tier 1 capital ratio ended the year at 9.9%, an increase of 20 basis points this quarter. This ratio is 150 basis points higher than when we completed the acquisition of Union Bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. Supported by a strong capital accretion this year, the Board approved an increase to our quarterly common dividend in December to $0.49 per common share.', 'Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On an adjusted basis, we delivered 19.6% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter and 21.7% return on tangible common equity for the full year. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.', 'John Stern: Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 6, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter, or $0.99 per share after adjusting for notable items. Notable items totaled $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis or $780 million net of tax, representing a $0.50 reduction per diluted common share, including an FDIC special assessment charge of $734 million, offset by a benefit from tax settlements in the quarter. Other notable items this quarter included, merger and integration costs of $171 million, a charitable contribution to fund our community benefits plan of $110 million, and a balance sheet optimization charge of $118 million. This quarter, we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment securities portfolio, which we expect will enhance our net interest income trajectory, while also strengthening our capital and liquidity positioning.', 'Slide 7 provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter. Turning to Slide 8, we continue to manage the balance sheet prudently as we saw reduced loan demand this quarter and the competition for deposits remained heightened as system-wide liquidity declined. Total assets ended the year at $663 billion. Average loans declined 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis, as growth in credit card loans supported by consumer spending and low payment rates was more than offset by weaker commercial loan demand. Average deposits declined 1.9% linked quarter. Given our strong deposit balances in the third quarter, we moderated our deposit pricing somewhat in the fourth quarter even as we grew consumer deposits by 1%. During the quarter, we rebalanced a portion of our securities portfolio, which provided risk-weighted asset relief and improved our overall earnings trajectory.', 'The average yield on total investment securities portfolio increased to 2.97% for the fourth quarter, a 55 basis point increase compared to a year earlier. As of December 31, the ending balance on the total investment securities portfolio was $161 billion. During the quarter, effective duration on the available for sale portfolio declined to less than three years as unrealized losses, net of tax, improved by approximately $2 billion given the movement in rates and repositioning. Turning to Slide 9, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined 3.0% linked quarter, driven by a modest decline in the net interest margin of 2.78%. The 3 basis point decline in the net interest margin reflected market dynamics including deposit pricing pressure and unfavorable shifts in the deposit mix, partially offset by better earning asset spreads and improved total funding mix.', 'In the first quarter of 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. For the full year 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter 2023 net interest income level of approximately $4.14 billion to up slightly. Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income, as adjusted, increased 12.1% on a year-over-year basis, driven by new account growth and deepening relationships across the business. Year-over-year payment service revenue benefited by continued strength in consumer and business spending activities, while increases in trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenue were driven by underlying market activity, a full fourth quarter with Union Bank, and core growth.', 'Turning to Slide 11, noninterest expenses, as adjusted, decreased by 1.0% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by lower compensation-related expense that was partially offset by strategic investments in marketing and business development. Slide 12 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics trended in-line with expectations, and key metrics continue to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.40% at December 31 compared with 0.35% at September 30 and 0.26% a year ago. The fourth quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.49% increased 5 basis points from a third quarter level of 0.44% and was higher when compared to a fourth quarter 2022 level of 0.23%, as adjusted.', 'Turning to Slide 13, we increased our common equity tier 1 ratio to 9.9% as of December 31. The combination of earnings accretion, net of distributions, and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a 20 basis point increase linked quarter. Balance sheet optimization activities continue to have a low to neutral impact on earnings and provided additional risk transfer benefits. As we move into 2024, we expect earnings to be the primary driver of capital accretion with limited reliance on balance sheet capital-related actions. As of December 31, 2023, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio remains above our regulatory capital minimum by 290 basis points. Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.', ""Andy Cecere: Thanks, John. I'll end my prepared comments on Slide 14. 2023 was a turbulent year for the industry. However, we achieved a great deal, including our successful conversion of Union Bank in late May and the realization of $900 million in run rate cost synergies related to Union Bank by year-end as we had targeted. Additionally, we accomplished our goal of accreting -- accelerating the accretion of CET1 capital and received full relief from Category II commitments we made in conjunction with the Union Bank transaction. Entering 2024, we are positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns on tangible common equity, are appropriately reserved for macroeconomic uncertainties and remain confident in our strategy for future growth and expansion."", ""We are seeing positive momentum across our fee-based businesses as we deepen our most profitable client relationships and continue to target flat expense growth in 2024 even as we strategically invest in key areas and further execute on revenue growth opportunities with Union Bank. Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities, and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company. We'll now open up the call for Q&A."", 'See also Best Real Estate Lawyers in Each of the 30 Biggest Cities in the US and 15 States With the Highest Income Taxes in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

However, we achieved a great deal, including our successful conversion of Union Bank in late May and the realization of $900 million in run rate cost synergies related to Union Bank by year-end as we had targeted. Additionally, we accomplished our goal of accreting the -- accelerating the accretion of CET1 capital and received full relief from category 2 commitments we made in conjunction with the Union Bank transaction. Entering 2024, we are positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns on tangible common equity, are appropriately reserved for macroeconomic uncertainties and remain confident in our strategy for future growth and expansion. We are seeing positive momentum across our fee-based businesses as we deepen our most profitable client relationships and continue to target flat expense growth in 2024, even as we strategically invest in key areas and further execute on revenue growth opportunities with Union Bank. Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company. We'll now open up the call for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.', 'Robert Scott Siefers', ""I was hoping you could maybe provide a little more context around the NII thoughts for the full year. It sounds like if I did the math correctly, we're expecting somewhere between $16.5 billion and $16.6 billion for the full year. Maybe just some thoughts on how the margin and NII should traject. I would presume maybe a little more downward pressure on NII given day count in the first quarter, but does it trough there and then sort of grow throughout the year? Or would there be other factors that would cause NII maybe to bleed through, say, middle of the year and then start to inflect back up? Or maybe just any thoughts there."", 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. Just -- maybe to just reiterate what was mentioned. In the first quarter, we'll see net interest income between $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion. As we think about the full year for 2024, it's going to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter number 2023 level of $4.14 billion and -- to up slightly. And we're using the fourth quarter actuals really because that -- we feel that that's a more appropriate starting point given our balance sheet is now past all the capital actions that took place during the 2023 calendar year. And so some of the color around that and some of the drivers related to how we are thinking about that is, we do believe that DDA and low-cost deposit churn into higher-cost deposits are going to abate over time. By the end of this quarter, we'll be 9 months past the last Fed hike, as an example. We continue to see loan spreads improve in various categories, led on the commercial side of things. Loan and investment portfolio, asset churn continues to occur. Our loan pipelines have continued to strengthen over this quarter, certainly stronger than we've seen in the past couple of quarters. And we think that loan demand should be improved just given that the Fed is likely going to be in a cutting mode over time. And the counter to that, of course, is that deposit pricing is going to be competitive, especially with QT running in some form in the background. So while I'll say that first quarter NII projection is going to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter, these broad factors are really going to be supportive of NII growth as we -- especially as we think about the second half of the year."", 'Robert Scott Siefers', 'Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just a quick question on capital. Glad to hear that some of those balance sheet optimization efforts are beginning to sunset. Maybe, one, do you have what you all estimate the sort of fully loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio to be now? And maybe the balance between just building and potentially returning capital going forward.', 'John C. Stern', ""Scott. So I mean, right now, as you know, we're at 9.9% on CET1 with the improvement in rates, the impact of the AOCI on the investment portfolio, securities is about 2.2 percentage points, and so you're at 7.7%. As we think about it on a fully loaded basis. So if you think about it on a go-forward basis, we're going to create capital in the area of 20 to 25 basis points per quarter. We will have a burn-down on the securities book of about 30% or so relative to where it is by the end of '25, just to give you some context. So all that kind of adds up to building our capital to where we think it needs to be for the appropriate time, given regulation and the timing of that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""Just maybe, John, following up on the NII question. One, sorry if I missed it, what rate cut did -- assumptions did you have in your NII outlook? And then just talk to us about sensitivity. Are 3 cuts worse than 6 cuts? Just how we should -- given market expectations around this probably is going to change week by week, I'm just trying to test the resiliency of your NII outlook if they get more or less rate cuts."", 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. Absolutely. So in terms of our current projections, we have 4 interest rate cuts by the Fed starting in the second quarter of this year. Now whether or not that's 2 cuts or 6 cuts, it's not going to be a material driver to our outlook. We have worked hard to get our net interest income sensitivity to be more or less in a neutral position. And so we feel like whether the cuts are -- how they are positioned are not going to be a material driver to the change -- of the outlook, excuse me."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""That's helpful. And I guess just a second question. I'm not sure if you laid out any outlook for fee revenue growth for the year in terms of -- if you can just talk to in terms of what you expect overall in fee revenues. And particularly on payments, if you can call out expectations on what you assume for the year there."", 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. Yes, I'll call out a couple of things on payments and some of the other fee categories. So as we think about payments, certainly, in terms of merchant processing, we've put a lot of investment in there. There's a lot of technology-led advancements that we've made in terms of connections and certainly some MUB synergies. And so we continue to expect high single digits in terms of revenue growth there. The same would be said for corporate payments. We think high single digits, given the amount of T&E growth and client growth and all that sort of thing that we see. And then on the card side of things, we've seen a very nice margin expansion. MUB certainly helps, and holiday sales have been -- were certainly helpful this past quarter, but we see that extending, and so we think mid-single digits from that standpoint. I would also reiterate, we've had really very nice growth in the commercial product side. We've had -- particularly in 2023, we would expect high single digits there, given strength we've had in foreign exchange, derivatives, the fixed income, capital markets, loan syndication has all been performing very well for us. Our trust and investment management fee also should experience growth, led by our institutional service businesses and corporate trust and fund services and certainly in wealth management, some of the fees associated with that. The one thing I would point out, though, in terms of service charges. We've exited our ATM cash servicing business, and that was a business we decided to exit just given the high level of capital related to it in terms of intensity and investment. And so that will impact us by about $30 million to $35 million per quarter starting in the first quarter."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', 'Thanks for the color so far on the guidance. I guess similarly, can you walk through your -- within the NII expectations you provided, can you walk through your expectation for loan growth for the year and how you expect that could traject? I know you cited demand weakening. And then the same thing on the deposit front. If you can maybe give us your expectation of how you think growth can look like on an overall basis and maybe how the net interest -- I mean the noninterest-bearing mix could traject from here.', 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. So a couple of things there. So I'll start on the loan growth side. I do believe our expectation is that we will see growth in the commercial side. Of course, that was a little bit weaker this last quarter as we experienced paydowns, particularly as clients were accessing capital markets and things of that nature. But we've seen really a good pipeline build on that. We expect utilization to pick up and things of that variety. So we feel like that, along with credit cards, will be good sources of growth for us as we think about loan growth going forward. On the deposit side, as a reminder, we'll probably be lower in the first quarter. We seasonally lose deposits just as we kind of go through the year-end process. And just given the mix of our businesses, deposits end up being a little bit lower in the first quarter. But then we see more or less stabilization. But there might be some headwind there, particularly depending on QT and how the Fed draining of liquidity out of the system will impact the numbers there. And then going into your NIB comment, we've seen, of course, rotation out of NIB into other interest-bearing products. That continues, but starts to wane as we go throughout the year. And again as I mentioned, we're going to be 9 months, by the end of this quarter, past the last Fed hike, and that gives us some signal that, that will begin to abate."", 'John G. Pancari', ""Okay. And then I guess if you could help us just think about how we should think about the magnitude of operating leverage that's reasonable as you look at next year. I know we do have some color on how you're thinking about NII and fees and then put that against your efforts to keep expenses stable. But I guess, could you just maybe frame it, a range of operating leverage that you think is reasonable as we look at next year?"", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""John, this is Andy. So let me start with this, and John can add on. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to benefit from the cost efficiencies of the Union deal to a total of $900 million, and that is fully reflected now and into the run rate starting this quarter. So we're achieving those benefits because of the benefits of technology, investments we've made, digital investments, operational investments, our risk platform. And so that is the benefit of the investments we've made, and we would expect to continue to invest in the business, in those capabilities in payments and technology modernization. So we are also very cognizant in managing expenses very closely. We still have opportunities in terms of efficiencies in personnel, in operations and activities around technology that will allow us to more efficiently deliver the services we have. So I would expect, as we get towards the second half of the year, that when we start to see that margin growth that John talked about as well as the fee normalization, that we would have opportunity for positive operating leverage. And we're going to -- again, that is our long-term objective, as always, and we have levers to pull."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.', 'John Eamon McDonald', 'I was wondering if you could give a little color on what you saw this quarter in credit quality on the NPA movement, particularly in commercial. And then also, John, maybe just some thoughts on the potential charge-off trajectory as you see things migrate from NPA into charge-offs this year, what we should be thinking about?', 'Terrance Robert Dolan', ""John, this is Terry Dolan. So I'm going to take this question related to credit quality. Your first one was really related to nonperforming assets and some of the things we saw in the fourth quarter. If you end up going across the portfolio, generally pretty stable. We did see a couple of idiosyncratic loans that went into nonperforming status. Both of those were kind of Union legacy sort of credits, so continue to kind of work through that. But I would also say that both of those are fairly well collateralized, so we don't necessarily see a lot of charge-off content related to those idiosyncratic credits. When we look at net charge-offs and the trajectory, I would expect that -- or we would expect that it will continue to kind of normalize. Credit card is kind of getting closer to pre-pandemic levels, but that will continue to move up a little bit. Our expectation is that, for full year 2024, we'll probably be in kind of in the mid-50s in terms of the net charge-off rate."", 'John Eamon McDonald', ""Okay. And then, John or Andy, just on the fee revenues. John ticked off on the fee revenues a number of high single-digit kind of potential growers in '24. How do we think about kind of the ability to grow total fee revenues? And what kind of base should we use for that? It looks like maybe the adjusted base for '23 was about $10.8 billion of fee revenues. Is that something you can grow off of that? Just trying to contextualize. Total revenue last year was around $28 billion. How should we think about the ability to grow revenues on fees and maybe total revenues this year?"", 'John C. Stern', 'Yes. So I mean, we had -- as you mentioned, some of the fee numbers there. From a core fee perspective, we do expect to grow. I ticked off some of the areas in terms of payments, commercial products, trust and all that sort of thing. Other -- and some of the service charges components there. Of course, in terms of mortgage, that will be probably somewhat on the flat range. And in terms of other, we had a little bit of a high number in terms of the fourth quarter related to tax credit related impact, finance, syndication fees and things like that. So all those things in, we expect kind of that mid-single in terms of the fee components going forward for this year.', 'John Eamon McDonald', 'Okay. Kind of a mid-single from that $10.8 billion adjusted base.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS.', 'Erika Najarian', ""My first question is for you, Andy. Clearly, you went through it in terms of some capital consternation in 2023. And now you're sitting here with 9.9% CET1. No longer have to be a category 2 bank early. And all the color that we're getting from Washington is that Basel III end game will be at least delayed, if not soften significantly. As you think about maybe just one more hurdle ahead over the near term in terms of the DFAST, how are you thinking about where USB's proper CET1 ratio is in terms of the minimum? Looking forward to a future where maybe capital is a little bit tighter, but you're also growing. And do you feel like you're now on offense, and all the sort of the balance sheet management that was designed to optimize capital is fully behind you?"", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""Yes, Erika. As John mentioned, I think our balance sheet optimization efforts are behind us. Our focus on capital accretion will be from earnings as we go into 2024 and forward. As we talked about, we are at a 9.9% CET1 ratio today. A couple of years ago, our target was between 8.5% and 9%. So we're above that target. But we're also cognizant of the rules that are coming, both from the perspective of Basel III end game, which is still uncertain, as you talked about, as well as CCAR and how that will evolve over time. So we will continue to accrete the 20% to 25%. We'll continue to burn down the AOCI. When we get clarity on the capital rules, both Basel III and CCAR, we'll then determine what the proper capital target will be. My expectation is we'll be above the 9% that we were a few years ago. But we'll define that, refine that, and then we'll get into what the math is around buybacks at that time."", 'Erika Najarian', ""Got it. And one follow-up question for you, John. Thank you for giving us some of the components of the NII. I'm just wondering, as you mentioned QT, are you generally expecting deposits to be down, total deposits to be down even if DDA mix shift abates? And also, how quickly do you think the deposit betas on the way down can react to each Fed rate cut?"", 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. So the first part of your question in terms of QT. We do anticipate QT to be throughout the year. And so that's going to, on whole, put pressure on deposits throughout the year in terms of balances. And so we don't expect a lot of growth overall in deposits, but we'll -- we have ways to manage through that. Of course, they're talking through various ways to change the QT, but that just remains to be seen. In terms of deposits performance on the way down, I would anticipate commercial and wholesale type balances will go down just as fast as they would come up. On the retail side, it's going to be more of an arc. It'll take some time for that to turn. But those are our expectations."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.', 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""So I wasn't clear. Are you guiding for flat, positive or negative operating leverage or none of the above for 2024? And more generally, I mean, the real question is, when do you get back to your historical efficiency ratio? I think you talked about this at a presentation in December. I mean, 61% core efficiency in the fourth quarter isn't exactly like legacy U.S. Bancorp, and that's up 300 basis points year-over-year. And earlier last decade, you were 55%. Going back further, you were in the low 50s. Is that just a aspirational target now? Or is that a real target over the next 2 years or so? And along those lines, I guess, you have all the savings you're going to get from Union Bank. So where does the risk come from here?"", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""Yes, Mike, it's probably more likely a positive operating leverage in the second half of '24 versus the first half given some of the margin pressures that we talked about. That is still our objective. My expectation is, once we get more to our normalized revenue level, that we will continue to manage expenses below revenue growth and continue to take down that efficiency ratios into the 50s. That's the way we're planning."", 'Michael Lawrence Mayo', ""When you say into the 50s, I mean, is it something -- can you get back to 55%? Is that in your planning horizon, even going out a few more years? And it looks like the payments business is recatching its stride here. And along those lines, I didn't see the slide anymore on the payments business combined with small business banking. You're going to grow small business relationship like 15% to 20% and the revenues by 25% to 30%. I don't see any slide for that. And I know you got -- look, you got Union Bank deal, you had the issues of last March and April. And it's okay, your capital is back, the deal is done, and now we're back to kind of U.S. Bancorp business as usual. So I'm just trying to look for some color on that, if you're going to become the Square of banking or if that's still a goal, and how those revenues might help you improve that efficiency."", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""Sure, Mike. And it is still a goal. We do think this combination of payments and business banking and providing that comprehensive product set and capabilities to help people run their business is a key strategic priority. It continues to be. And I think the fee categories that John mentioned are also a key driver of revenue, including payments, commercial products, trust and investment. And those are all areas that we expect continued growth on. The immediate pressure on net interest income is what's causing us not to get positive operating leverage in the short term. But it is something that I believe, and as John mentioned, will abate and start to grow into the second half of 2024. And so I think we're going to get to the positive operating leverage. We are planning on it. And we will continue to drive that efficiency ratio down certainly into the 50 -- high 50s at the beginning and continue to deliver positive operating leverage to get it even lower. That's our objective."", 'Operator', ""Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""Just to clarify, the flat expense guidance for '24 is also the adjusted level of '23 of 17.0?"", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""That's correct."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", 'Okay. And I assume that includes any expense benefit from the exit of the ATM cash business that you referenced earlier?', 'Andrew J. Cecere', 'Correct.', ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""Okay. And then just stepping back, like any other kind of small businesses or segments that you're kind of reevaluating for? Not so much kind of the regulatory proposals, which we'll see how they may finalize, but just other areas that you're stepping back. And whether it's in mortgage, given the smaller market there, or other parts of the business portfolio that you're looking either to exit or to potentially lean into that's a bit different than you were thinking, say, 6 months ago."", 'John C. Stern', ""Well, I can start and Andy can chime in. I think we commented on the ATM business. I mean, you're constantly evaluating certain things, particularly in the light of regulatory change. Clearly, a lot of comment letters have been submitted in terms of the Basel III end game. At the end of the day, it's not going to materially drive, whether we exit businesses or enter new businesses, that sort of thing. It's just going to be a combination of a continual investment, as Andy mentioned, in terms of what we need to do toward achieving positive operating leverage and managing around regulatory actions. Those are some of the comments I'd throw out there."", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""Yes. I think I agree, John. And the only thing I'd add is that the environment and the competitive dynamic is something that causes us to be more aggressive or less aggressive in certain categories. And maybe the example I'll give you is auto lending, which is -- for us is not growing right now. And that's because of the spreads and the returns are just not at our levels that we want to put on the books. So those are areas that we're going to not get out of or close down, but just not emphasize in terms of growth at the levels of returns that we're seeing right now."", ""Matthew Derek O'Connor"", ""Okay. And then specifically in credit card, we're obviously seeing a normalization of losses with you guys and throughout the industry, and also very strong growth. So if we adjust losses kind of on a lag basis, they are above a few years ago. At what point do you tighten up credit card and say we should slow growth at this point in the cycle? Or do you think there's still quite a bit of runway of, call it, good growth and healthy growth?"", 'Terrance Robert Dolan', ""Yes. Well, I mean, it is an area, Matt, that we think that there continues to be a nice growth in that particular space. It is an area, though, that certainly as we have looked at the economic uncertainties and those all sorts of things, the pressure on consumers, especially given the inflationary sort of pressure, we -- on the margin around the edges, we do make adjustments to underwriting and tighten that up where we need to. But when you end up kind of thinking about the overall credit performance of credit card business, we still think it's a very nice business. We focus on prime, super prime sort of customers. And even through this cycle, I think it's going to perform very well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', 'John, you touched on, in answering your question, about commercial loan growth, that some of your customers were accessing in capital markets and things of that nature. Can you guys share with us, we read a lot and see a lot about the private credit markets have really become quite active and aggressive in making loans to corporate and commercial customers. Are you guys seeing that competition, number one? And also, is it any different than past years? Or has it intensified? And then simultaneously, are any of these private, Apollo, Blackstone, et cetera, are these customers of yours? And if they are, how do you balance the competition versus handling their needs?', 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. This is John, Gerard. In terms of on the commercial side, when I commented that going to the capital markets, it's more or less the public market, so taking bond issuance in the public investment-grade market. .We tend not to see them or compete on the private credit side of things. It's just not a structure or type of loan type in terms of our client base that we tend to run into. So it's more or less -- I can't say it's increased or decreased versus because we just don't see those names. We compete in the commercial space with our peer banks more or less in that particular venue. In terms of -- you mentioned in terms of client interaction, we have great relationships with a number of different names in terms of investment services, capital markets activities, other sorts of categories. So we do have some very nice relationships with those institutions."", 'Andrew J. Cecere', 'Yes. Our corporate trust and global fund services, Gerard, as John mentioned, businesses, they support a number of large private credit funds in the industry and -- where they are customers and clients of ours that we continue to serve.', 'Terrance Robert Dolan', ""I think the last thing I would just add is that, depending upon where the capital rules end up and what sort of -- where the emphasis is or isn't, you could see more or less moving into the private capital sort of markets. They tend to have more flexibility in terms of structure. They take on more risk, all those sorts of things. Again, may not be where we compete. But certainly, from an industry standpoint, private credit continues to be an area of focus."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Just if we step back for a moment and look at beyond Basel III end game, maybe we do get the final proposal in the middle of this year or later this year. We get through the next DFAST. U.S. Bancorp has always had a hallmark of having one of the highest ROTCEs amongst the regional banks. Obviously, you're probably going to maintain that. But you also were very disciplined in giving back the excess capital every year to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. Generally, if I recall correctly, around 75% to 80% of total earnings in a combination of both. Andy, do you see that coming on the horizon? Maybe 2025, once we get all the rules, that we know where your CET1 ratio needs to be, what's your outlook there?"", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""Yes, Gerard, we do achieve a high return on tangible common. I mentioned 19% to 20% fourth quarter, first -- full year '24. And as we think about going forward, I would expect us to continue to lead the pack in terms of that return, which is key to generating capital, key to returning capital. And again, once we get clarity on the rules, as I mentioned earlier, in both the Basel III end game as well as the CCAR process, and determine our target capital levels, we will return the difference either through dividends or buybacks, as been our history."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.', 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', 'A follow-up on the deposit side. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about starting to moderate pricing a little bit, and you also talked about roll-off of higher-cost deposits. Just wondering if you can amplify both of those comments. So what types of products or tweaks are you already being able to make on the deposit pricing front? And then where did those higher-cost deposits flow out of from a business perspective?', 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. Thanks, Ken. Mike, the comment was really around in terms of the fourth quarter in just what we saw. Maybe just stepping back a bit. In the third quarter, we grew deposits quite a bit. And part of that was we were just getting through the Union Bank acquisition. We wanted to make sure we were maintaining strong relationships with those clients, and really all clients, as we're going through those times. In the fourth quarter, given where loan demand went and where we had a little bit of excess deposits, so we've made decisions really just tactically to go away from non-deposit -- non-relationship or less relationship-based, and specifically on time deposits declining and things of that nature. So I think that's just going to be the ebb and flow of things of just how we manage it going forward, depending on loan growth, depending on our profile and depending on the relationship. So that's really what that comment was intended for."", 'Andrew J. Cecere', 'And importantly, John, on our core consumer deposits, we are continuing to see growth there, as you mentioned, as we had in the slide.', 'John C. Stern', ""Yes. We continue to expect core deposit growth in the consumer side. And that has been something we've been -- the team has been very focused on, and we feel we've had great success there."", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Got it. And as a follow-up to the UB point, is everything from UB now fully baked, whether it's the cost actions and structure? And also that's kind of making sure you're buttoned up as a starting point, have that base of loans and deposits gotten to a steady state as well?"", 'John C. Stern', 'Yes.', 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', 'Okay. So we just move forward with everything and listen to the guide comments that you gave earlier.', 'John C. Stern', ""Exactly. It's all in the core now, yes."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC.', 'Saul Martinez', ""Maybe on the payment side, if you just add a little bit more detail about how you're feeling about your payment strategy, how you're doing and how much -- how big the upside opportunity is there. Obviously, you're growing nicely on the issuing side, the merchant acquiring side, sort of mid-single-digit growth in revenues and volumes. I think you said high single digit next year. I mean, as you guys know, the banks have ceded a lot of share to software companies, to integrated service providers. And just how do you feel it's going in terms of integrating your commercial banking and payments offering? And it does seem like you have a major advantage in terms of having relationships, both on the retail and commercial side. And then, obviously, you kind of have that 2-sided network that a lot of the fintechs want. But obviously, banks have struggled in this area. So just maybe if you could just give us sort of an overview of how you're doing and how you feel the opportunity set is evolving."", 'Andrew J. Cecere', ""Yes, Saul. So first of all, the high single digits on merchant processing is a function of the investments we've made and the initiatives we have underway. And I would highlight 2 things. Number one is our tech led initiative, which is now up, over 30% of our activities related to tech-led. So that is integrating our merchant processing capabilities into the software that people use to run their businesses. And number two is this whole integration of banking and payments that we talked about earlier. And the advantage I do believe that we have is that we are not just providing one single service. We're integrating banking services, deposit, lending capabilities, treasury management, together with payments and money movement into one comprehensive offering that helps people, again, run their business, particularly small businesses, and helps them ease into the process of payment activity in a comprehensive way together with the software they're using to run their company. So those are the initiatives that we have underway, and that continues to be a huge focus and one that I do think differentiates us a little bit because of the capabilities we have in payments. And that's true of merchant processing, corporate payments as well as retail issuing."", 'Saul Martinez', ""Okay. Got it. No, that's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on deposits. You mentioned the migration, you expect the migration out of noninterest-bearing deposits to sort of run its course. Just when and where do you see that? I think noninterest-bearing was about 17.5% of total deposits. How much more room is there? And just on deposit cost, I think the cumulative beta, if my calculation's right, is around 49%. How much more room is there for that to increase? Sort of what's embedded in your guidance for NII?"", 'John C. Stern', ""Sure. So in terms of the NIB, I think we've talked quite a bit about it. I would just -- I mean, we're at a certain percentage that you mentioned, and we're going to be around that area. Certainly could drift a little lower. But we are at a point where, from a core standpoint, particularly on the commercial and small business side, where you're starting to get into places where companies have to run operating accounts. And over time, you're going to have account growth and things of that variety. So I think that will be conducive to supporting NIB going forward.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $2.99 billion, up 7.2% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.23% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Raymond James Financial, Inc.', ""For Raymond James Financial, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.55%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Raymond James Financial, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Raymond James Financial, Inc. Would post earnings of $2.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.13, delivering a surprise of -6.58%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Raymond James Financial, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Palo Alto will be integrating Talon into its Prisma Cloud platform, allowing organizations to provide security and data protection to all their employees, even if they are using unmanaged devices.', 'Palo Alto points out that ""integrating Talon with Prisma Access can provide customers with substantial productivity benefits by enabling unmanaged devices, but also ensures consistent security and deeper visibility into device usage, all while preserving user privacy.""', 'The company made this acquisition to bolster its Prisma SASE (secure access service edge) platform, aiming to give customers a single, comprehensive platform to secure all web applications and devices their employees use. This is a smart move considering that the SASE market grew an impressive 35% in 2023 to $9 billion, according to Gartner.', ""SASE adoption is expected to remain strong thanks to the growing adoption of cloud solutions by businesses, creating the need for organizations to secure all the devices and applications on their networks. Gartner expects the SASE market's revenue to increase at an annual rate of more than 30% through 2027. This suggests that the SASE market could clock almost $26 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, and Palo Alto's strategy of strengthening its platform with a new acquisition should help it corner a bigger chunk of that market."", ""Talon, however, is not the only acquisition Palo Alto has made of late to bolster the Prisma Cloud security platform. The company completed the acquisition of another Israeli cybersecurity firm, Dig Security, last month in a deal that's reportedly worth $400 million. This acquisition should allow Palo Alto to cut its teeth in the data security posture management (DSPM) space, which is witnessing solid adoption by customers."", 'DSPM allows an organization to track its assets across multiple cloud environments and enables the cybersecurity team to protect them in case there is a breach. Gartner forecasts that more than 20% of companies will be using DSPM by 2026.', 'These two recent moves by Palo Alto Networks to secure its cloud security platform are smart considering that the cloud security space is expected to grow by 25% in 2024 to $7 billion, outpacing the growth of the overall cybersecurity market. According to another estimate, the global cloud security market could clock annual growth of 22% through 2032, so Palo Alto is doing the right thing by shoring up its position in this space.', 'Palo Alto released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results (for the three months ended Oct. 31, 2023) in November 2023. The company is anticipating full-year revenue to increase 18% to 19%, to between $8.15 billion and $8.20 billion. Its adjusted earnings are expected to land at $5.47 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range, translating to 23% growth over the prior year.', 'However, the recent acquisitions suggest that it could finish the year with stronger growth. It is also worth noting that Palo Alto was sitting on remaining performance obligations (RPO) worth $10.4 billion at the end of the previous quarter, an increase of 26% over the prior year.', ""This metric refers to the total value of contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, which means that it points toward a robust future revenue pipeline. The faster growth in Palo Alto's RPO as compared to its actual revenue growth indicates that the company has landed more contracts that should help it ensure solid growth over the long run."", ""As the following chart indicates, Palo Alto is anticipated to maintain healthy revenue growth rates over the next couple of years, though don't be surprised to see the company's growth outpacing consensus estimates given that it is bolstering its position in lucrative niches."", ""Consensus estimates are forecasting Palo Alto's earnings to increase at an annual rate of almost 23% for the next five years. Based on its fiscal 2024 earnings forecast of $5.47 per share, its bottom line could jump to $15.40 per share in fiscal 2029. Palo Alto has a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 47. Assuming it trades at a discounted forward earnings multiple of 40 after five years, which would be lower than its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 52, its stock price could conceivably jump to $616 based on the projected earnings in fiscal 2029."", 'That would be a 90% jump from current levels, which is why investors looking to buy a cybersecurity stock right now should consider Palo Alto Networks.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palo Alto Networks wasn't one of them.

But Microsoft’s search engine ended 2023 with just 3.4% of the global search market, according to data analytics firm StatCounter, up less than 1 percentage point since the ChatGPT announcement.', 'Bing has long struggled for relevance and attracted more mockery than recognition over the years as a serious alternative to Google. Multiple rebrandings and redesigns since its 2009 debut did little to boost Bing’s popularity. A month before Microsoft infused the search engine with generative AI, people were spending 33% less time using it than they had 12 months earlier, according to SensorTower.', 'The ChatGPT reboot at least helped reverse those declines. In the second quarter of 2023, US monthly active users more than doubled year over year to 3.1 million, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of SensorTower mobile app data. Overall, users were spending 84% more time on the search engine, the data show. By year-end, Bing’s monthly active users had increased steadily to 4.4 million, according to SensorTower.', 'To build on the momentum, Microsoft has been adding more AI tools to Bing. In October, the company integrated the latest version of OpenAI’s image-generating model, DALL-E 3. Visitors can use it to create realistic-looking images with simple text prompts.', 'The offering does nothing to enhance Bing’s search abilities. But its addition generated a spike in usage, according to Jordi Ribas, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of search and AI.', '“We noticed an increase in usage by 10 times and that took us by surprise because if you think about it, DALL-E 2 was already quite good,” he said in an interview. “It really made a difference in the engagement and the users that came to our product.”', 'Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s consumer chief marketing officer, declined to specify how many active users Bing has.', '“Look, it’s still early days and new behaviors are being built,” he said. “We’re still learning new things, but have millions and millions of people using the new tools.”', 'Even as the Bing team adds crowd-pleasers, Google has been racing to develop its own AI tools. In May, it launched an experimental version of its search engine called the “search generative experience,” which delivers conversational responses atop the familiar list of links. Dubbed SGE for short, it’s still not widely available. However, Google plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into SGE sometime this year.', 'The Alphabet Inc. division also retains considerable advantages. It has more than 90% of the market and is the default search engine on Apple Inc. hardware, including iPhones, giving Google crucial critical mass. The more people who use it, the more the search engine knows and the more Google can use that data to deliver and rank results in a way people find useful.', 'The retooling of search by both technology giants reflects a shared conviction that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people seek and receive answers online. For Microsoft, the shift is an opportunity to propel Bing forward. But the incremental gains so far make clear that buzzy AI features alone probably won’t transform it into a formidable search player.', '“We are at the gold rush moment when it comes to AI and search,” said Shane Greenstein, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, who has studied the commercialization of the internet. “At the moment, I doubt AI will move the needle because, in search, you need a flywheel: the more searches you have, the better answers are. Google is the only firm who has this dynamic well-established.”', 'Still, Greenstein said Bing, being the underdog, has more latitude to experiment. “Google has to be careful not to hurt its brand and product when it comes to testing new AI tools,” he said. “Bing can afford to take the risk. It has nothing to lose.”', 'Microsoft is also betting that generative AI will change how advertisers allocate their search spending. The current ad model rests on costs-per-click, but AI-powered searches are getting consumers to answers faster and more directly without a litany of blue links, according to marketing chief Mehdi.', '“We have advertisers telling us they’re getting better outcomes as a result of our AI efforts and are deeply interested in how this works,” he said.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'How Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine', 'The Downfall of Diddy Inc.', 'Should I Tell My Colleagues (or My Boss) About My Bipolar Diagnosis?', 'It’s the Tesla Earnings Call—Time for Elon Musk Bingo', 'The Bitcoin Hype Is Back and About Just as Hollow as Before', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

These are enterprises that didn’t quite pass muster last year. However, with possibly shifting circumstances on the horizon, marching to a different beat may yield greater shareholder profitability.', 'Mathematically, by targeting beaten-down entities, you may be able to enjoy far more robust returns than the more conservative approach: betting on strong businesses in an uptrend hoping that the bulls continue to march forward. Of course, one issue with this framework is that if sentiment fades for whatever reason, you could be left holding the bag.', 'Still, deliberating targeting 2024 comeback stocks presents its own set of risks. Sometimes, many times, red ink leads to an even darker crimson stain.

Its core segment owns and operates 40 resorts across four countries. Further, its hospitality unit owns or manages various properties, including lodgings and golf courses. Finally, its development unit oversees property development and real estate holdings.', 'As you can guess, MTN depends heavily on consumer sentiment and that was a problem last year. With interest rates rising as policymakers struggled with stubbornly elevated inflation, the dollar effectively became more expensive. Thus, an incentive to hold onto greenbacks materialized. That’s not just a matter of opinion. Per the personal saving rate, the index rose conspicuously between November 2022 and November 2023.', 'However, with the Federal Reserve possibly poised to reduce interest rates this year, MTN might recover. After all, dollars may become cheapened, which may incentivize spending greenbacks. If so, MTN would probably rank among the stocks to recover in 2024.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'While the idea of betting on 2024 comeback stocks is risky, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) takes some of the edge off the underlying wager. Sure, it’s always risky to bet against prevailing trends. In this case, the oil and natural gas giant runs counter to the political and ideological push for green and sustainable energy. Nevertheless, XOM is relevant. Its high energy density may ensure that it stays relevant for a long time.', 'That’s not exactly what climate advocates may want to hear. However, we’re talking about scientific realities. Further, XOM makes arguably a great case for stocks to recover in 2024 due to geopolitics. Yes, it’s cynical, I won’t deny that. However, the major oil-producing nations tend to have poor relations with the U.S. and its western allies. With major producers apparently committed to production cuts, at some point, something must give.', 'I mean, we’re facing a possible situation of improving economic conditions, which will likely translate to resource consumption.

Therefore, XOM makes a case for stocks to recover in 2024.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational food processing and commodities firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes another great case for stocks to recover in 2024. Fundamentally, Archer Daniels is vital to the global food supply chain. Operating more than 270 plants and 420 crop procurement facilities worldwide, it’s one of the stalwarts in the food-production industry.', 'Of course, geopolitical flashpoints cloud the narrative when it comes to anything involving international supply chain flow.

Per Fintel, its short interest is 15.15% of its float while the short interest ratio comes in at 12.14 days to cover. Notably, short interest has been rising since mid-November last year.

If consumer sentiment rebounds this year, CCRD could be attractive. Per its website, CoreCard specializes in card issuing and processing platform services. Because of its specialty in handling these complex functions – including account setup, fraud detection, and rewards programs – the enterprise offers a relevant profile.', 'Why don’t credit card companies conduct their own processing services? It comes down to business efficiencies. Credit card issuers connect and facilitate transactions across their networks but they typically don’t directly manage issuing and processing for individual financial institutions. On the other hand, CoreCard provides services to such institutions to manage the “administrative” tasks on these established payment networks.', 'As discussed earlier, higher interest rates effectively made the dollar more expensive, resulting in a rise in personal savings. That’s not great for the payment services industry as a whole. However, if money becomes cheaper, spending might rise. That’s probably why CCRD could hit a projected target of $19.

While the company offers a gaming-like environment, the currencies used are virtual and cannot be cashed out.', 'That said, should the economic backdrop improve – that is, if the economy achieves a soft landing – PLTK could be interesting.

In turn, this dynamic could be beneficial to the gaming specialist.', 'For those looking for a speculative idea, PLTK’s short interest has been creeping higher.

Simply, it has a lower probability of success than the others.', 'Simultaneously, Tigo intrigues because of its core business. Per its public profile, the company specializes in providing products, technologies, software, and services to installers, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers within the photovoltaic industry. As you probably know, the broader solar energy space suffered a massive blow last year due in large part to rising borrowing costs.', 'However, that framework may be poised to shift favorably.

If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ', ""We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$1.77b', 'US$2.13b', 'US$2.20b', 'US$2.40b', 'US$2.59b', 'US$2.73b', 'US$2.85b', 'US$2.96b', 'US$3.06b', 'US$3.15b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 5.42%', 'Est @ 4.46%', 'Est @ 3.79%', 'Est @ 3.32%', 'Est @ 2.99%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$1.7k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.7k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Do keep this in mind.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Monster Beverage as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Though the job data report for December came in stronger than expected, it also cast doubt on the expectations of March rate cuts. The disappointing manufacturing data also added to the chaos. The U.S. manufacturing sector slipped further into contraction in December, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global, as output declined and the downturn in new orders gathered pace.Markets are pricing in a 71.4% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in March, compared with an 81% probability in the prior session, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.While the timing of interest rate cuts is uncertain, the Fed penciled in three rate cuts for this year in its last meeting. This shift in its monetary policy approach is a result of gradual control of inflation and aims to support a stable economic environment without triggering a recession or a significant rise in unemployment.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PKG in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.83 per share for PKG, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80 per share.

First, according to the website Medical Inspiration Daily For Stronger Society (MIDSS), its poll of 3,000 Gen Z individuals (defined as people born between 1997 to 2012) represents the main driver of the U.S. vegan market.

Also, Netflix's licensing rights for some popular shows and movies are returning to their original owners. As a result, and with competition surging, Netflix has been forced to seek growth from other sources."", ""For the last several years, the company's revenue growth relied on big investments in original content to entice people to subscribe, along with recurring subscription price hikes. However, many competing platforms also offer original content, and raising subscription prices too much carries the risk of inducing a mass churn among subscribers."", 'A little over a year ago, Netflix launched its latest tool for generating revenue and earnings growth: a lower-priced subscription tier featuring ads.', ""Earlier this month, a top manager shed some light on the progress of Netflix's ad business. Let's dig in and assess whether now is a good time to scoop up shares of Netflix."", 'In November 2022, Netflix began offering its advertising tier in 12 countries -- just a small slice of the 190-odd countries in which operates.', ""While watching commercials during a show or movie can be distracting, the carrot is that this tier is Netflix's most affordable pricing plan. Anecdotally, I had reached my limit with the streamer's price hikes, but was not at a point where canceling entirely seemed like the optimal solution. So when the company released its ad-supported tier, I jumped at the opportunity to alter my subscription."", ""One year into this reimagined Netflix, I can't say I've noticed much of a difference -- and I'm not the only one. According to a company-issued note back in November, Netflix boasted 15 million global monthly active users (MAUs) on its advertising tier. Moreover, in the company's third-quarter earnings report, management stated that 30% of new signups were on the advertising tier."", ""Although this growth is encouraging, a more recent announcement from the company raised my eyebrows. According to recent commentary from Amy Reinhard, Netflix's president of advertising, the company's ad tier now has over 23 million MAUs."", 'Not only is this a notable increase from November, but the inflow of new subscribers on this plan is coming at a very interesting time.', 'When it comes to advertising, one of the most important aspects for investors to understand is that spending is cyclical. And 2024 is likely to be a year in which ad spending ticks up given the election cycle just getting underway.', 'According to a report from AdImpact, political campaign ad spending in the U.S. is forecast to eclipse $10 billion this year and hit the highest level ever.', 'While the majority of that spending is expected to be allocated toward broadcast and cable television, the AdImpact report suggests $2.5 billion will go towards ads on connected TV devices and digital platforms.', ""I suspect political campaigns -- and brands in general -- will want to reach the eyes of the rising number of people subscribing to Netflix's ad tier. As such, it could end up seeing a more meaningful contribution to its financials from those ad-supported subscriptions in 2024."", ""As a growth stock, Netflix often trades with some hard-to-stomach volatility. It seems like each quarter, investors either cheer or jeer the company based on its subscriber growth numbers. But over the long term, Netflix has proven in many different ways that it can generate meaningful growth. Netflix currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 30.1 -- well below the company's three-year average of 37.1."", ""Given that advertising has only been a feature of the platform for a little over a year, and in a limited way, it's highly unlikely that this new offering is moving the needle just yet. However, there are clear signs that more people are choosing this option, which could be a long-term catalyst for its financials. Furthermore, its success in a small number of its markets could lead it to gradually expand this offering to more geographies."", ""As more people sign up for Netflix's ad-supported tier, the company should eventually be able to command more attractive pricing terms from marketers and brands looking for additional surface area on the streaming giant. While it still has a lot to prove, early signs indicate that Netflix's bet is paying off. Overall, I am bullish that advertising will be a meaningful driver for the streamer over the long term, and think that 2024 could be a great year for the company."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

Apple is banking on entertainment content to help market the nascent and pricey technology, and Netflix is a must-have streaming service for many consumers. Netflix also offers apps for Apple’s other devices, including the iPhone and iPad, though it doesn’t participate in the company’s TV app.', 'The Vision Pro will run two main types of apps: new software written specifically for the device’s interface or existing iPad applications. Apple has sought to make it easy to transfer developers’ current iPad apps over to the new platform, aiming to quickly amass a wide range of Vision Pro software.', 'The fact that Netflix isn’t even willing to support the iPad approach suggests that it’s taking a wait-and-see stance with the headset. It’s also a bit of a reversal for the company, which said in July that it would support its iPad app on the Vision Pro. Even then, though, Netflix didn’t plan to release software specifically for the headset’s operating system, visionOS.', '“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement. Apple declined to comment.', 'In contrast with its Vision Pro strategy, Netflix did develop an app for Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest headsets, though it hasn’t been updated in years.', 'The approach means it will be harder for users to access Netflix on the Vision Pro. And they won’t be able to download Netflix content to watch offline, potentially making it more of a pain to use on an airplane.', 'The lack of an app also means Netflix watchers won’t have access to custom environments for streaming. That means Netflix can’t create specialized immersive backdrops for its users to watch videos in.', 'While Netflix and Apple don’t compete in TV hardware, they’re both currently vying for subscribers in the streaming industry. Apple is a small player in this category, with less than 10% of the US market. But it’s been gathering award wins in the space, and the two companies compete over talent and production deals. It’s plausible Netflix doesn’t want to help boost a rival by giving it a key app for its upcoming launch.', 'Apple has been marketing the Vision Pro as an entertainment device in the run-up to preorders beginning on Friday. The Cupertino, California-based company said earlier this week that the headset would have many entertainment options beyond its own TV+ service.

While many investors can screen good ideas, there is lack of patience when it comes to holding stocks. The millionaire-making secret is to hold high-growth stocks that represent businesses with potential and review business developments on an annual basis. If business fundamentals are sound and there is scope to boost cash flows, valuation readjustments will follow.', 'This column discusses seven stocks that are likely to be massive value creators by 2030. I have selected a mix of blue-chip, growth, and penny stocks. The idea is to have a diversified long-term portfolio with potential five or ten-baggers.', 'Besides company specific fundamentals, I have looked at sectors that look promising not just until 2030, but potentially beyond. Let’s look at the reasons to be bullish on these stories.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com', 'Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has witnessed a challenging journey in the last decade and can be finally classified as a blue-chip. The Company has proved skeptics wrong and I believe that TSLA stock will continue to create immense value.', 'In September 2023, billionaire investor Ron Baron opined that Tesla’s valuation can “grow between four- and five-fold between now and 2030.” This is very likely in my view considering the company’s ambitious growth plans.', 'To put things into perspective, Tesla is targeting annual electric vehicle (EV) production of 20 million units by 2030. Anna-Marie Baisden of Fitch Solutions believes that the target is “going to be a challenge.” However, considering the impending penetration of EVs globally, it’s not unrealistic.', 'Further, Tesla has been delivering robust cash flows and the balance sheet is strong. I don’t see any financing concerns. With possible manufacturing in markets like India and Indonesia, there is visibility for robust deliveries growth. I must add that Tesla has been an innovator, which will continue to give the company an edge over peers.', 'Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com', 'I believe that gold is likely to surge higher as an asset class in the coming years. The reasons include inflation, low real interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. A good proxy for investment in gold is a gold mining company. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is another blue-chip that can deliver fivefold returns by 2030.', 'Newmont is among the largest gold miners in the world with 2022 reserves of 96.1 million ounces. The recent acquisition of Newcrest Mining (OTCMKTS:NCMGF) will add to the reserve base and production visibility.', 'It’s worth noting that for Q3 2023, Newmont reported cash flow from continuing operations of $1 billion. As gold trends higher and production increases, operating and free cash flows will swell. This will translate into higher dividends and share purchase. With an investment grade balance sheet, Newmont will also be positioned for further inorganic growth. With NEM stock being depressed in the last 12 months, it’s a good opportunity to accumulate.', 'Source: MEE KO DONG / Shutterstock', 'The banking sector serves as a backbone for growth in any economy. This is the reason to be bullish on HDFC Bank (NYSE:HDB) as a potential value creator. The Indian banking stock has been sideways in the last 12 months. However, the merger with HDFC (home loan company) has been completed and the stock seems poised for a breakout rally.', 'From a long-term perspective, the best part of growth for India might be witnessed in the coming years. With focus on infrastructure, defense, housing, manufacturing, among others, the economy seems poised for a take-off. This is likely to benefit HDFC Bank.', 'If we look at the fundamentals of one of the largest Indian banks, there are reasons to be optimistic. As of Q2 2023, gross non-performing assets were low at 1.34%. Further, the capital adequacy ratio was 19.5% and is likely to improve in the coming quarters.', 'Given a strong network of 7,945 branches across India, I expect sustained growth on increasing banking penetration. Further, households are not significantly leveraged and this provides scope for growth from the merged entity.', 'Source: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com', 'Among EV growth stocks, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is my top pick for multibagger returns. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 24, the high-growth name looks deeply undervalued. While the investment horizon is until 2030, I expect LI stock to deliver 100% returns this year.', 'For Q4 2023, Li Auto reported delivery of 131,805 cars, which was higher by 184.6% on a year-on-year (YOY) basis. Even for the full year, deliveries growth was stellar at 182.2%. I must add that vehicle margin and free cash flows have been robust. This has translated into high financial flexibility for aggressive growth. As of Q3 2023, Li Auto reported cash and equivalents of $12.13 billion.', 'For the current year, I expect deliveries growth to remain strong on the back of two factors. First, Li MEGA is due for mass deliveries in March. Further, Li Auto continues to aggressively expand its retail network in China. Additionally, there are speculations about the company’s first international foray with the likely market being the Middle-East.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock has surged by 183% in the last 12 months. The rally from deeply oversold levels is likely to sustain with profitability on the horizon. Further, with a big addressable market for online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming, I believe that DKNG stock will continue to create value.', 'To put things into perspective, the total addressable market for OSB and iGaming is expected to swell to $30 billion by 2028. This is just for the states where the company is currently operating. As more states legalize OSB and iGaming, the addressable market will swell.', 'It’s therefore not surprising that DraftKings is on a stellar growth trajectory. Further, for 2024, the company has provided a positive adjusted EBITDA guidance of $400 million (mid-range). It’s expected that EBITDA will swell to $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion respectively in 2026 and 2028. The guidance is for operations in existing states. It’s likely that the company will exceed this guidance with entry into new states.', 'Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com', 'Let’s also talk about a few penny stocks that can be massive wealth creators. Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is worth considering at current levels of $2.1. In my view, 10x returns are likely until 2030.', 'Recently, Tilray reported Q2 2024 numbers and revenue increased by 34% on a YOY basis to $194 million. Besides 31% YOY growth in cannabis revenue in Canada, Tilray reported 55% growth in international cannabis revenue. The growth driver outside Canada was medicinal cannabis. Further, the company’s alcohol net revenue increased by 117% to $47 million.', 'A key point is that Tilray is well diversified and with a big addressable market, the growth outlook is robust. Tilray has also reiterated the guidance for positive adjusted free cash flow for financial year 2024. With all these positives, the company seems to be on the right track for value creation. I would expect a strong rally from deeply oversold levels.', 'Source: 3rdtimeluckystudio / Shutterstock', 'Last on the list of high-growth stocks is Standard Lithium (NYSE:SLI), the second potential penny stock that I would buy and hold. While lithium prices have crashed last year, it’s expected that the supply-gap for the metal will be acute by 2035. I therefore expect lithium to trend higher in the coming years. With a game-changing asset, Standard Lithium can be a millionaire-maker.', 'To put things into perspective, Standard Lithium commands a market valuation of just $330 million. However, the company’s key asset has an after-tax base-case net present value of $4.5 billion. Further, another Lanxess asset has an after-tax net present value of $722 million. Clearly, SLI stock is massively undervalued.', 'Besides the lithium price correction, the need for financing the project has kept the stock depressed. Once there is a potential partnership or financing agreement, I expect SLI to trend higher. Of course, the company is likely to be a cash flow machine once the project is commercialized.', 'On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some downgrades may be ahead, and this could impact the stock’s current “Strong Buy” standing. My guess is that analysts won’t have to change their theses by all too much. Further, the stock is 20% cheaper than just over two weeks ago.', 'Matthew Akers of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) recently downgraded BA stock from Buy to Hold. However, his $225.00 price target still entails a 10.8% upside from current levels.', 'Boeing stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 18 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average BA stock price target\xa0of $269.26 implies 32.6% upside potential.', 'General Dynamics stock has been underwhelming over the past year, rising just 8% over the timespan. The defense company’s subsidiaries have been winning over some impressive contracts of late, with the latest one worth $170.8 million coming from none other than the U.S. Air Force.', 'Should geopolitical tensions continue to mount, it’s hard not to look at shares of GD as a great way to defend one’s portfolio from the turmoil. As one of the most intriguing (and reliable) firms in the defense scene, I have to stay bullish going into 2024 as the stock looks to pick up traction and make a run for new highs again.', 'At 16.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), shares of GD stand out as a relative bargain in the industry. Shares look a heck of a lot cheaper than the aerospace & defense industry average of 21.6 times forward P/E. Given that General Dynamics is a well-diversified defense play (it has air, land, and sea covered), I view the discount to industry averages as a tad unwarranted. Indeed, Wall Street recommendations seem to suggest that GD stock is perhaps undervalued, with promising upside in the new year.', 'With its Aerospace, Combat Systems, and Marine Systems businesses (covering air, land, and sea, respectively), GD stock truly is a great one-stop-shop for value hunters seeking an all-around defensive play.', 'General Dynamics stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average GD stock price target\xa0of $289.36 implies 15.76% upside potential.', 'Finally, we have an airline that’s been experiencing massive turbulence since the dark days of 2020, when the pandemic sent shares nosediving into the abyss. Over the past two years, DAL stock has fallen by over 5%, making the turbulent play a rough and unrewarding ride for long-term shareholders.', 'Looking ahead, Wall Street thinks the airline play may finally have what it takes to lift off the tarmac, perhaps offering a somewhat smoother ride for investors. After the latest pullback, I think Delta (and its peers) represents a great value opportunity. As such, I’m staying bullish on the stock.', 'It’s been a turbulent 2024, with shares down 7.37% year-to-date. Delta recently reported applaud-worthy record revenues in its latest quarter, but the market has a mind of its own. And right now, they’re no fans of the airlines as we move further into the new year. What’s behind the ugliness of the airline stocks?', 'Higher oil prices are part of the reason airlines are feeling the turbulence again. Additionally, a looming recession and cautious profit guidance ($6.00-7.00 earnings per share expected for the full year) from management may be making investors a tad jittery.', 'Though it’s hard to catch the bottom of airline stocks, I view DAL stock as a well-managed airline that has what it takes to power higher, if not in 2024, perhaps within the next three years. Though there are headwinds ahead, we can’t ignore the fact the firm recently clocked in impressive revenue numbers. The airline has demonstrated strokes of brilliance, yet many investors won’t have it. Perhaps it’s time to take a contrarian view while shares (and expectations) have fallen off a bit.', 'Delta stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average DAL stock price target\xa0of $53.33 implies 43.6% upside potential.', 'The three aforementioned aircraft-related stocks have been turbulent rides of late, but Wall Street thinks they could zip higher this year. Despite their troubles, I do agree investors are way too pessimistic at this juncture, especially if that soft economic landing is in store. Of the trio, Wall Street expects the most gains from DAL stock (~43.6%) for the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', 'As of today, General Dynamics Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.10% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.12%.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, General Dynamics Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.44."", ""General Dynamics Corp's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

Coupled with its solid profitability rank, the company appears to maintain a stable foundation for its dividends. However, investors should also consider the company's growth metrics, which suggest that while General Dynamics Corp is capable of sustaining its dividends, its growth rates are not leading the industry. This mixed picture highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to dividend investing, considering both the security of current payments and the potential for future growth.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.5%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $11.93 billion, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.39% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

149,1342a0fe-31f3-3bed-9328-b564ec345bfd,NRG,2024-01-18,5 High ROE Stocks to Buy as Markets Dip on Inflation Worry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-high-roe-stocks-buy-124900072.html,1705495740,STORY,"['CBOE', 'NRG', 'ACGL', 'SUZ']","['Over the past few trading days, the broader U.S. equity markets witnessed a downtrend owing to higher-than-expected inflation data. Per the latest reports, the consumer price index increased 0.3% in December month over month and 3.4% on a year-over-year basis compared with broader expectations of a 0.2% and 3.2% rise, respectively, primarily due to higher rents and food prices. This portrays that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to slow down inflation to its 2% target will likely remain bumpy in the year ahead.\xa0 \xa0Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023. However, the Fed might revert to its rate hike policy should inflation witness an uptrend in the near future. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations. To add to the woes, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has indicated that the easing of monetary policy might come slower than anticipated, propelling the 10-year Treasury yields.The 10-year Treasury yield has moved up in excess of 4% despite solid fourth-quarter earnings performance from hitherto reported companies and relatively modest economic data. The December non-farm payrolls report showed that the jobless rate held steady at 3.7%, while the economy added 216,000 jobs compared with 173,000 revised job additions in November, signifying economic strength. The latest GDP data projections also reveal that the economy is likely to grow at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Arch Resources, Inc. ARCH, Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.', 'ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.', ""In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.\xa0 \xa0Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:NRG Energy: Headquarters in Houston, TX, NRG Energy is engaged in the production, sale and delivery of energy and energy products and services to residential, industrial and commercial consumers in major competitive power markets in the United States.

Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Patterson Companies Inc has increased its dividend each year since 2010.

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, Patterson Companies Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.53% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.53%.

Based on Patterson Companies Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Patterson Companies Inc stock as of today is approximately 3.53%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio.

This suggests an uncertain path toward interest rate cuts and reflects a growing sense that inflation is under control (read: 4 ETF Zones Beating the Market to Start 2024).The latest data on inflation, which came in modestly hotter than expected, has dampened market expectations about an interest rate hike as soon as March. Though the job data report for December came in stronger than expected, it also cast doubt on the expectations of March rate cuts. The disappointing manufacturing data also added to the chaos. The U.S. manufacturing sector slipped further into contraction in December, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global, as output declined and the downturn in new orders gathered pace.Markets are pricing in a 71.4% chance of a 25 bps rate cut in March, compared with an 81% probability in the prior session, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.While the timing of interest rate cuts is uncertain, the Fed penciled in three rate cuts for this year in its last meeting. This shift in its monetary policy approach is a result of gradual control of inflation and aims to support a stable economic environment without triggering a recession or a significant rise in unemployment.

The devices can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings, summarize web articles, fix handwriting and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.', 'The launch is one of the most ambitious attempts to weave AI into a smartphone’s interface and features. The new devices also provide Google with a chance to put its most advanced software in the hands of more users, a potential edge in its fight for AI dominance with Microsoft Corp. and startup OpenAI.', 'The AI features are the highlight of the new phones, but the devices are also getting slimmer bezels and brighter displays. Samsung is paying special attention to its top-end model, the S24 Ultra. That product, which starts at $1,299, will have a new titanium frame, matching the iPhone 15 Pro models released in September.', 'The borders around the displays are 42% thinner, and the screen is 40% brighter than the phone’s predecessor.

That flexibility helped Google’s offerings stand out from the competition, Kurian said.', 'In conjunction with Samsung’s announcements, Google also introduced a feature called “Circle to Search,” which lets people search anything on their phone screens without switching apps. Users of Google’s Android operating system can scribble or circle on top of images, text or video in the app they’re on – say, YouTube Shorts or TikTok – to find out more information about the item. The feature is launching globally on the new Galaxy S24, as well as on Google’s own Pixel 8 smartphones on Jan. 31.', 'AI features on the Samsung devices will also let users change the language of a message depending on the context, such as whether it’s a work memo or social media post. And new capabilities for Android Auto — Google’s in-car interface — will summarize incoming text messages and other alerts.', 'The companies are also applying AI to the phones’ camera systems, which are getting upgraded with new sensors, with tools to make photos sharper. The S24 Ultra replaces one of its 10-megapixel telephoto cameras with a 50-megapixel version. The S24 and S24+, meanwhile, include the same camera specifications as their predecessors.', 'The S24 Ultra comes with as much as 1 terabyte of storage, while the S24+ tops out at 512 gigabytes.

By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations.

This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.', 'Despite a decline in worldwide dividend payouts, experts anticipate a potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the coming year.

Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential. Unlike the conventional defensive categories like utilities, he emphasized the importance of investing in dividend stocks that exhibit growth qualities.

Moreover, as these businesses grow earnings, they increase their dividends periodically, gradually increasing your yield on cost.', 'As this year starts, it is time to bolster your portfolio income. While plenty of dividend stocks exist, focusing on the best of breed is worthwhile. Some of the best dividend stocks for consistent income are on the Dividends Aristocrats List.

Typically, they sell an irreplaceable, essential product, allowing them to earn consistent cashflows to support dividends. Thus, it’s one of the first sectors to consider for dividend income.', 'NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the top dividend stocks in the utility sector. But the company isn’t any boring utility.

However, investors have overreacted, and fundamentals are solid, as the Q2 FY2024 results revealed.', 'Indeed, in the Q2 FY2024 earnings call, management emphatically stated they were seeing minimal impact. CEO Geoff Martha noted, “…outside of a modest impact on the bariatric surgery market, which we believe will be temporary, we don’t see these drugs impacting Medtronic’s growth outlook, even long-term.” This sentiment was reflected in results where the diabetes segment grew organic revenues 6.7% year-over-year, the highest growth rate in 10 quarters.', 'Even if GLP-1s were to have an impact, the diabetes segment accounts for less than 4% of operating profit.

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Merck. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Merck's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.

The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', ""Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Merck & Co., Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$177m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. "", 'The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Merck. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.', ""It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

Now that's what they're seeing, Kevin, but I'm interested to get Kevin's look. How do you see the US economy, Kevin, kind of unfolding here in 2024? Are you in the soft landing camp, the downturn camp? Where are you?"", ""KEVIN MAHN: Sure. The long awaited economic slowdown is finally coming to fruition. And I think the Fed's own projections here bear that out. If you look at 2024, the Fed has projected that GDP is going to slow to 1.4% and then stay below 2% all the way through the end of the year."", ""Now that's a slowdown, and that should be a relatively soft landing.

But an economic slowdown is coming, and investors would be wise to position their portfolios into areas such as health care, consumer staples, and industrials, notably the aerospace and defense sector."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Let's dig into that. So that's the backdrop, now let's talk about where you see buys. One name, and I think our viewers are going to recognize this one this, is Northrop Grumman. You believe, Kevin, this one is a buy here. It's one people should commit capital to."", ""Let's go some of the reasons for this. First one, you have, Kevin, here since it's your bullets, why you think this one's wants to own may gain from defense spending. Talk about that with us."", ""KEVIN MAHN: Absolutely. Over the course of the next decade, defense spending in our country is projected to increase from roughly $783 billion to $1.2 trillion. That's nearly a 50% increase over the next decade. We also know that since 1960 as a percentage of our GDP, military spending has decreased every single year, gone up in dollar terms, gone down as a percentage of GDP. So we need to increase defense spending, which has only been further drained by us helping out necessarily so other countries across the globe over the last two years and likely in the year ahead."", ""So who's going to be the primary benefactor of this increase in defense spending? One such name is Northrop Grumman."", 'JOSH LIPTON: All right. Second bullet point there, strong stock performance.', ""KEVIN MAHN: Absolutely. Up just over 2% year-to-date over the last three years, annualizing out to about 19% per annum. That's pretty good, especially for a defensive defense name."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And finally here, final bullet point, strong balance sheet pays a dividend. So a strong balance sheet and you like the capital return.', ""KEVIN MAHN: Absolutely. So it's got a dividend yield of around 1.5%. And here's the statistic for all the viewers to look at, it's called the Altman Z-score. It was pioneered by an NYU professor, right around the corner from here, back in 1968. And it helps to predict the probability of a company declaring bankruptcy over the next two years. So those companies with an Altman Z-score are three or better are less likely to declare bankruptcy. Those with three or below are more likely."", ""Guess what? Their Altman Z-score, 4.2. Strong balance sheets, pays a dividend, likely to be a benefactor of increased defense spending, and their stock's been doing pretty well."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. Kevin, so you've made a very strong case here. Before our viewers decide, they're going to go all in, commit capital to Northrop Grumman. Talk about some of the risks they should consider."", ""KEVIN MAHN: Certainly. This is a presidential election year. We don't know who ultimately is going to be running for president, much less likely to occupy the Oval Office over the course of the next four years or who's going to be in control of Congress. What if that forecast increase in defense spending doesn't come to fruition? That's certainly a risk for this type of outlook."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And one last question before we move on, Northrop Grumman is a buy. What about some of the peers? Lockheed Martin, is that also another name you like?', 'KEVIN MAHN: Absolutely, Josh. Lockheed Martin is another name that we like, and we hold within one of our portfolios at smart trust, has a little bit more of an attractive dividend yield of roughly 2.6%. The exact same Altman Z-score of 4.2, but also trading in an attractive valuation and with a PE of around 16 right now.', ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. So we got the name you like. Let's move on. Which name you don't like, Kevin? Another one, I think, by the way, viewers are going to be very well aware of Virgin Galactic. Let's go through some of the reasons here. First one, unlikely to gain from defense spending."", ""KEVIN MAHN: I can't imagine any of these forecasted increases in defense or military spending going towards individual manned spacecrafts. This is obviously no disrespect to Sir Richard Branson. It's in the aerospace and defense sector. But it really isn't a defense name. It's an aerospace name. And it's a luxury item, not a staple item."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. Second reason here, now the stock a struggling, and struggling is putting it kindly here, right? I mean, this stock has been hammered, right? Kevin, it's down about 65% in the past 12 months. That's another reason you're saying to avoid it. You don't think-- you don't think all the bad news is priced in here?"", ""KEVIN MAHN: I think there's even more downside from here. Down 20% year-to-date over the last three years, it's down around 59% per annum over that time period. I just don't see the outlook for this getting better, especially if we're going into that economic slowdown period that we spoke about earlier. What individuals are going to pay the money to actually fly to space? There's a very low likelihood of that. And we'll get to the other reasons why. I think this company is going to struggle. But certainly, the space is an area, pun intended, that's not going to get a lot of attention."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And this one, the third reason, basically, you're saying, this is the polar opposite of Northrop Grumman."", ""KEVIN MAHN: Absolutely. Negative earnings, their Altman Z-score is negative. So there is a high likelihood of this company declaring bankruptcy over the next two years, at least according to that statistic. They don't pay a dividend. And it's just tough to imagine them growing their balance sheet, growing their earnings in the likelihood of a slowing economy that's forecast over the next three years."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And let's end here, Kevin. So before you decide to avoid this name altogether, your point being we're not getting a lot of cooperation here on the tech side. It's OK, we've got Kevin here to walk us through it."", 'KEVIN MAHN: No problem.', 'JOSH LIPTON: What are some upside risks here? In other words, what would turn you bullish on this name?', 'KEVIN MAHN: Sure.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Here we go. Now we got it.', 'KEVIN MAHN: The company is still bullish that they can actually launch the Delta spacecraft. And they forecast that they could potentially be cash flow even by the end of 2026. Time will tell. Those forecasts seem to be coming from outer space to me. So this is a name that I put in the goodbye category, not the good buy category.', ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. So let's sum this up here for the viewers paying attention. So you're telling investors by Northrop Grumman due to its healthy balance sheet, strong performance, the potential to take a slice of that government defense spending. On the flip side, though, Kevin is saying avoid Virgin Galactic as it is not likely to receive any of that funding, the lack of dividend, and its poor performance over the last few years.""]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'Investors across the globe are increasingly drawn to stocks that provide regular dividends as a strategy to secure a steady income stream. To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.', 'In 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.', 'Despite a decline in worldwide dividend payouts, experts anticipate a potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the coming year. The yields experienced a decline towards the end of 2023, and there is a possibility of further decreases if the Federal Reserve decides to reduce interest rates. The outlook suggests that despite the prevailing challenges, dividend stocks might see a rebound in the future. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential. Unlike the conventional defensive categories like utilities, he emphasized the importance of investing in dividend stocks that exhibit growth qualities. According to Adam, his firm specifically focuses on dividend stocks that not only present favorable valuations but also demonstrate the capability to sustain their growth over time.', ""Mr. Adam's inclination toward dividend growth stocks aligns with historical evidence indicating their consistent outperformance. Looking at the Russell 1000 index, companies that increased their dividends exhibited an average stock price outperformance of 3.1% in the six months following the announcement of the dividend increase, as per Morgan Stanley data from 2014 onwards. In contrast, companies that reduced their dividends experienced an underperformance of 4.7% in stock prices during the same six-month period."", 'Expanding on these points, we will explore the best global dividend stocks in this article.', 'Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds for the third quarter of 2023 and picked companies that operate internationally.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'Investors across the globe are increasingly drawn to stocks that provide regular dividends as a strategy to secure a steady income stream. To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.', 'In 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.', 'Despite a decline in worldwide dividend payouts, experts anticipate a potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the coming year. The yields experienced a decline towards the end of 2023, and there is a possibility of further decreases if the Federal Reserve decides to reduce interest rates. The outlook suggests that despite the prevailing challenges, dividend stocks might see a rebound in the future. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential. Unlike the conventional defensive categories like utilities, he emphasized the importance of investing in dividend stocks that exhibit growth qualities. According to Adam, his firm specifically focuses on dividend stocks that not only present favorable valuations but also demonstrate the capability to sustain their growth over time.', ""Mr. Adam's inclination toward dividend growth stocks aligns with historical evidence indicating their consistent outperformance. Looking at the Russell 1000 index, companies that increased their dividends exhibited an average stock price outperformance of 3.1% in the six months following the announcement of the dividend increase, as per Morgan Stanley data from 2014 onwards.

Unfortunately for PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) investors, that trend persisted in 2021 and 2022. PayPal's stock has lost value for three straight years, but there are some strong indicators pointing toward a recovery year in 2024. So, if you're looking for a great stock pick for 2024, PayPal is shaping up to be one of the best."", 'Part of the reason many of the fabled ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks did well in 2023 is that they entered the year at a low valuation. Sometimes, the market gets too pessimistic about businesses, and all it takes is one solid quarter to kick-start a new wave of growth.', 'Meanwhile, PayPal stock is still trading at unbelievably low levels, making the stock appear attractive.', ""Compared to the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.2, PayPal trades at a significant discount to the broader market. Essentially, investors are saying PayPal is a below-average business in the index, which is a huge mistake."", ""Because PayPal's stock is so undervalued, management has been doing the right thing: aggressively repurchasing shares. By taking advantage of the cheap stock price, PayPal has repurchased nearly 5% of its outstanding shares in just one year."", ""That provides a huge earnings-per-share boost, as the business only needs to grow net income at about 5% to provide investors with a market-beating growth pace. While PayPal's net income growth has been a bit inconsistent as of late, it's working toward returning to the highs achieved in 2021."", 'If PayPal can provide solid and sustainable earnings growth, it will provide investors with market-beating growth.', 'The third quarter marked the start of new CEO Alex Chriss. Chriss has taken his time getting to know the business, and on PayPal\'s Q3 conference call he noted one item in particular that investors must know: ""We will become leaner, more efficient, and more effective, driving greater velocity, innovation, and impact for customers.""', ""Becoming more efficient should allow PayPal to grow its net income consistently while participating in an aggressive share buyback program. We'll likely learn more about Chriss's strategy in PayPal's Q4 report (expected on Feb. 7), but he has the right focus for a business that is no longer considered focused on growth."", ""While increasing efficiency and repurchasing shares is one way of increasing a company's earnings-per-share figure, so is growing revenue. Despite the market's indications, PayPal has reliably grown its revenue over the past year."", ""While it wasn't at the lightning pace it had been growing earlier, PayPal has increased revenue by at least 6.7% over the past two years. If PayPal could repurchase shares at its current rate, maintain its margins, and grow at the same pace, its earnings would outpace the market."", ""However, with all three events happening concurrently, don't be surprised to see PayPal grow its earnings consistently in the 15% to 20% range until the market recognizes PayPal's stock is investment-worthy and starts scooping it up again."", ""Wall Street hasn't done that yet, so you have an opportunity to get in now before bigger firms do.

Three stocks that I'd be willing to deploy $500 to buy are PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)."", ""These three don't have much in common from a business mindset, but their stocks share the same trait: undervaluation."", 'PayPal is a leader in the payment processing space and can be used by consumers and merchants to manage payment methods. PayPal also has a popular peer-to-peer payment service in Venmo and an unbranded payment processing product in Braintree, which is used to make a more custom payment processing experience.', 'Airbnb is the market leader in alternative stays and experiences and has consistently grown its network to include a global array of options. Despite many people thinking that Airbnb would struggle as consumers cut their spending and various municipalities banned short-term rentals, the company continued to do just fine.', ""Meta Platforms is better known by its former name, Facebook. While Meta has a Reality Labs division that handles its pursuits related to the metaverse, the real moneymaker is its family of apps, which includes Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. This makes Meta's revenue stream dependent on advertising, which struggled in late 2022 and early 2023 but strengthened as of the third quarter."", 'All three of these businesses are at the top of their respective industries, making them good investments, but their low valuations make them great buys now.', ""Because all three companies are mature and optimized for profits, I'll focus on their price-to-earnings valuation."", ""PayPal is the cheapest of the group, as it trades for a dirt-cheap 18 times trailing earnings and 11 times forward earnings (which uses analysts' projections). That's a massive discount to the broader market, as the S&P 500 trades for around 19.5 times forward earnings, according to FactSet."", ""Airbnb's price-to-earnings ratio is skewed due to a one-time income tax provision that caused its earnings per share to more than triple. Instead, I'll use its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio to value it."", ""From this data point, Airbnb is right in its historical valuation range. When valuing a company by free cash flow (FCF), a good rule of thumb is to invert this metric to get FCF yield. Doing this gives you an FCF yield of 4.6%. Then, you compare this figure to the current 10-year treasury yield rate. With the 10-year sitting just below 4%, Airbnb will generate more cash than a risk-free asset -- even if it doesn't grow. With Airbnb having a higher yield, it shows that it's a very cheap stock."", ""Finally, Meta Platforms may look expensive if you look at their trailing earnings; its price-to-earnings ratio is 33. However, this is a flawed analysis, as it includes three quarters in a weak advertising market. Instead, investors should use the forward price-to-earnings ratio to factor in the growth it will experience this year. From that viewpoint, Meta's stock is valued at 21 times forward earnings. While this is more expensive than the S&P 500, Meta is a much better company than the average one in the index, earning it a premium."", 'PayPal, Airbnb, and Meta Platforms are three companies you can confidently buy right now, as their businesses are strong and their stocks are cheap. Picking up shares of this trio now is a good move, as these stocks may become more popular as the market diverts its attention from other highly valued investments.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'Investors across the globe are increasingly drawn to stocks that provide regular dividends as a strategy to secure a steady income stream. To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.', 'In 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.', 'Despite a decline in worldwide dividend payouts, experts anticipate a potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the coming year. The yields experienced a decline towards the end of 2023, and there is a possibility of further decreases if the Federal Reserve decides to reduce interest rates. The outlook suggests that despite the prevailing challenges, dividend stocks might see a rebound in the future. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential. Unlike the conventional defensive categories like utilities, he emphasized the importance of investing in dividend stocks that exhibit growth qualities. According to Adam, his firm specifically focuses on dividend stocks that not only present favorable valuations but also demonstrate the capability to sustain their growth over time.', ""Mr. Adam's inclination toward dividend growth stocks aligns with historical evidence indicating their consistent outperformance. Looking at the Russell 1000 index, companies that increased their dividends exhibited an average stock price outperformance of 3.1% in the six months following the announcement of the dividend increase, as per Morgan Stanley data from 2014 onwards. In contrast, companies that reduced their dividends experienced an underperformance of 4.7% in stock prices during the same six-month period."", 'Expanding on these points, we will explore the best global dividend stocks in this article.', 'Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds for the third quarter of 2023 and picked companies that operate internationally.

By widening risk, I mean on a percentage basis, not a dollar-amount perspective.', 'For example, imagine that I usually risk 5% on a position. If the market becomes volatile, I can instead cut my position size in half and risk 10% on trades (In this example, my risk is double on a percentage basis but remains the same from a dollar-at-risk perspective).

The company is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products -- Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud -- which are driving top-line growth. Rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across mobile apps are major positives.Additionally, growth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Solid demand for Adobe’s commerce offerings and growing adoption of Acrobat. Adobe’s strong market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation remain positives.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.2%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $17.12 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.97% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM?', ""For IBM, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects.

So listen, we know Elon Musk has made it very clear he is willing to play the volume game even at the expense of margins. If you're a Tesla investor, you're well aware of this. So Tesla cutting prices in Germany, it sounds like, Madison, for two versions of its Model Y. And that follows China, where Tesla cut the price of its entry-level Model Y and lowered the Model Y starting price as well."", ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah, you have to wonder, if you are someone who is interested in buying a Tesla, why would you not wait for them to continue to cut prices? And that's what some folks on the street are saying today. Are they training the consumer to wait for a better deal? Also an interesting note from Bank of America earlier this morning, you know, Josh, I've been obsessed with what's going on in the Red Sea and the potential impact."", ""The only company in their coverage that has announced disruptions from vessels rerouting is Tesla. Tesla expected to halt production at its Berlin facility from late June to early Feb. They expect other companies with a large footprint in Europe could be negatively affected. Not expecting huge downside, but it could be a temporary disruptor. So I think that's interesting to watch, with this name particularly, as so many investors are bullish on Tesla. You have to consider some of those geopolitical risks to come this year, Josh."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. By the way, did you see that piece in the New York Times today, kind of, talking about how batteries for EVs can be less efficient, have shorter range when it gets very, very cold out. They were kind of', ""MADISON MILLS: That's tough, yeah."", ""JOSH LIPTON: They were kind of profiling, talking to these EV fans in Chicago who are dealing with all these headaches right now, right? They've got, like, depleted batteries and long lines at the charging stations. It was an interesting piece, just we talk about how consumer demand for EVs is kind of waning, at least here in North America. But it was a good piece to read."", ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah, it's not as easy as you might think, at least when you are talking from the perspective of Hertz, for example, selling off 20,000 of their EV fleet because of the concerns from consumers, maybe overestimating some of that demand. Another auto stock that we're taking a look at here is Ford. Shares of that automaker sliding after UBS downgraded the stock to neutral. They're citing limited upside to expectations, and their price target for that name is at $12."", ""They said they see more potential for earnings upside at peer GM. They said they do like the CEO's vision and direction, but it could take a number of years for those benefits, the benefits of those plans to be realized. You're seeing that stock down over the past couple of months and in the past couple of days as well. Interesting to note, Josh, they say that the UAW deal costs Ford more than they originally thought, and that has been coming up since that deal happened. And I think that is a story that's going to be hovering over their shoulder for some time into the new year."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, in terms of what the analyst likes, by the way, he says he sees the potential for more earnings upside at GM. So in terms of names that he still likes, that's what he's telling his clients. If you look at Ford since early November, Madison, the stock's up about 12%, though still down more than 10% over the past year. It is interesting, you're seeing these downgrades for the carmakers even as rates are set to decline here. They've got this new labor deal in place. But for some on the street, valuation just doesn't look attractive at these levels."", ""MADISON MILLS: Yeah, but it's still interesting. I know you love to look at this. We've got 43% of analysts have a buy on this name. 46% have a hold. So it seems some mixed picture there from the analysts recommendations."", ""JOSH LIPTON: For sure. All right, let's get a final one here, a check on JetBlue. Shares of JetBlue and Spirit Airlines continuing to fall after a federal judge blocked JetBlue's $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines on Tuesday. So we know, Madison, the federal judge stepped in here, blocked the acquisition. And what does this mean for JetBlue is what I think investors are still trying to figure out."", ""And also, what it means for JetBlue's new CEO, remember, who takes over-- I think it's just next month. We did speak to Elaine Becker over at TD Cowen about this. Remember, she expects JetBlue to consider placing orders for aircraft, so it can grow organically. Though she told us that's going to take years to do versus what Spirit could have done with them much more quickly."", ""MADISON MILLS: Well, there's a potential read-through here outside of these two names to Alaska's proposed $1.9 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Holdings. Will that go through given that this deal did not, a judge blocking that merger, again on antitrust grounds. Hawaiian shares dropped a little over 3% today after declining yesterday on this news as well."", ""The market pricing in about a 65% of this transaction going through. That was at about 70% before the news broke about JetBlue and Spirit yesterday.

The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on General Motors’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for General Motors ', 'According to our valuation model, General Motors seems to be fairly priced at around 15.61% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy General Motors today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $30.61, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that General Motors’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of General Motors, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -3.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term."", 'Are you a shareholder? GM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on GM should the price fluctuate below its true value.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with General Motors, and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", 'If you are no longer interested in General Motors, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This student loan company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +363.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $382.71 million, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sallie Mae?', ""For Sallie Mae, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.97%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sallie Mae will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sallie Mae would post earnings of $0.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.11, delivering a surprise of -66.67%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Sallie Mae doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', 'Navient (NAVI), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter ended December 2023.

Travel rewards through airline and hotel partners, which support some of the biggest co-branded credit cards in the U.S., are a close second."", ""But Visa's move is a sign of changes that are likely to come in the next several years in the way card networks and banks manage traditional card rewards, as merchants push back against the existing card rewards system and technology evolves."", '""Cash rewards tend to be preferred by consumers, but if legislation like the Credit Card Competition Act gains scale, issuers that don\'t prepare in advance may be stuck with a model that doesn\'t meet the demands of consumers,"" said Brian Riley, director of credit advisory services and co-head of payments at Javelin Strategy & Research.', ""Visa's Web3 platform also anticipates new rewards-management technology including instant redemption and the ability to combine rewards with other offers to increase consumer engagement with brands, Riley noted."", '""Rewards continue to be a driving force in payments, but as issuers face regulators that want to disrupt the existing models, it\'s important to look downfield for ways to adapt,"" he said, adding Visa is pioneering a Web3 rewards program that could take years to develop.', ""Most banks are unlikely to abandon popular cash-back card programs any time soon, and Web3 is so new it's not on the radar of most consumers, according to analysts. But Web3's foundation in digital technology fits into the rapid digitization of payments, said David Shipper, a strategic advisor with Datos Insights."", '""Offering digital rewards makes a lot of sense with how consumers interact with the real and digital worlds, and Visa\'s idea could have legs if it\'s simple to use and consumers perceive the rewards as valuable,"" he said.', 'Digital rewards could also be created at a far lower cost than cash-back rewards. Combined with creative brand partnerships, issuers might find Web3 rewards to be a more practical way to reward consumers for debit card transactions, which can be costly to fund because the interchange rates for debit cards are significantly lower than credit card swipe fees, Shipper said.', 'To launch its Web3 loyalty platform, Visa has teamed with SmartMedia Technologies, a Carbondale, Colorado-based software firm that drives Web3 consumer engagement by distributing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for consumer promotions.

Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amphenol?', ""For Amphenol, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.74%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Amphenol will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amphenol would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of +5.41%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Amphenol appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

If you want to generate $300 in super safe dividend income in 2024, simply invest $4,175 (split equally, three ways) into the following three high-yield S&P 500 stocks, which sport an average yield of 7.2%!', 'The first high-octane income stock in the benchmark S&P 500 that can help pad your pocketbook in the new year is telecom company Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Despite bouncing decisively off of its October 2023 low, Verizon is still yielding nearly 7%, which is close to an all-time high.', ""Verizon faced something of a double whammy last year. First, rising interest rates made the prospect of future debt-financed acquisitions less appealing. It also meant refinancing the company's existing debt could be costlier."", 'The other issue for Verizon was the July report from The Wall Street Journal that suggested legacy telecom providers could face sizable monetary and/or environmental costs tied to the replacement of lead-sheathed cables still in use. Verizon has noted that lead-clad cables make up only a small percentage of its network.', 'Further, any liability would almost certainly be determined by the U.S. court system, which is notoriously slow. Long story short, the WSJ story looks to be a near-term nothingburger for investors.', ""What isn't a nothingburger is the modest but steady growth Verizon is enjoying from the 5G revolution. Upgrading its network to handle faster download speeds lifted wireless revenue by nearly 3% in the September-ended quarter and has been pivotal in sustaining a historically low churn rate."", 'Perhaps even more important is the surge in broadband net additions Verizon has observed following its purchase of mid-band spectrum in 2021. The ability to offer 5G internet speeds to businesses and residential customers led to 434,000 net additions in the third quarter and marked the fourth-consecutive quarter of at least 400,000 net adds. Broadband is a source of predictable cash flow for the company and the perfect dangling carrot to entice users to bundle their services.', ""Something else worth noting is that wireless service and internet access have effectively become basic necessities. Consumers might cancel their cable subscriptions to save a few dollars but are highly unlikely to go without internet access or wireless service. This makes Verizon's operating cash flow highly predictable from one year to the next."", ""Although Verizon isn't going to knock your socks off with its growth rate, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8 provides a safe floor with reasonable upside, as the operating benefits of the 5G revolution continue to be felt."", ""The second supercharged dividend stock in the S&P 500 that can help you bring home $300 in super safe dividend income in 2024 from a starting investment of $4,175 (split three ways) is tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Not only is Altria the highest-yielding S&P 500 component at nearly 9.5%, but it's raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years."", ""The biggest challenge for Altria is overcoming a shrinking percentage of adult smokers in the United States. Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the adult cigarette smoking rate has fallen from around 42% in the mid-1960s to just 11.5% as of 2021. With the public aware of the potential health risks associated with long-term tobacco use, it's unlikely this figure will rebound anytime soon."", ""Although a shrinking pool of smokers isn't ideal, it's not damning to Altria's operating model."", 'One thing Altria has working in its favor is that tobacco products contain nicotine. Since nicotine is an addictive chemical, Altria usually has no trouble passing along price increases that more than offset any decline in cigarette shipments.', ""To add to the above, Altria's premium cigarette brand Marlboro accounted for a greater-than-42% share of the cigarette market, as of the end of September. Controlling such a prominent piece of the pie gives the company more leeway to increase its prices without driving away its loyal customers."", ""However, it's Altria Group's evolution as a business that can make investors meaningfully richer. For example, the acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings for $2.75 billion in June gives the company access to the fast-growing e-vape market."", ""While Altria's investment in Juul didn't pan out, it's not making the same mistake twice. NJOY has landed a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products. MGOs are authorizations that allow e-vapor products to be sold. The overwhelming majority of e-vape products lack MGOs and could be pulled from retail shelves at any time."", 'With Altria generating bountiful cash flow from its traditional tobacco operations and expected to deliver meaningful long-term growth from its burgeoning smokeless segment, a forward P/E ratio of 8 appears to be a phenomenal deal.', 'The third high-yield S&P 500 stock that can help you generate $300 in super safe dividend income in 2024 from an initial investment of $4,175 (split equally across three stocks) is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O).

Accrdoing to Bloomberg, this development has raised speculations that the Federal Reserve may not be quick to implement interest rate cuts, given the apparent resilience of the economy. The likelihood of a March interest-rate cut, as indicated by Fed swaps, has now been trimmed to approximately 50%, reflecting a shift in market expectations. The surge in US retail sales, reported as the highest in three months, further intensified concerns among investors. The robust reading on retail sales triggered apprehensions about the efficacy of Wall Street's assertive dovish stance, especially in the context of favorable economic data. Central bank officials, adopting a more cautious tone regarding potential easing measures, added to the apprehension among traders. This cautious stance has created an environment where market participants are now readjusting their expectations, delaying the anticipated timing of the first Fed move. As a result, the odds of a rate reduction in the first quarter have been revised downward. The comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde underscore the concerns about aggressive market bets on interest-rate cuts. Lagarde emphasized that such speculative behavior in financial markets may not be conducive to policymakers' efforts and their ability to effectively manage economic challenges."", 'Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has commanded considerable attention at the World Economic Forum, drawing interest from major tech players like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google. In 2024, the spotlight has shifted to a more nuanced exploration of generative AI, with a specific emphasis on advancing the accuracy of AI results. This evolution is deemed critical for fostering confidence, particularly in high-stakes industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has emerged as a key advocate for this refinement, asserting that the next phase of AI development involves incorporating formal correctness into the underlying models. In an interview with CNBC, Gelsinger underscores the need for precision, especially in domains like medicine, manufacturing, and autonomous driving, where accuracy is paramount. Interviews with Gelsinger and Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, reveal a shared commitment to experimentation and co-piloting tests as instrumental strategies for improving accuracy and encouraging wider adoption of AI technologies. Shih introduces a pragmatic three-phase approach for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) adoption, which begins with assisting work, progresses to ensuring accuracy in autopilot mode, and ultimately leads to trusting the technology at chosen confidence levels. This phased approach aligns with the broader goal of making AGI more approachable and less intimidating, emphasizing the crucial role of human acceptance. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, contributes insights during panel discussions, characterizing AGI as a potent tool rather than a disruptive force replacing jobs. Altman underscores the collaborative potential of AI, describing it as an enhancer of productivity that amplifies human capabilities.', 'Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, reflects on the past year as a transformative period for AI, describing it as a time of discovery.

It is important to note that the industry context for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is crucial in understanding these recommendations. In the dynamic landscape of the technology sector, Intel, as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, is subject to various market forces and trends. The Equal-Weight rating implies that the analyst perceives Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) performance to be in line with the broader market, neither overweight nor underweight.

We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide NVIDIA with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.', ' Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA ', ""In business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$2.39 to US$7.65 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?"", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of NVIDIA shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 26% to 46% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers."", 'Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NVIDIA.', ""We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$1.4t company like NVIDIA. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$55b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future."", ""NVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases."", 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

In its last earnings report on November 1, 2023, McKesson reported EPS of $6.23 versus consensus estimate of $6.11 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.83%."", 'For the current fiscal year, McKesson is expected to post earnings of $27.25 per share on $304.67 billion in revenues. This represents a 5.09% change in EPS on a 10.1% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $31.08 per share on $328.02 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.03% and 7.67%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'McKesson may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""McKesson has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 21.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.2X versus its peer group's average of 12.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.71. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', ""We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, McKesson currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts."", 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if McKesson fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though McKesson shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.', 'How Does MCK Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of MCK have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH). CAH has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. Cardinal Health, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 23.57%, and for the current fiscal year, CAH is expected to post earnings of $6.90 per share on revenue of $226.23 billion.', 'Shares of Cardinal Health, Inc. have gained 5.2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 15.41X and a P/CF of 12.25X.', 'The Medical - Dental Supplies industry may rank in the bottom 67% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MCK and CAH, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.', 'Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.', 'Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.', ""One company to watch right now is CNA Financial (CNA). CNA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 8.84, while its industry has an average P/E of 25.75. Over the past 52 weeks, CNA's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.90 and as low as 8.36, with a median of 8.97."", ""Investors should also note that CNA holds a PEG ratio of 1.77. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CNA's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.40. Over the past 52 weeks, CNA's PEG has been as high as 2.18 and as low as 1.67, with a median of 1.79."", ""Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CNA's P/B ratio of 1.34. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.49. Over the past 12 months, CNA's P/B has been as high as 1.38 and as low as 1.13, with a median of 1.25."", ""Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CNA has a P/S ratio of 0.89. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.12."", 'Another great Insurance - Property and Casualty stock you could consider is The Travelers Companies (TRV), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.', ""The Travelers Companies is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 11.53 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.13. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 25.75 and average PEG ratio of 2.40."", ""Over the past year, TRV's P/E has been as high as 17.36, as low as 10.11, with a median of 11.35; its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.39, as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.79 during the same time period."", ""Additionally, The Travelers Companies has a P/B ratio of 2.24 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.49. For TRV, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.24, as low as 1.67, with a median of 1.83 over the past year."", ""These are just a handful of the figures considered in CNA Financial and The Travelers Companies's great Value grade.

Nowadays, hydrogen is emerging as a popular alternative to diversifying the energy landscape. Consequently, for forward-looking investors, hydrogen stocks like Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG)\xa0seem like compelling opportunities.', ""But Plug Power is far from a wise investment. The company has continuously hemorrhaged cash for years, and it's still far from profitability. Instead, investors would do better to gas up their portfolios with other hydrogen names such as Air Products (NYSE: APD), Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), and Linde (NASDAQ: LIN)."", ""Specializing in the production and distribution of industrial gases, Air Products is making a concerted effort to expand its hydrogen power operations. In 2023, Air Products took a major step closer toward developing the world's largest green hydrogen (meaning no carbon emissions) production facility in Saudi Arabia after it completed financial arrangements for the $8.4 billion project. By 2026, Air Products expects the project to achieve daily hydrogen production of 600 metric tons."", 'Stateside, Air Products is partnering with AES to develop a $4 billion green hydrogen production facility in Texas. Expected to begin commercial operations in 2027, the Lone Star state facility will have a daily hydrogen production capacity of 200 metric tons, and it will be the largest facility of its type in the United States.', ""Unlike Plug Power, Air Products generates a massive amount of organic cash flow. This makes the stock a lot more appealing to conservative investors who are uncomfortable with Plug Power's consistent need to raise capital through both debt and equity financing. Plus, Air Products is a leading dividend stock, offering investors an attractive 2.7% dividend yield, so shareholders can be paid while Air Products grows its hydrogen footprint."", 'Bearing a more direct resemblance to Plug Power, Bloom Energy is also a leading fuel cell manufacturer. The two companies, however, contrast in a very important way: profitability. Bloom Energy has consistently generated a gross profit over the past five years. During this period, it averaged an annual gross profit of 16.2%. On the other hand, Plug Power has reported gross losses in 2021 and 2022, and its average annual gross profit is negative 109% from 2018 to 2022.', ""Further down the income statement, the difference between the two companies is even more apparent. During its third-quarter 2023 earnings presentation, Bloom Energy reaffirmed its forecast that it'd generated positive adjusted operating income for 2023. Plug Power hasn't provided any such guidance, and it's quite possible that it will fail to report a gross profit again for 2023."", 'Of course, the discussion between Bloom Energy and Plug Power in terms of profitability means little if Plug Power ends up going bankrupt -- an issue that management raised during its Q3 2023 earnings presentation when it stated its lack of confidence in the company\'s ""ability to continue as a going concern.""', 'Similar to Air Products, Linde is a leader in producing and distributing industrial gases, and it, too, has committed to advancing the development of the hydrogen economy.', ""Most recently, Linde expressed interest in partnering with Equinor to develop a blue hydrogen production facility in the Netherlands. The project is in the early stages of development, and financial details haven't been disclosed, but the facility is expected to have a daily production capacity of more than 575 metric tons."", ""With respect to the company's operations in the United States, Linde recently expanded hydrogen production at a facility in Alabama to 30 metric tons per day, and it's developing a blue hydrogen production facility in Texas that's slated to begin operations in 2025."", 'Financially, Linde is in a different league from Plug Power altogether -- namely concerning its cash flow. Linde is a free cash flow machine, generating gobs and gobs of organic cash.', ""Considering Plug Power's inability to generate even a semblance of organic cash flow, it's clear that Linde is a much more sound choice for risk-averse investors."", 'Plug Power may have a cult-like following, but its popularity belies the ample risk that surrounds the stock. Therefore, those who are eager to gain hydrogen exposure but would like to do so with a more judicious approach would be wise to power their portfolios with Air Products and Linde -- two industrial gas stalwarts that also offer steady passive income through their dividends.', 'Those who are interested in a more robust growth opportunity and are comfortable with a higher degree of risk, however, would be better served to choose Bloom Energy.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Plug Power wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The stock’s biggest drop, however, followed third-quarter earnings. Despite missing Wall Street’s expectations, sales and profits both rose, margins widened and it produced $733 million in free cash flow (FCF) during the first nine months of 2023.', 'It’s likely inflation and rising interest rates finally took a toll because the market remains favorable for GPC stock.

Foot traffic lagged, it settled for $5.7 billion in its role in the opioid crisis and its medical clinics underperformed.', 'That all weighed on Walgreens’ finances too leading to its bombshell announcement it was slashing its dividend nearly in half. The stock is now down 7% in 2024.', 'But don’t count the pharmacy chain out just yet. As painful as the dividend cut is, it was necessary to conserve cash. The stock just might be in a better position to grow throughout the rest of the year. I’m not expecting it to top the charts, but if it finally spins off its U.K.-based Boots pharmacy as planned, sheds the Beauty No7 brand and continues its cost-cutting plans, Walgreens could see shares grow again this year.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'The biggest loser in my portfolio was Orion Office REIT (NYSE:ONL), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates U.S. office properties.

As a REIT specializing in acquiring single-tenant net lease office properties, it relies heavily on debt to finance operations. That exposes the REIT to higher interest costs and credit risks, especially in a rising interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve ratcheted rates higher last year in an unprecedented series of spikes, impacting Orion’s finances.', 'Although the Fed hinted at possible rate cuts this year, there’s too much uncertainty now. Even so, rates won’t go appreciably lower to improve the REIT’s position. It does have a strong portfolio of properties in attractive markets, high occupancy rates and stable cash flows. The macroeconomic situation, however, may be too tough to fight. I expect Orion Office REIT to be a laggard once again this year.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for C.H. Robinson Worldwide, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.23 = US$626m ÷ (US$5.3b - US$2.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 12%."", ' View our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', ""In the above chart we have measured C.H. Robinson Worldwide's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for C.H. Robinson Worldwide."", ""Things have been pretty stable at C.H. Robinson Worldwide, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So it may not be a multi-bagger in the making, but given the decent 23% return on capital, it'd be difficult to find fault with the business's current operations. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that C.H. Robinson Worldwide has been paying out a decent 60% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders."", ""Another point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 50% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than23% because total capital employed would be higher.The 23% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 50% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. So with current liabilities at such high levels, this effectively means the likes of suppliers or short-term creditors are funding a meaningful part of the business, which in some instances can bring some risks."", ""While C.H. Robinson Worldwide has impressive profitability from its capital, it isn't increasing that amount of capital. And with the stock having returned a mere 11% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", ""On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for C.H.

The proposed multi-year rate plan lacks appropriate incentives for Pepco to contain its costs or protect its customers from unreasonable rates, according to Lane.', 'The opposition to Pepco’s proposal resembles emerging concerns from some utility regulators about rising electric rates, in some cases driven by the energy transition, according to Paul Patterson, an equity analyst for Glenrock Associates. “We’re beginning to see — in certain jurisdictions — regulatory pushback,” he said.', 'The issue centers on Pepco’s April proposal to raise its overall electric rates in Washington, D.C., by roughly 6% a year for three years starting this year for a total revenue increase of about $190 million. The proposal includes a 10.5% return on equity and will help meet the district’s clean energy goals, according to the Exelon utility.', 'However, the D.C. government, the Office of the People’s Counsel for the District of Columbia and the Apartment and Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington, called AOBA, oppose key elements of Pepco’s proposal.', 'Synapse’s Lane told the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia that Pepco’s proposal fails to adequately advance the district’s goals around grid modernization, increased distributed energy resources and non-wires alternatives.', 'Pepco has an existing pilot multi-year rate plan, but it hasn’t been adequately assessed, according to Lane. The PSC should continue historical test year ratemaking until an evaluation framework is developed for how to track and assess the benefits of a multi-year rate plan, Lane said.\xa0', 'The ratepayer advocate’s office said the PSC should reject Pepco’s multi-year rate proposal “There is no evidence to support a finding that the company’s [multi-year rate plan] pilot provided any net public benefits or was in the public interest,” the office said.', 'Generally, multi-year rate plans, which are based on expected utility spending, benefit utilities and their shareholders through predictable rates and reduced regulatory lag for cost recovery, but haven’t been shown to be helpful to consumers, according to the ratepayer’s office. In contrast, historical test-year ratemaking bases a utility’s rates on its actual expenses from a single past year.', 'About 90% of the projects in Pepco’s “climate ready grid” modernization initiative are routine reliability projects that any prudent utility would make, and some of those projects could be delayed or eliminated without hurting the district’s climate goals, the ratepayer’s office said.', 'With Pepco facing flat or declining electricity sales, the PSC should rein in the utility’s spending, according to AOBA. “In the context of declining kWh and kW billing units, as well as only modest increases in the numbers of customers served, maintenance of the affordability of electric service in the District necessitates more rigorous efforts to trim Pepco’s planned rate base growth to reflect only essential expenditures,” the trade group said.', 'Glenrock’s Patterson cited several recent rate decisions as signs that some regulators may be concerned about how much consumers pay for electricity. They include:', 'The early January decision by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission to approve a $15.3 million rate hike, with a 9.26% return on equity, for Public Service Co. of New Mexico, down from a requested $63.8 million increase with a 10.25% ROE;', 'December decisions by the Illinois Commerce Commission authorizing a $506 million revenue increase over four years for Exelon’s Commonwealth Edison subsidiary, down from its $1.5 billion request, and a $58 million hike for Ameren Illinois, which asked for $448 million over four years; and', 'In August, Connecticut regulators slashed United Illuminating Co.’s, or UI’s,\xa0proposed rate hike to $23 million from $131 million while earlier in the year shifted to a performance-based regulation framework for UI, an Avangrid subsidiary, and Connecticut Light & Power, owned by Eversource Energy.', 'Regulatory pushback on rising rates will occur jurisdiction by jurisdiction, Patterson said, noting that states such as California and New York have been generally supportive of utility spending proposals that bolster the energy transition. Maryland regulators last month approved a multi-year rate plan for Exelon’s Baltimore Gas and Electric subsidiary, he noted.', 'It may be easy to support programs that bolster state policy goals, but ultimately someone must pay for them, according to Patterson. “It’s one thing to order off the menu. It’s another to pay for it,” he said.', 'Further, in recent years, reduced natural gas prices, a key factor in setting electricity prices, has buffered consumer bills from some utility spending, Patterson said. However, growing liquefied natural gas exports may contribute to overall higher gas prices in coming years, he said.', 'This story was originally published on Utility Dive.

Accrdoing to Bloomberg, this development has raised speculations that the Federal Reserve may not be quick to implement interest rate cuts, given the apparent resilience of the economy. The likelihood of a March interest-rate cut, as indicated by Fed swaps, has now been trimmed to approximately 50%, reflecting a shift in market expectations. The surge in US retail sales, reported as the highest in three months, further intensified concerns among investors. The robust reading on retail sales triggered apprehensions about the efficacy of Wall Street's assertive dovish stance, especially in the context of favorable economic data. Central bank officials, adopting a more cautious tone regarding potential easing measures, added to the apprehension among traders. This cautious stance has created an environment where market participants are now readjusting their expectations, delaying the anticipated timing of the first Fed move. As a result, the odds of a rate reduction in the first quarter have been revised downward. The comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde underscore the concerns about aggressive market bets on interest-rate cuts. Lagarde emphasized that such speculative behavior in financial markets may not be conducive to policymakers' efforts and their ability to effectively manage economic challenges."", 'Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has commanded considerable attention at the World Economic Forum, drawing interest from major tech players like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google. In 2024, the spotlight has shifted to a more nuanced exploration of generative AI, with a specific emphasis on advancing the accuracy of AI results. This evolution is deemed critical for fostering confidence, particularly in high-stakes industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has emerged as a key advocate for this refinement, asserting that the next phase of AI development involves incorporating formal correctness into the underlying models. In an interview with CNBC, Gelsinger underscores the need for precision, especially in domains like medicine, manufacturing, and autonomous driving, where accuracy is paramount. Interviews with Gelsinger and Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, reveal a shared commitment to experimentation and co-piloting tests as instrumental strategies for improving accuracy and encouraging wider adoption of AI technologies. Shih introduces a pragmatic three-phase approach for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) adoption, which begins with assisting work, progresses to ensuring accuracy in autopilot mode, and ultimately leads to trusting the technology at chosen confidence levels. This phased approach aligns with the broader goal of making AGI more approachable and less intimidating, emphasizing the crucial role of human acceptance.

The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role.

Moreover, PSA’s technological advancements and healthy balance sheet are commendable. Its sustainable dividend payouts make it an attractive investment option. However, weak demand in a soft macroeconomic environment, a rise in move-out activities, a development boom in many markets and elevated interest rates remain concerns.', ""Public Storage is one of the top owners and operators of storage facilities. The brand stands out as one of the most recognized and established names in the self-storage industry. With a significant market presence in major metropolitan centers, the company is poised to capitalize on the economies of scale, apart from benefiting from its brand recognition. The company is leveraging technology for revenue optimization and cost efficiencies and, as such, has invested in technologies over the past few years.In addition, Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In September 2023, it acquired Simply Self Storage from BREIT for $2.2 billion. From the beginning of 2021 through Sep 30, 2023, the company acquired 459 facilities with 38 million net rentable square feet for $8.3 billion.Following Sep 30, 2023, the company has either acquired or was under contract to acquire 11 self-storage facilities across eight states with 0.8 million net rentable square feet for $170.3 million. It also has a pipeline of nearly $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next two years. With solid access to capital, the company is well-poised to take advantage of a potential opportunity.Public Storage maintains a strong financial profile characterized by solid credit metrics, including low leverage relative to its total capitalization and operating cash flows. The net debt and preferred equity to EBITDA was 3.9X in the third quarter of 2023, and the EBITDA to fixed-charge coverage was 8.9 times as of the same date. Its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market. With solid access to capital, the company is well-poised to take advantage of any potential expansion opportunity.Public Storage’s current cash flow growth is projected at 96.40% compared with the 8.17% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. Public Storage’s ROE is 34.76% compared with the industry’s average of 3.08%.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for investment in REIT stocks. Public Storage has consistently paid its dividends and continued with its payments even during the pandemic. In February 2023, it announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend from $2 per share to $3. This marked a hike of 50% in its dividend payment. The annualized common dividend payment now equates to $12 per share.Moreover, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we anticipate core funds from operations (FFO) to increase 5.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2023. Looking at the company’s core FFO growth projections and financial position compared to that of the industry’s average, its current dividend is expected to be sustainable in the upcoming period.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 2% over the past month, outperforming its industry's growth of 0.1%. Analysts seem bullish regarding PSA’s FFO growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 and 2024 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past month."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'With tenants reverting to more normal move-out behavior as the pandemic’s impact abates, there is upward pressure on vacate trends. This is likely to limit rental rate growth in many markets. In fact, the demand is likely to remain tempered amid a soft macroeconomic outlook and more limited home-moving activities, with move-out activities and occupancy levels returning to pre-2020 levels.To lure tenants in such a challenging environment, management continues to focus on lowering rental rates to new customers and increasing promotional discounting. Consequently, same-store revenues are likely to be affected, and we estimate a 3.1% decline in this metric in the fourth quarter. Also, we project 2023 weighted average square foot occupancy to be 93.1%, down from 94.9% recorded at the end of 2022.A high interest rate is a concern for Public Storage. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden, and its total debt as of Sep 30, 2023, was approximately $9.1 billion.

With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim."", ""Tim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. I'd like to start our call by recognizing and thanking our team for the incredible effort given over 2023. While it was a turbulent year in many ways, we ended it by delivering nearly 11% earnings growth and driving our 12-year earnings CAGR since merger to 10.3%. We deployed over $7 billion into new investments, raised nearly $2 billion of strategic capital in a very challenging environment and delivered excellent operating results while serving and growing customer relationships. We're also appreciative of the opportunity we had at our Investor Forum last month to share our vision and outlook for the company over the coming years. The environment is setting up in line or better than our expectations with development starts across the market continuing to decline by two-thirds from peak and an improvement in customer sentiment that appears more constructive than just 90 days ago."", ""That said, we still see challenges in some submarkets as near-term outsized deliveries are met with still recovering demand. But our thesis remains the same as we've been describing for over a year and detailed last month in New York, which is that the supply cliff will converge with normalized demand later this year, delivering an environment conducive to strong market rent growth. We believe that annual market rent growth will average between 4% and 6% over the next three years, with 2024 being modestly positive and ramping thereafter. Turning to our results. We finished the year strong with quarterly core FFO, excluding promotes of $1.29 per share, bringing the full year to the top end of our guidance $5.10 per share. While market occupancy declined by approximately 100 basis points, our portfolio gained 10 basis points to end the year at 97.6%."", 'Net effective rent change over the quarter was 74%, bringing the full year to a record of 77%, with another impressive results out of Southern California at over 150%, a reminder that it remains the strongest market for cash flow growth despite near-term choppiness given the large quantum of its lease mark-to-market. In the end, same-store on a net effective basis was 7.8%, while cash was 8.5%. We started over $2 billion of new developments in the quarter across 46 projects in 27 markets with nearly 50% of the activity in build-to-suit. In Energy and as seen in our new supplemental disclosure, we stand at year end with approximately 515 megawatts of solar and storage in operation with an additional 70 currently under construction. We had a quiet quarter on the financing front, raising approximately $300 million, but our full year of activity closed out at over $12 billion at a weighted average rate of 4.5% and term of 10 years.', 'Our total debt portfolio remains at an overall in-place rate of just 3% with more than nine years of average remaining life. Turning to market conditions. The increase in fourth quarter market vacancy was in line with our expectations and driven by demand that remained moderate as customers exercised caution in their spending, while completions hit an all-time high. Development starts, however, have continued to fall across the U.S. and Europe, extending and deepening the future supply shortfall. On the ground, our teams are seeing revived customer interest with healthy showing activity to start the year. This includes build-to-suit inquiries, which we expect to remain active for Prologis following a strong year in 2023. Our proprietary metrics point to normal levels of activity with proposals and gestation timing in line or a bit better than historical norms.', ""Utilization declined in the quarter to approximately 83% and keeping with this morning's report a decrease in the inventory to sales ratio. We view this positively because utilization also increased from here as stronger than expected retail sales over the fourth quarter and holiday season drove lower inventories, which will need to be replenished. Turning to market rents. Our global view is that rents declined this quarter by 90 basis points, but predominantly impacted by an estimated 7% decline in Southern California. Our full year view is that global market rents grew by 6%, just below our expectations, ultimately driving our lease mark-to-market to end the quarter at 57% after capturing approximately $100 million in realized NOI growth from leases rolling up to market."", 'The outlier on rent growth is clearly Southern California. While our portfolio was only 2.6% vacant at year end, growing availability has made leasing very competitive. Combined with a 110% increase in rents since 2020, the rent retracement is understandable. Historically, there has never been a market where the delta between expiring and market rents has been so large that it provides ample room for property owners to deviate from market in order to attract customers. But looking ahead, the positive news is that we are launching two trends reverse. The first is that the supply pipeline is clearly emptying with little in the way of new starts. And the second is that the escalating issues in both the Suez and Panama canals together with the resolution of the West Coast labor negotiations are moving shipment volumes back to the West.', 'While this bodes well for SoCal and still early, we are watching East Coast port markets more closely. In any event, all of these disruptions are reiterating the underlying need for resiliency and the just in case approach to inventories. Summing this all up globally, we recognize the high volume of near term deliveries that need to be absorbed into our markets over the next few quarters. But we are very pleased with our ability thus far to build occupancy, drive rents, and illustrate more differentiation in our portfolio as market vacancy grows. As for Strategic Capital and Valuations, we saw U.S. values decline approximately 5.5% during the quarter, which was our expectation and the reason we paused our appraisal based activity, which includes calling and redeeming capital as well as asset contributions.', ""We run an industry leading franchise in which we aim to set the standard for governance, including timely, accurate, and independent valuations. Calling out when pronounced lags and valuations emerge has protected investors and demonstrated how we stand apart as a responsible partner. With this quarter's value declines in a more stabilized rate environment, we'll resume activity in USLF including the funding of our $250 million commitment announced in the second half of '23. Turning to guidance and all at our share. In terms of operating metrics, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5% with occupancy likely to step down in the first quarter and rebuild over the course of the year. Cash same-store will range between 8% and 9% and net effective same-store growth will range from 7% to 8%."", 'We are forecasting net G&A to range between $420 million and $440 million and Strategic Capital income to range from $530 million to $550 million. We have a very big year of stabilization activity ahead of us with a range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, and expected yields of approximately 6.25%. On the new deployment front, we are guiding development starts to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion with the estimated build to suit mix of 40%. And we plan to take sale portfolios to the market over the year with expected proceeds to range between $800 million and $1.2 billion and additionally forecast $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion in contributions to our Strategic Capital vehicles. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.20 and $3.45 per share.', 'Core FFO excluding promotes will range from $5.50 to $5.64 per share, while core FFO including net promote expense will range between $5.42 and $5.56 per share, each a bit higher than our preliminary guidance at the Investor Forum. While we do not forecast any promote revenue at this time, there are some small opportunities that do exist in FIBRA Prologis and our new PJLF vehicle in Japan. In closing, we know that the market is not yet out of the woods with regards to incoming supply, but the combination of a stronger backdrop continued low level of starts and a calmer capital markets environment has us optimistic that 2024 will be another great year. As you know from our Investor Day, we have many initiatives in flight designed to add value beyond our real estate and because of our real estate.', ""We look forward to continuing to execute on our plan and providing you updates throughout the year. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to get ahead of questions which have grown a little more frequent in recent quarters surrounding market rent growth. Unintentionally, we set an expectation that we could forecast market rents to a single point of accuracy in increasingly short time periods, and honestly, we're just not that good. We've gotten away from a practice that was originally aimed at being high level and directional. So what we've elected to do in order to help investors without perpetuating the issue is to simply provide high level rent growth expectations on a rolling 12 month forward view. As mentioned earlier, in terms of our three year CAGR of 4% to 6%, we believe we'll see modestly positive rent growth aligned with inflation over the next 12 months and we'll continue to update this rolling view on our future calls."", 'With that, we will now take your questions.

You may begin.', 'Jill Sawyer', ""Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim."", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""Thanks, Jill. I'd like to start our call by recognizing and thanking our team for the incredible effort given over 2023. While it was a turbulent year in many ways, we ended it by delivering nearly 11% earnings growth and driving our 12-year earnings CAGR since merger to 10.3%. We deployed over $7 billion into new investments, raised nearly $2 billion of strategic capital in very challenging environment and delivered excellent operating results while serving and growing customer relationships. We're also appreciative of the opportunity we had at our Investor Forum last month to share our vision and outlook for the company over the coming years. The environment is setting up in line or better than our expectations with development starts across the market continuing to decline by 2/3 from peak and an improvement in customer sentiment that appears more constructive than just 90 days ago.That said, we still see challenges in some submarkets as near-term outsized deliveries are met with still recovering demand. But our thesis remains the same as we've been describing for over a year and detailed last month in New York, which is that the supply cliff will converge with normalized demand later this year, delivering an environment conducive to strong market rent growth. We believe that annual market rent growth will average between 4% and 6% over the next 3 years, with 2024 being modestly positive and ramping thereafter. Turning to our results. We finished the year strong with quarterly core FFO, excluding promotes, of $1.29 per share, bringing the full year to the top end of our guidance of $5.10 per share. While market occupancy declined by approximately 100 basis points, our portfolio gained 10 basis points to end the year at 97.6%. Net effective rent change over the quarter was 74%, bringing the full year to a record of 77%, with another impressive results out of Southern California at over 150% a reminder that it remains the strongest market for cash flow growth despite near-term choppiness given the large quantum of this lease mark-to-market. In the end, same-store on a net effective basis was 7.8%, while cash was 8.5%. We started over $2 billion of new developments in the quarter across 46 projects in 27 markets with nearly 50% of the activity in build-to-suits. In energy, and as seen in our new supplement disclosure, we stand at year-end with approximately 515 megawatts of solar and storage in operation with an additional 70 currently under construction. We had a quiet quarter on the financing front, raising approximately $300 million, but our full year of activity closed out at over $12 billion at a weighted average rate of 4.5% in term of 10 years. Our total debt portfolio remains at an overall in-place rate of just 3% with more than 9 years of average remaining life. Turning to market conditions. The increase in fourth quarter market vacancy was in line with our expectations and driven by demand that remain moderate as customers exercise caution in their spending, while completions hit an all-time high. Development starts, however, have continued to fall across the U.S. and Europe, extending and deepening the future supply shortfall. On the ground, our teams are seeing revised customer interest with healthy showing activity to start the year. This includes build-to-suit inquiries, which we expect to remain active for Prologis following a strong year in 2023. Our proprietary metrics point to normal levels of activity with proposals and gestation timing in line or a bit better than historical norms. Utilization declined in the quarter to approximately 83% in keeping with this morning's reported decrease in the inventory to sales ratio. We view this positively because utilization ought to increase from here as stronger-than-expected retail sales over the fourth quarter and holiday season drove lower inventories, which will need to be replenished. Turning to market rents. Our global view is that rents declined this quarter by 90 basis points, but predominantly impacted by an estimated 7% decline in Southern California. Our full year view is that global market rents grew by 6%, just below our expectations, ultimately driving our lease mark-to-market to end the quarter at 57% after capturing approximately $100 million in realized NOI growth from leases rolling up to market. The outlier on rent growth is clearly Southern California. While our portfolio was only 2.6% vacant at year-end, growing availability has made leasing very competitive. Combined with a 110% increase in rent since 2020, the rent retracement is understandable. Historically, there has never been a market where the delta between expiring and market rents has been so large that it provides ample room for property owners to deviate for market in order to attract customers. So looking ahead, the positive news is that we are watching 2 trends reverse. The first is that the supply pipeline is clearly emptying with little in the way of new starts. And the second is that the escalating issues in both the Suez and Panama Canals together with the resolution of the West Coast labor negotiations are moving shipment volumes back to the West. While this bodes well for SoCal and still early, we are watching East Coast port markets more closely. In any event, all of these disruptions are reiterating the underlying need for resiliency and the just-in-case approach to inventories.

Turning to guidance in all of our share, in terms of operating metrics, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, with occupancy likely to step down in the first quarter and rebuild over the course of the year. Cash same-store will range between 8% and 9% and net effective same-store growth will range from 7% to 8%.

We have a very big year of stabilization activity ahead of us with a range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion and expected yields f approximately 6.25%.

Each a bit higher than our preliminary guidance at the investor forum. While we do not forecast any promote revenue at this time, there are some small opportunities that do exist in [fee] for Prologis in our new PJLF vehicle in Japan.

As mentioned earlier, in terms of our 3-year CAGR of 4% to 6%, we believe we'll see modestly positive rent growth aligned with inflation over the next 12 months, and we'll continue to update this rolling view on our future calls. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG.', 'William Thomas Catherwood', ""Excellent. Kind of maybe taking a look at your leasing spreads. Obviously, very strong performance during the quarter, but also a big spread between Prologis share and the kind of overall portfolio performance, which suggests stronger performance out of the U.S. Going forward into '24, are you expecting this gap in performance to tighten at all? Or should the U.S. continue to lead the way as far as spreads go this year?"", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""I'll take that. I think, Tom, that it will actually be relatively similar. There's a pretty long tail on how the lease mark-to-market is going to affect quarterly rent change, it will sustain for quite a while in other words. And since it's much more pronounced in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world, I would expect we do see that continue to stay wide."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Just 2 quick ones for me. So one, we've been looking at a lot of the broker reports talking about rising availability rates. You guys have flagged it as well. So just curious what you guys are seeing in sort of the Sun Belt markets versus sort of the coastal and if that's trending sort of in line or with your expectation and so forth would be the first."", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""Hey, it's Chris Caton. I'll take that. So the year is -- or the year closed out with market vacancy rates mid-5%, just like Tim described. And the vacancy rates remain lower on the coast -- excuse me, so both East Coast and West Coast and higher in the Sunbelt. What we are seeing as it relates to pricing is there was better pricing, better rent growth in the Sunbelt markets outperforming the coast in 2023."", 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Great. And if I could just follow-up on the market rent growth comment. I think you said rolling 12 months sort of inflationary plus or minus. So clearly, that's implying sort of an acceleration in '25 and '26 as supply comes down. Is that sort of how you guys are thinking about it?"", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""That's exactly right."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi.', 'Craig Allen Mailman', ""Great. Two quick ones here. I guess first question would be, could you guys just go through what the uptick in property improvements in the CapEx section were there's a pretty big jump in 4Q versus prior quarters. And then just second, Tim, you had kind of touched on this that tenant sentiment is improving here and there may be better traffic going back to the West Coast with everything going in the Red Sea and the realization that just in case maybe a more prudent inventory method. But I'm just kind of curious because big tenant leasing has been kind of slower over the last 12 to 18 months. Are you seeing any early green shoots on that improving as you guys are talking with customers?"", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""Yes, I'll take the first part here, Craig, on the CapEx. If you take a look at the supplemental, I'd first start by widening out on overall CapEx before staring at property improvements. And there's just a good example here of the need to look at annual or trailing numbers as this can be a pretty volatile number quarterly. Here, you can see on the full year as a percentage of our NOI, we are about 14%, roughly 15% the prior year. And yes, focusing in on property improvements, I'd suggest the same that you have to look at a trailing basis. We do tend to see higher levels of property improvement activity in the fourth quarter just by nature, but we're catching up on the full year. You can see we averaged $0.12 on the year versus the $0.21 that we had in the quarter. So that's really just a timing issue. One more thing that you can see here is the year-over-year average on that basis $0.12 versus the prior year 10. And I'd explain that differential as just some inflationary piece and then the second would be some deferred maintenance and work that we're executing on the Duke portfolio."", 'Daniel Stephen Letter', ""And maybe this is Dan, Craig. On that second part of your question related to tenant sentiment, I would say, at the Investor Day, we had talked about a marginally better tenant sentiment from the Q3 earnings call. And I would say it's even marginally better than that in the last 30 days. This is fueled by our healthy proposal volumes, customer dialogues have been strong, 45% of our available space is in discussion right now with active proposals. We've anecdotally had just a number of conversations with our customer-led solutions group. Our build-to-suit conversations are improving as well. Our overall build-to-suit pipeline has grown quarter-over-quarter. So whether that be some of the issues related to the Red Sea issues and the canal issues or not. I think Chris will have some comments on that."", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""Yeah. I'll just go further, Craig, as it relates to port activity. We went out on a limb in September with a published research report calling for recovery in market share, and that is really, really playing out in the port activities. In November, West Coast ports were up 24% year-on-year. Inbound shipments are up even more, and that will translate to leasing over time."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.', 'Caitlin Burrows', ""Tim, earlier, you mentioned how development starts are down, maybe 2/3 from the peak and that you're seeing little in terms of new starts broadly. When we look at your own build-to-suit split of development, it is up year-over-year and then that earlier question just on customer sentiment. So I guess, combining all of those pieces, how do you think that impacts your decision to do spec development versus build-to-suit over the course of this year?"", 'Daniel Stephen Letter', ""Caitlin, this is Dan. I'll respond here. A few thoughts for you. First of all, we started just over $1 billion worth of spec in the fourth quarter. So we had talked over the last several quarters about the declining starts in the marketplace, and that's when we wanted to come out of the gate here with some starts, and that's what you're seeing us do right now. We have a pretty healthy guidance here for 2024 starts at owned and managed of about $4 billion. And if you think about it, that's 25 million square feet or so of starts that we could be doing this year. And we have a development portfolio right now of about 50 million square feet. So we've got an appetite for spec. Our build-to-suit volume, we think, is going to shake out in that 40% range as we've projected. And then keep in mind, we talked about this plenty at the Investor Day. We have $40 billion worth of opportunities in our land bank and we have the ability to make decisions on a quarterly basis, where we're going to build. We own this land in [50] markets around the globe, 300 different sites. So plenty of opportunities there."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""I just wanted to touch on the development start guidance of $3 billion plus this year. Can you just help us break that down versus -- and so traditional industrial versus like data centers or other property types? And does the pre-lease percentage that you're expecting differ a whole lot? And sorry, to add a third year. Typically, how long will the data center development is paid to cash flow?"", 'Daniel Stephen Letter', ""Sure, Ki Bin, this is Dan. I'll hit that. First of all, we gave some guidance on our data center business 30 days ago at Investor Day. We talked about over the next 5 years, 20-or-so opportunities, 3 gigawatts of data centers, $7 billion to $8 billion worth of investment. Those numbers have not changed. As a matter of fact, one thing we couldn't disclose at Investor Day was we started over $500 million worth of data centers in the fourth quarter alone. You won't see us guide to data centers. These are very lumpy deals. And if you think about our data center opportunities, we own over 5,500 buildings. We own or control over 12,000 acres globally. So we have one of the most important components of data centers. We control the land, right? We talked about power applications at Investor Day. We talked about a number below 50. That number is now approaching 60. Our team is very active growing that data center pipeline. Then the third component of it would be customers, and we're talking to the big hyperscalers on a regular basis. And we think it's prudent for us to be careful on how we project out what our data center volume will be because there's a competitive nature to this as well. We're negotiating with these customers, and we think it's important for us we will absolutely share with you, when these projects are on the horizon. But right now, our start volume is largely industrial. And then keep in mind, our data center business is a part of our long higher and better use business. We're going to build. We're going to merchant build these, and we're going to recycle that capital into the business we love so much, which is logistics."", 'William Thomas Catherwood', ""Yes. To your question about how long it will take them to cash flow, if there's a wider range than traditional industrial. But I would say on kind of powered shelves, it's more in the 12- to 15-month range from start and on turnkey depending on who does it and whether the customer does it or we do it, it could be a longer than that by about a year because since the installations are pretty complicated to get these going. But all of that is built into the budget and the economics of the transaction. And this point that then made on the negotiating posture is really important. I mean the last thing we want to do, there are 4 or 5 customers out there, and it's pretty obvious given the scale of the numbers, they can figure out, which project is in our guidance for the next quarter, if we wanted to go in that direction, and that basically reduces our leverage. So we're just not going to do that."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Jay Poskitt with Evercore ISI.', 'James Poskitt', ""I was wondering, if you could just provide a little bit of commentary on the supply and demand trends over the next couple of quarters? You've previously said that you think deliveries will outpace demand for over the next couple of quarters and then the inverse will happen after that. So just any update on that would be great."", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""Jay, it's Chris Caton. So we project 250 million square feet of net absorption in the calendar year and 285 million square feet of completions. And yes, that's going to be front-end loaded, particularly on the supply side. And so we think you'll see the vacancy rate rise by another 50 to 75 basis points here in the first half of the year, peaking at 6%, maybe 6.1% and then making a meaningful move through the subsequent rest of the year and into 2025 and 2026 based on the trend in starts that we've profiled for you."", 'William Thomas Catherwood', ""Let me just punctuate that. Vacancy rates will go up through the second quarter. So don't be surprised by that. But we're pretty confident they'll come back down after that."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank.', 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""I just wanted to go back to the space utilization comment you made, Tim, about feeling that at this point, retailers likely have to restock inventories is actually good sign, where of space utilization is. I guess I'm wondering if you could give us some -- remind us sort of seasonally how this may play out historically in terms of leasing demand picking up from 3PL or retailers because of that issue of restocking? And then as well in terms of the lease proposals picking up in the fourth quarter, if you had any benefit already from that industry or even anecdotally, you could talk a little bit about the discussions there."", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""Yes. So the easy way of thinking about this is basically absorption and demand for our product follows 1, 2, 3, 4 scenario as you move through the quarters. It's back-end loaded towards the fourth quarter. And that's historically been the relationship. Because so much of the activity occurs in the fourth quarter and so much of that activity would have been based on anticipation earlier in terms of the Christmas season, so much of the sales are in the Christmas season. The volatility is the most in the fourth quarter. This year, retail sales and in particular, e-com sales were better than people's expectations and the retailers were caught short in '21. They were a little overstocked in '22. And now they were back to being very careful with inventories. So they got caught short of inventories again. That's why utilization is done. They're schizophrenic. They always have too much or too little. You can never get it right. And the good news is that this Christmas season was stronger than everybody anticipated. It's going to take for that to work its way back to normal."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.', 'Blaine Matthew Heck', 'Can you just talk broadly about valuation and cap rates? And given the continued movement in the 10-year, I guess, do you think that pricing is adjusted correctly? Or could we see continued volatility in the near term -- I guess that potential volatility present you with any investment opportunities?', 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""Yes. We don't think the real pricing and real returns have really changed because return expectations should have been higher 6 months ago because of higher treasury rates. But nobody was trading based on those higher return requirements. So nothing really happened. So it was a theoretical decline in values. I think with the treasuries now having come down, I know they've gone up a little bit just most recently, but net-net, they're down. I think the reality is the expectations of the market participants and that theoretical pricing of assets is converging. Bottom line, we think we're seeing the near bottom of valuations, both in the U.S. and Europe. And I think with this level of stability and sort of bottom forming, you'll see more volume coming through in terms of real deals."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""Another supply-demand question. But just as we think about the cliff of new deliveries coming online, it sounds like that drops off in the second quarter. Is there an extended period of time, where we're going to need to lease these up. And so the inflection of when supply gets better and then combined with what you're seeing on the demand side? Does that mean -- does that happen through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? Or is that kind of happen just as soon as the deliveries slow?"", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""It's Chris. So I'll start off by offering. Look, the vacancy rate is going to go up to 6% -- Hamid and I are very clear, well the whole team is clear on that. Bear in mind, that's a very low level in the context of history. And so yes, it will take -- there'll be time for vacancy to decline to soak up that availability. But it's going from a low level to an even lower level. So it's a bit like they can see it's going to go from 6%, it's going to move to 5.5% and likely to 5%, given the supply cliff that we see."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America.', 'Jing Xian Tan Bonnel', 'Your outlook for development stabilizations is quite positive despite the supply environment remaining elevated for the first half of this year. So could you just expand on what the expected timing is around for this? And then, if you can just follow-up a little bit more on your comments around tenant inventory. What are they telling you in terms of how they plan to adapt to any persisting disruption around East coast ports?', 'Daniel Stephen Letter', ""Camille, this is Dan. I'll start with your question on stabilization. It is a big year on stabilizations for us. We actually started the year out with some good news. Late December, we actually pulled in for stabilizations that we had expected to happen in the first quarter of 2024. But overall, the timing of those stabilizations, it spread out pretty well throughout the year. And one number I would just point to is that 2024 stabilization, volume is 46% leased already, which is actually 300, 400 basis points above the average at this point over the last several years."", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""Camille, it's Chris. I want to jump in on the disruption of the ports. We're really just now seeing the diversions as it relates to the disruptions in both Panama and the Red Sea and Suez and so it's a bit early for us to see real medium-term leasing decisions in response to these disruptions. But number one is the clarification or the ratification of the labor agreement on the West Coast is providing a clear landscape for decision-making and the engines of growth are beginning to kick in Southern California."", 'William Thomas Catherwood', ""Let me make that point a little stronger. I think all this concern about L.A. is over. And it hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but it will in the next 6 months. So I don't think we'll be sitting here on calls like this worrying about L.A. and its absorption. Now will we worry about something else? I'm sure we will. I don't know whether that's going to be the East Coast or Houston or whatever. But yes, I mean, you've seen 2 big movements. It's not just Suez. It's also a Panama Canal and the water issues there and the expense of shipping stuff through the canal is leading to more reversion back to the normal way of doing it, which is getting it to a land and land verging it over. But there could be other disruptions. It could be something can blow up in the Persian Gulf. So it's very hard to predict those things. The big message is this, we can spend a lot of time guessing as to what the share of West Coast is, East Coast is all of that. The point is people thought COVID was the big unknown factor. And now that COVID is over, the world is going to go back to a stable, predictable just-in-time type of inventory strategy. I think each one of these things, whether it's Panama, whether it's Suez, whether it's or in the Middle East, whether it's something in the Persian Gulf, we'll remind people that they generally need to have a more conservative inventory strategy. And that's the big long-term driver, which is going to be a tailwind for demand that we haven't really seen play out just yet. We're pretty confident that will."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', 'Do your comments about seeing revived customer interest apply to big box leasing as well?', 'William Thomas Catherwood', ""Yes. In fact, I would say some of the largest customers that we talk to are -- use an overused word, there are definitely some green shoots. There [posterous] is changing from that of let's hold off, and they've held up as long as they can because they're building out their networks, particularly on the e-comm side. And I think given that the economy hasn't tanked, like everybody thought it would 1.5 years ago, I think they're tip toeing out there. And with the first couple doing it, I think the rest will follow. So I think, yes, the big box guys are coming out of the shadows and taking up some space again."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.', 'John P. Kim', ""On your commentary on Southern California coming -- rents coming down 7%. Can you give the same color on New York, New Jersey, that's a market you've seen a larger decline sequentially in occupancy and now you're discussing issues with port volumes and the canals?"", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""We are not going to get into quarterly rent forecast, and we're not going to get into market-by-market forecast. We run a 1.2 billion square foot business, and I think we are ready in terms of a company of our size and disclosure and details are definitely in the 99th percentile, and we just don't have that ability, so we're not going to put some numbers out there that we can't be certain of. So if you don't mind, just let's stay away from that fine level of dissection beyond our ability."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird.', 'Nicholas Patrick Thillman', ""You guys touched a little bit on (technical difficulty) at your investor forum, you kind of mentioned that you expected ex-U.S. to outperform U.S. in a market rent growth standpoint. Is still -- is that still the case? And then maybe could you just highlight some markets that you're a little bit more incrementally positive on over the last 30 days of activity?"", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""It's Chris. Yes, indeed, we saw International outperformed in the fourth quarter, our view is that it will outperform in 2024. And there are a wide range of international markets that are enjoying really strong market rent growth. Latin America, both Brazil and Mexico, turning to Europe, probably Northern Europe is the strongest. And then here in North America, Toronto is a market that's also enjoying outsized growth."", 'Hamid R. Moghadam', 'Yes, U.K. is outperforming, too.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.', 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""Just 2 quick ones. So just first of all, going back, Chris, I guess, to your comment around $250 million in demand, if I heard that correctly, in '24. Can you just give us what's the actual number in '23, you're comparing that to? And with your leading indicators, just how long does the -- do the leading indicator sort of take in terms of conversion to leases. So that's just the first one to understand the comparison and the trajectory. And then second, do you mind just giving us some specifics on what you're baking in for numbers for cash rent spreads and where portfolio mark-to-market is?"", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""It's Chris. Thanks for the question, Vikram. I'll take the first one. So 250 million square feet of net absorption in 2024 compared to 192 million square feet of net absorption in 2023. And we will consult a wide range of leading indicators, some of which are contemporary and some that have a 9- to 12-month lease."", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""Vikram, on the lease mark-to-market, I'll just say again, I don't particularly value the cash view of the lease mark-to-market, I think it's fraught with a few issues. But to answer the question, we saw it at 49% at the end of the year. And I would expect, we've seen a pretty wide divergence in cash to net effective rent spreads because of a few things. The absolute level of rents has been so high and the bumps have been pretty large around 4%, as you've known. So the roughly -- due to [factory] as well, of course. So the roughly 20, 25 points that we've been seeing lately, I expect we'll see mostly continue into next year."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Todd Michael Thomas', ""Just wanted to ask about capital deployment, 2 questions actually. First, can you talk a little bit more about the acquisition pipeline today and whether you are seeing an increase in seller interest to transact more deals coming to market and more product hitting the market? And then second, the spread between stabilized yields and cap rates for both development stabilizations and new starts narrowed in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that trend in spreads and what we might expect in '24 particularly as you move forward, just given the mix of build-to-suits and spec developments and some of the higher better use projects that you're ramping up on."", 'Daniel Stephen Letter', ""Todd,, this is Dan. I'll respond to your questions here. First of all, yes is the quick answer to your first part of the question regarding the acquisition pipeline. Our teams are out there turning over every stone. It was a low volume year in the marketplace last year, and I expect that to be much higher this year. So very strong acquisition pipeline. And then spreads on the stabilized yields in our development portfolio, yes, we've been talking for the last several quarters about that tightening. I remember 5, 6 quarters ago talking about cap rate expansion and that spread tightening and what that would do to impact our overall development portfolio. And that really just has to do with the cost of capital, volatile capital markets and who knows where that's going to go from here. It's certainly going to have something to do with the tenure and what the tenure does in the volatility in the capital markets. But overall, we build in forward risk in our overall development portfolio for the numbers that you actually see in that spread.Go ahead, Tim."", 'Timothy D. Arndt', ""Yes. I'll just highlight, I think, well if we looked at the development portfolio, you see the margin there estimated at 22. Historically, that's still a very good margin. And under conservative underwriting assumptions, I would remind everybody, we've got an inflated cost to carry in there. We've got longer lease-up times and things that we expect that will be. So I'm pretty confident we'll be several points above that estimated margin anyway."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Michael Albert Carroll', ""I guess maybe, Chris, can you provide some color on tenant's mindsets to adding more inventory? I mean is it fair to say the tenants or at least some tenants have delayed these decisions over the past year just due to the macro uncertainty? And when does this change? I mean have customer discussions changed at all given the holiday season that you kind of just highlighted and how they didn't have enough inventory levels? I mean has that been changing? Or are they ready to make those investments today?"", 'Christopher N. Caton', ""Mike, it's Chris. I think you might have answered your own question. I totally agree with the sentiment in the direction you're taking it and there's likely to be a different posture going forward. And then I'd also look proposed that you can also reach out to them and get their feedback."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""Yes. I bet you their answer is they have no idea. I mean it's just been 16 days, right, 16, 17 days since the end of the year. Many of them haven't even added up their numbers. And I think those guys don't come out with earnings releases until much later. So with Michael's question, that was the last one.

Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today."", ""With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim."", 'Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Jill. I'd like to start our call by recognizing and thanking our team for the incredible effort given over 2023. While it was a turbulent year in many ways, we ended it by delivering nearly 11% earnings growth and driving our 12-year earnings CAGR since merger to 10.3%. We deployed over $7 billion into new investments, raised nearly $2 billion of strategic capital in a very challenging environment, and delivered excellent operating results while serving and growing customer relationships."", ""We're also appreciative of the opportunity we had at our investor forum last month to share our vision and outlook for the company over the coming years. The environment is setting up in line or better than our expectations with development starts across the market continuing to decline by two-thirds from peak and an improvement in customer sentiment that appears more constructive than just 90 days ago. That said, we still see challenges in some submarkets as near-term outsized deliveries are met with still recovering demand. But our thesis remains the same as we've been describing for over a year and detailed last month in New York, which is that the supply cliff will converge with normalized demand later this year, delivering an environment conducive to strong market rent growth."", 'We believe that annual market rent growth will average between 4% and 6% over the next three years, with 2024 being modestly positive and ramping thereafter. Turning to our results. We finished the year strong with quarterly core FFO, excluding promotes, of $1.29 per share, bringing the full year to the top end of our guidance of $5.10 per share. While market occupancy declined by approximately 100 basis points, our portfolio gained 10 basis points to end the year at 97.6%.', 'Net effective rent change over the quarter was 74%, bringing the full year to a record of 77%, with another impressive result out of Southern California at over 150%, a reminder that it remains the strongest market for cash flow growth despite near-term choppiness given the large quantum of its lease mark-to-market. In the end, same-store on a net-effective basis was 7.8%, while cash was 8.5%. We started over $2 billion of new developments in the quarter across 46 projects in 27 markets with nearly 50% of the activity in build-to-suits. In energy, and as seen in our new supplement disclosure, we stand at year-end with approximately 515 megawatts of solar and storage in operation with an additional 70 currently under construction.', 'We had a quiet quarter on the financing front, raising approximately $300 million, but our full year of activity closed out at over $12 billion at a weighted average rate of 4.5% in term of 10 years. Our total debt portfolio remains at an overall in-place rate of just 3% with more than nine years of average remaining life. Turning to market conditions. The increase in fourth-quarter market vacancy was in line with our expectations and driven by demand that remain moderate as customers exercise caution in their spending, while completions hit an all-time high.', 'Development starts, however, have continued to fall across the U.S. and Europe, extending and deepening the future supply shortfall. On the ground, our teams are seeing revised customer interest with healthy showing activity to start the year. This includes build-to-suit inquiries which we expect to remain active for Prologis following a strong year in 2023.', ""Our proprietary metrics point to normal levels of activity with proposals and gestation timing in line or a bit better than historical norms. Utilization declined in the quarter to approximately 83% in keeping with this morning's reported decrease in the inventory-to-sales ratio. We view this positively because utilization ought to increase from here as stronger-than-expected retail sales over the fourth quarter and holiday season drove lower inventories, which will need to be replenished. Turning to market rents."", 'Our global view is that rents declined this quarter by 90 basis points but predominantly impacted by an estimated 7% decline in Southern California. Our full-year view is that global market rents grew by 6%, just below our expectations, ultimately driving our lease mark-to-market to end the quarter at 57% after capturing approximately $100 million in realized NOI growth from leases rolling up to market. The outlier on rent growth is clearly Southern California. While our portfolio was only 2.6% vacant at year-end, growing availability has made leasing very competitive.', 'Combined with a 110% increase in rent since 2020, the rent retracement is understandable. Historically, there has never been a market where the delta between expiring and market rents has been so large that it provides ample room for property owners to deviate for market in order to attract customers. So, looking ahead, the positive news is that we are watching two trends reverse. The first is that the supply pipeline is clearly emptying with little in the way of new starts.', 'And the second is that the escalating issues in both the Suez and Panama Canals, together with the resolution of the West Coast labor negotiations, are moving shipment volumes back to the West. While this bodes well for SoCal and still early, we are watching East Coast port markets more closely. In any event, all of these disruptions are reiterating the underlying need for resiliency and the just-in-case approach to inventories. Summing this all up globally, we recognize the high volume of near-term deliveries that need to be absorbed into our markets over the next few quarters, but we are very pleased with our ability thus far to build occupancy, drive rents and illustrate more differentiation in our portfolio as market vacancy grows.', 'As for strategic capital and valuations, we saw U.S. values decline approximately 5.5% during the quarter, which was our expectation and the reason we paused our appraisal-based activity, which includes calling and redeeming capital as well as asset contributions. We run an industry-leading franchise in which we aim to set the standard for governance, including timely, accurate and independent valuations. Calling out when pronounced the lags and valuations emerge has protected investors and demonstrated how we stand apart as a responsible partner.', ""With this quarter's value declines in a more stabilized rate environment, will resume activity in USLF, including the funding of our $250 million commitment announced in the second half of '23. Turning to guidance and all of our share, in terms of operating metrics, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, with occupancy likely to step down in the first quarter and rebuild over the course of the year. Cash same-store will range between 8% and 9%, and net effective same-store growth will range from 7% to 8%. We're forecasting net G&A to range between $420 million and $440 million and strategic capital income to range from $530 million to $550 million."", 'We have a very big year of stabilization activity ahead of us with a range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion and expected yields of approximately 6.25%. On the new deployment front, we are guiding development starts to range between 3 billion and 3.5 billion with estimated build-to-suit mix of 40%, and we plan to take sales portfolios to the market over the year with expected proceeds to range between 800 million and 1.2 billion and additionally, forecast 1.75 billion to 2.25 billion in contributions to our strategic capital vehicles. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.20 and $3.45 per share, core FFO, excluding promotes, will range from $5.50 to $5.64 per share, while core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.42 and $5.56 per share, each a bit higher than our preliminary guidance at the investor forum. While we do not forecast any promote revenue at this time, there are some small opportunities that do exist in FIBRA Prologis in our new PJLF vehicle in Japan.', ""In closing, we know that the market is not yet out of the woods with regards to incoming supply, but the combination of a stronger backdrop, continued low level of starts, and a calmer capital markets environment has us optimistic that 2024 will be another great year. As you know from our investor day, we have many initiatives in flight designed to add value beyond our real estate and because of our real estate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our plan and providing new updates throughout the year. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to get ahead of questions, which have grown a little more frequent in recent quarters surrounding market rent growth."", ""Unintentionally, we set an expectation that we could forecast market rents to a single point of accuracy in increasingly short time periods. And honestly, we're just not that good. We've gotten away from a practice that was originally aimed at being high level and directional. So, what we've elected to do in order to help investors without perpetuating the issue is to simply provide high-level rent growth expectations on a rolling 12-month-forward view."", ""As mentioned earlier, in terms of our three-year CAGR of 4% to 6%, we believe we'll see modestly positive rent growth aligned with inflation over the next 12 months, and we'll continue to update this rolling view on our future calls. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator?"", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.

Kind of maybe taking a look at your leasing spreads, obviously, very strong performance during the quarter but also a big spread between Prologis share and the kind of overall portfolio performance, which suggests stronger performance out of the U.S. Going forward into '24, you expecting this gap in performance to tighten at all, or should the U.S."", 'continue to lead the way as far as spreads go this year?', 'Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'll take that.

I guess first question would be, could you guys just go through what the uptick in property improvements in the capex section were? There's a pretty big jump in 4Q versus prior quarters. And then just second, Tim, you had kind of touched on this that tenant sentiment is improving here, and there may be better traffic going back to the West Coast with everything going in the Red Sea and the realization that just in case maybe a more prudent inventory method."", ""But I'm just kind of curious because big tenant leasing has been kind of slower over the last 12 to 18 months. Are you seeing any early green shoots on that improving as you guys are talking with customers?"", 'Tim Arndt -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I'll take the first part here, Craig, on the capex. If you take a look at the supplemental, I'd first start by widening out on overall capex before staring at property improvements. And there's just a good example here of the need to look at annual or trailing numbers as this can be a pretty volatile number quarterly."", ""Here, you can see on the full year as a percentage of our NOI, we are about 14%, roughly 15% the prior year. And, yeah, focusing in on property improvements, I suggest the same that you have to look at a trailing basis. We do tend to see higher levels of property improvement activity in the fourth quarter just by nature, but we're catching up on the full year. You can see we averaged $0.12 on the year versus the $0.21 that we had in the quarter."", ""So, that's really just a timing issue. One more thing that you can see here is the year-over-year average on that basis $0.12 versus the prior year $0.10 And I'd explain that differential as just some inflationary piece, and then the second would be some deferred maintenance and work that we're executing on the Duke portfolio."", 'Dan Letter -- Global Head of Capital Deployment', ""And maybe -- this is Dan, Craig. On the second part of your question related to tenant sentiment, I would say, at the investor day, we had talked about a marginally better tenant sentiment from the Q3 earnings call. And I would say it's even marginally better than that in the last 30 days. This is fueled by our healthy proposal volumes, customer dialogues have been strong, 45% of our available space is in discussion right now with active proposals."", ""We've anecdotally had just a number of conversations with our customer-led solutions group. Our build-to-suit conversations are improving as well. Our overall build-to-suit pipeline has grown quarter over quarter. So, whether that be some of the issues related to the Red Sea issues and the canal issues or not, I think Chris will have some comments on that."", 'Chris Caton -- Managing Director, Global Head of Strategy and Analytics', ""Yeah. I'll just go further, Craig, as it relates to port activity. We went out on a limb in September with a published research report calling for recovery in market share, and that is really, really playing out in the port activities. In November, West Coast ports were up 24% year on year."", 'Inbound shipments are up even more, and that will translate to leasing over time.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.', 'Caitlin Burrows -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning, team. Tim, earlier, you mentioned how development starts are down, maybe two-thirds from the peak, and that you're seeing little in terms of new starts broadly. When we look at your own build-to-suit split of development, it is up year over year, and then that earlier question just on customer sentiment."", 'So, I guess combining all of those pieces, how do you think that impacts your decision to do spec development versus build-to-suit over the course of this year?', 'Dan Letter -- Global Head of Capital Deployment', ""Caitlin, this is Dan. I'll respond here. A few thoughts for you. First of all, we started just over 1 billion worth of spec in the fourth quarter."", ""So, we had talked over the last several quarters about the declining starts in the marketplace, and that's when we wanted to come out of the gate here with some starts, and that's what you're seeing us do right now. We have a pretty healthy guidance here for 2024 starts at a -- owned and managed of about 4 billion. And if you think about it, that's 25 million square feet or so of starts that we could be doing this year. And we have a development portfolio right now of about 50 million square feet."", ""So, we've got an appetite for spec. Our build-to-suit volume, we think, is going to shake out in that 40% range as we've projected. And then keep in mind, we talked about this plenty at the investor day. We have $40 billion worth of opportunities in our land bank, and we have the ability to make decisions on a quarterly basis where we're going to build."", 'We own this land in 50 markets around the globe, 300 different sites. So, plenty of opportunities there.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.', 'Ki Bin Kim -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Thanks, and good morning. I just wanted to touch on the development start guidance of 3 billion plus this year. Can you just help us break that down versus -- so, traditional industrial versus like data centers or other property types? And does the pre-lease percentage that you're expecting differ a whole lot? And sorry, to add a third here. Typically, how long will the data center development is paid to cash flow?"", 'Dan Letter -- Global Head of Capital Deployment', ""Sure, Ki Bin. This is Dan. I'll hit that. First of all, we gave some guidance on our data center business 30 days ago at investor day."", ""We talked about, over the next five years, 20 or so opportunities, 3 gigawatts of data centers, 7 billion to 8 billion worth of investment. Those numbers have not changed. As a matter of fact, one thing we couldn't disclose at investor day was we started over 500 million worth of data centers in the fourth quarter alone. You won't see us guide to data centers."", 'These are very lumpy deals. And if you think about our data center opportunities, we own over 5,500 buildings. We own or control over 12,000 acres globally. So, we have one of the most important components of data centers.', 'We control the land, right? We talked about power applications at investor day. We talked about a number below 50. That number is now approaching 60. Our team is very active growing that data center pipeline.', ""Then the third component of it would be customers. And we're talking to the big hyperscalers on a regular basis. And we think it's prudent for us to be careful on how we project out what our data center volume will be because there's a competitive nature to this as well. We're negotiating with these customers, and we think it's important for us."", ""We will absolutely share with you when these projects are on the horizon. But right now, our start volume is largely industrial. And then keep in mind, our data center business is a part of our long higher and better use business. We're going to build."", ""We're going to merchant build these, and we're going to recycle that capital into the business we love so much, which is logistics."", 'Hamid Moghadam -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. To your question about how long it will take them to cash flow, there's a wider range than traditional industrial. But I would say on kind of powered shelves, it's more in the 12- to 15-month range from start and, on turnkey, depending on who does it and whether the customer does it or we do it, it could be longer than that by about a year because since the installations are pretty complicated to get these going. But all of that is built into the budgets and the economics of the transaction."", ""And this point that Dan made on the negotiating posture is really important. I mean, the last thing we want to do, there are four or five customers out there, and it's pretty obvious given the scale of the numbers, they can figure out which project is in our guidance for the next quarter if we wanted to go in that direction, and that basically reduces our leverage. So, we're just not going to do that."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Jay Poskitt with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.', 'Jay Poskitt -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit of commentary on the supply and demand trends over the next couple of quarters? You've previously said that you think deliveries will outpace demand for the next couple of quarters and then the inverse will happen after that. So, just any update on that would be great."", 'Chris Caton -- Managing Director, Global Head of Strategy and Analytics', ""Hi, Jay. It's Chris Caton. So, we project 250 million square feet of net absorption in the calendar year and 285 million square feet of completions. And, yeah, that's going to be front-end loaded, particularly on the supply side."", ""And so, we think you'll see the vacancy rate rise by another 50 to 75 basis points here in the first half of the year, peaking at 6%, maybe 6.1%, and then making a meaningful move through the subsequent rest of the year and into 2025 and 2026 based on the trend and starts that we've profiled for you."", 'Hamid Moghadam -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Let me just punctuate that. Vacancy rates will go up through the second quarter. So, don't be surprised by that. But we're pretty confident they'll come back down after that."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.', 'Nick Yulico -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the space utilization comment you made, Tim, about feeling that at this point, retailers likely have to restock inventories is actually good sign where space utilization is. I guess I'm wondering if you could give us some -- remind us sort of seasonally how this may play out historically in terms of leasing demand picking up from 3PL or retailers because of that issue of restocking? And then as well in terms of the lease proposals picking up in the fourth quarter, if you had any benefit already from that industry or even anecdotally, you could talk a little bit about the discussions there. Thanks."", 'Hamid Moghadam -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. So, the easy way of thinking about this is this. Basically, absorption and demand for our product follows a one-two-three-four scenario as you move through the quarters. It's back-end loaded toward the fourth quarter."", ""And that's historically been the relationship. Because so much of the activity occurs in the fourth quarter and so much of that activity would have been based on anticipation earlier in terms of the Christmas season, so much of the sales are in the Christmas season, the volatility is the most in the fourth quarter. This year, retail sales, and in particular, e-com sales were better than people's expectations. And the retailers were caught short in '21."", ""They were a little overstocked in '22. And now, they were back to being very careful with inventories. So, they got caught short of inventories again. That's why utilization is done."", ""They're schizophrenic. They always have too much or too little. You can never get it right. And the good news is that this Christmas season was stronger than everybody anticipated."", ""It's going to take for that to work its way back to normal."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.', 'Blaine Heck -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Great, thanks. Can you just talk broadly about valuation and cap rates? And given the continued movement in the tenure, I guess, do you think that pricing is adjusted correctly? Or could we see continued volatility in the near term? And, I guess, does that potential volatility present you with any investment opportunities?', 'Hamid Moghadam -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. We don't think the real pricing and real returns have really changed because return expectations should have been higher six months ago because of higher treasury rates. But nobody was trading based on those higher return requirements. So, nothing really happened."", ""So, it was a theoretical decline in values. I think with the treasuries now having come down, I know they've gone up a little bit just most recently, but net-net, they're down. I think the reality is the expectations of the market participants and that theoretical pricing of assets is converging. Bottom line, we think we're seeing the near bottom of valuations, both in the U.S."", ""and Europe.

Please proceed with your question.', 'Michael Goldsmith -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Another supply demand question. But just as we think about the cliff of new deliveries coming online, it sounds like that drops off in the second quarter.', ""Is there an extended period of time where we're going to need to lease these up? And so, the inflection of when supply gets better and then combined with what you're seeing on the demand side, does that mean -- does that happen through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? Or does that kind of happen just as soon as the deliveries slow? Thanks."", 'Chris Caton -- Managing Director, Global Head of Strategy and Analytics', ""Hi. It's Chris. So, I'll start off by offering. Look, the vacancy rate is going to go up to 6%."", ""Hamid and I are very clear -- the whole team is clear on that. Bear in mind, that's a very low level in the context of history. And so, yes, it will take -- there'll be time for vacancy to decline to soak up that availability. But it's going from a low level to an even lower level."", ""So, it's a bit like they can see it's going to go from 6%, it's going to move to 5.5% and likely to 5%, given the supply cliff that we see."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America.

What are they telling you in terms of how they plan to adapt to any persisting disruption around East Coast ports? Thank you.', 'Dan Letter -- Global Head of Capital Deployment', ""Camille, this is Dan. I'll start with your question on stabilization. It is a big year on stabilizations for us. We actually started the year out with some good news."", ""Late December, we actually pulled in for stabilizations that we had expected to happen in the first quarter of 2024. But overall, the timing of those stabilizations, it's spread out pretty well throughout the year.

It's Chris. I want to jump in on the disruption of the ports. We're really just now seeing the diversions as it relates to the disruptions in both Panama and the Red Sea and Suez."", ""And so, it's a bit early for us to see real medium-term leasing decisions in response to these disruptions. But number one is the clarification or the ratification of the labor agreement on the West Coast is providing a clear landscape for decision-making, and the engines of growth are beginning to kick in Southern California."", 'Hamid Moghadam -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Let me make that point a little stronger. I think all this concern about L.A. is over. And it hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but it will in the next six months."", ""So, I don't think we'll be sitting here on calls like this worrying about L.A. and its absorption. Now, will we worry about something else? I'm sure we will. I don't know whether that's going to be the East Coast or Houston or whatever."", ""But, yeah, I mean, you've seen two big movements. It's not just Suez. It's also Panama Canal and the water issues there, and the expense of shipping stuff through the canal is leading to more -- reversion back to the normal way of doing it, which is getting it to a land and land verging it over. But there could be other disruptions."", ""It could be -- something can blow up in the Persian Gulf. So, it's very hard to predict those things. The big message is this. We can spend a lot of time guessing as to what the share of West Coast is, East Coast is all of that."", ""The point is people thought COVID was the big unknown factor. And now that COVID is over, the world is going to go back to a stable, predictable, just-in-time type of inventory strategy. I think each one of these things, whether it's Panama, whether it's Suez, whether it's war in the Middle East, whether it's something in the Persian Gulf, we'll remind people that they generally need to have a more conservative inventory strategy.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron?', ""For Textron, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.74%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Textron will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Textron would post earnings of $1.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.49, delivering a surprise of +17.32%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Textron appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', ""An Industry Player's Expected Results"", ""Among the stocks in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, Lockheed Martin (LMT) is soon expected to post earnings of $7.26 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $17.98 billion, down 5.3% from the year-ago quarter."", 'The consensus EPS estimate for Lockheed has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%.', 'This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lockheed will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Accrdoing to Bloomberg, this development has raised speculations that the Federal Reserve may not be quick to implement interest rate cuts, given the apparent resilience of the economy. The likelihood of a March interest-rate cut, as indicated by Fed swaps, has now been trimmed to approximately 50%, reflecting a shift in market expectations. The surge in US retail sales, reported as the highest in three months, further intensified concerns among investors. The robust reading on retail sales triggered apprehensions about the efficacy of Wall Street's assertive dovish stance, especially in the context of favorable economic data. Central bank officials, adopting a more cautious tone regarding potential easing measures, added to the apprehension among traders. This cautious stance has created an environment where market participants are now readjusting their expectations, delaying the anticipated timing of the first Fed move. As a result, the odds of a rate reduction in the first quarter have been revised downward. The comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde underscore the concerns about aggressive market bets on interest-rate cuts. Lagarde emphasized that such speculative behavior in financial markets may not be conducive to policymakers' efforts and their ability to effectively manage economic challenges."", 'Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has commanded considerable attention at the World Economic Forum, drawing interest from major tech players like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google. In 2024, the spotlight has shifted to a more nuanced exploration of generative AI, with a specific emphasis on advancing the accuracy of AI results. This evolution is deemed critical for fostering confidence, particularly in high-stakes industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has emerged as a key advocate for this refinement, asserting that the next phase of AI development involves incorporating formal correctness into the underlying models. In an interview with CNBC, Gelsinger underscores the need for precision, especially in domains like medicine, manufacturing, and autonomous driving, where accuracy is paramount. Interviews with Gelsinger and Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, reveal a shared commitment to experimentation and co-piloting tests as instrumental strategies for improving accuracy and encouraging wider adoption of AI technologies. Shih introduces a pragmatic three-phase approach for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) adoption, which begins with assisting work, progresses to ensuring accuracy in autopilot mode, and ultimately leads to trusting the technology at chosen confidence levels. This phased approach aligns with the broader goal of making AGI more approachable and less intimidating, emphasizing the crucial role of human acceptance. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, contributes insights during panel discussions, characterizing AGI as a potent tool rather than a disruptive force replacing jobs. Altman underscores the collaborative potential of AI, describing it as an enhancer of productivity that amplifies human capabilities.', 'Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, reflects on the past year as a transformative period for AI, describing it as a time of discovery.

This adjustment in the price target indicates an optimistic outlook for the stock's performance in the foreseeable future. It is important to note that the industry context for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is crucial in understanding these recommendations. In the dynamic landscape of the technology sector, Intel, as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, is subject to various market forces and trends. The Equal-Weight rating implies that the analyst perceives Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) performance to be in line with the broader market, neither overweight nor underweight. This nuanced stance suggests a balanced perspective, taking into consideration both the company's strengths and potential challenges. The decision to raise the price target to $44 signifies increased confidence in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to deliver positive returns to investors."", 'Upslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“Intel Corporation\xa0(NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options.

Specifically, Barclays has raised the company's price target from $75 to $82, reflecting a moderate upside potential of 2% in comparison to its current market price. Despite this upward revision, Barclays maintains an Equal Weight rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) shares. This strategic move by Barclays suggests a cautious yet optimistic stance on the company's performance. The Equal Weight rating implies that, according to Barclays analysts, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is expected to perform in line with industry peers, neither overweight nor underweight. Investors may interpret this rating as an indication of balanced expectations for the stock's future performance. The increase in the price target to $82 underscores Barclays' confidence in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) ability to generate positive returns for investors. The 2% upside potential suggests a measured optimism, taking into account various factors such as market conditions, company fundamentals, and potential catalysts within the consumer goods sector."", 'Similar to the optimistic sentiments expressed by analysts towards Amazon.com, Inc.

Specifically, Lieberman has increased the company's price target by 10%, elevating it from $60 to $66. Importantly, this modification reflects a substantial upside potential of 10% in comparison to its current market price. Concurrently, Barclays has maintained an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares. The decision to raise the price target to $66 indicates a heightened level of confidence in Coca-Cola's future performance, as perceived by Barclays. This optimistic adjustment may be underpinned by factors such as anticipated improvements in financial metrics, strategic initiatives, or positive trends within the beverage industry. The Overweight rating reaffirms Barclays' belief that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is poised to outperform its industry peers. This rating suggests a favorable view of the stock's potential for delivering strong returns relative to the broader market.

This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”', 'Upside Potential: 11%', 'As of January 16, Piper Sandler has revised its assessment of Lowe\'s Companies, Inc.

The heightened target price of $245.00 reflects Piper Sandler\'s optimistic outlook on Lowe\'s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), suggesting a strong belief in the company\'s potential for future growth. This positive adjustment may be driven by factors such as anticipated improvements in financial performance, strategic initiatives, or favorable trends within the home improvement retail sector. The ""overweight"" rating underscores Piper Sandler\'s conviction that Lowe\'s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is well-positioned to outperform its industry peers. This rating implies a favorable view of the stock\'s potential to deliver robust returns compared to the broader market.

However, it's important to note that despite the upward revision in the price target, BMO Capital has maintained a Market Perform rating on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The decision to raise the price target to $194 suggests an optimistic perspective on JPMorgan's future performance, indicating confidence in the potential for significant appreciation in its stock value. This positive adjustment may be attributed to factors such as anticipated improvements in financial metrics, strategic initiatives, or positive trends within the financial services sector. The Market Perform rating from BMO Capital implies a neutral stance on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), suggesting that the stock is expected to perform in line with the broader market. While there is acknowledgment of the potential for upside, the rating indicates a measured view on the stock's relative performance compared to its industry peers."", 'In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Vltava Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co.

One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank,\xa0JPMorgan Chase & Co.\xa0(NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations.

It has also been one of the most reliable blue-chip stocks for investors over the years, with 10-year returns of over 700%, helping it reach a market cap of $485 billion. However, shares have been stagnant since April 2022, possibly leading investors to wonder whether there’s still upside potential left.', 'We believe there’s still double-digit upside to be had due to the stock’s superb qualities, reasonable valuation, and growth potential. Therefore, we’re bullish on the stock.', 'For such a large stock to register such large gains over the years, it has to have some sort of special sauce, and that’s exactly what UNH has due to its size. In Fiscal 2023, UNH reported revenue of $371.6 billion. This makes it the largest health insurance company in the world, giving it a huge competitive edge — one that’s likely to last for the foreseeable future.', 'Being the largest health insurance company in the world comes with the perk of consistent profitability, at least when combined with a solid management team. For instance, UNH has seen its diluted earnings per share (EPS) grow every year for at least the past 10 years. Over this period, its EPS has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.8%, an exceptional growth rate for a company of this size.', 'More recently, its EPS in Q4 2023 grew by 15.4% to $6.16 per share, showing that the company is maintaining this growth rate. On top of this, its return on equity has hovered around 24-27% since December 2017, showing high profitability and predictability. For context, an ROE of over 10-15% is generally considered good. With all this in mind, it makes sense as to why UNH stock has performed so well in the past.', 'In its Q4 conference call, UnitedHealth’s management expressed confidence in achieving its “long-term 13% to 16% adjusted earnings per share growth rate” for this year and 2025. Since UNH has proven itself as a company that investors can trust (especially since it essentially always beats EPS estimates), we think the firm will be able to at least meet the 13% target for the next two years.', 'The firm’s growth strategy includes expanding value-based care, growing its Medicare Advantage business by 450,000-550,000 consumers this year, leveraging AI technologies for efficiency and better service, and optimizing resource use and operational efficiency (i.e., the planned sale of its business in Brazil).', 'Given UnitedHealth’s reasonable valuation, along with its future EPS growth rate, which is forecast to be in the low-double-digit range, the stock is likely to rise by the same amount (per year) in the next few years. That’s because its next-12-month P/E ratio of 18.8x is close to its five-year average of 19.7x. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume that UNH will maintain its current multiple.', 'Put simply, if earnings grow by around 13% per year for the next two years and the stock maintains a similar valuation multiple, then the stock will also rise by around 13% per year (in a perfect world). Coincidentally (or maybe it’s not a coincidence), analysts also expect around 13% upside potential in the next 12 months, as explained below.', 'On TipRanks, UNH comes in as a Strong Buy based on 15 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average UNH stock price target\xa0of $593.13 implies 12.99% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell UNH stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Scott Fidel\xa0of Stephens, with an average return of 29.81% per rating and a 94% success rate.

To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.', 'In 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.', 'Despite a decline in worldwide dividend payouts, experts anticipate a potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the coming year. The yields experienced a decline towards the end of 2023, and there is a possibility of further decreases if the Federal Reserve decides to reduce interest rates. The outlook suggests that despite the prevailing challenges, dividend stocks might see a rebound in the future. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential. Unlike the conventional defensive categories like utilities, he emphasized the importance of investing in dividend stocks that exhibit growth qualities. According to Adam, his firm specifically focuses on dividend stocks that not only present favorable valuations but also demonstrate the capability to sustain their growth over time.', ""Mr. Adam's inclination toward dividend growth stocks aligns with historical evidence indicating their consistent outperformance. Looking at the Russell 1000 index, companies that increased their dividends exhibited an average stock price outperformance of 3.1% in the six months following the announcement of the dividend increase, as per Morgan Stanley data from 2014 onwards.

Of the 11 broad sectors of the market’s benchmark — the S&P 500 Index — the Utility sector declined more than 11%. Investors’ preference shifted to growth stocks from defensive sectors like utility as the Fed significantly reduced the magnitude of interest rate hikes.', 'However, the utility sector is likely to regain momentum in 2024. In its December FOMC meeting, the Fed clearly gave signal to end the current rate hike regime. There is a high probability of interest rate declines in 2024, which will benefit the utilities.', 'Utility operations are capital-intensive, as consistent investments are required to upgrade, maintain and replace older wires, electric poles and power stations. Hence, apart from internal fund sources, utilities depend on the credit market for funds to carry on upgrades.', 'The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. Such companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which will always be in demand.', 'Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.\xa0 Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.', 'Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.', 'Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta >0 but <1). These companies generally provide a good dividend. Investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option if volatility persists in early 2024.', 'If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.', 'We have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY, Dell Technologies Inc DELL and Apple, Inc. AAPL.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of treatments targeting serious medical conditions. The company boasts a number of market-leading drugs including Eylea for several eye diseases, and Dupixent for asthma.', 'Eylea in particular has been an important growth driver for the company as demographic trends in the US and abroad have led to impressive adoption of the drug.', 'Additionally, a new drug combination that the company is introducing to improve the treatment of obesity, which compliments the exceptionally performing GLP-1 drugs could lead to another major growth catalyst. As the company attaches itself to this new mega-trend, it may ride to coattails of a secular shift in healthcare.', 'Furthermore, in what has been a somewhat challenging opening few weeks for the broader stock market, the healthcare sector has shown encouraging relative strength, further improving the odds of near-term strength.', 'These catalysts, along with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating make Regeneron Pharmaceutical a compelling investment consideration.', 'Although we are just two weeks into the year the healthcare sector has outperformed the broad market and all other sectors by a notable margin. The Healthcare ETF is up 2.6% YTD vs the S&P 500 ETF (-0.17%).', 'Additionally, something I have noted in my other publications on Zacks, is the increased uncertainty around the beginning of US presidential election years. The first quarter often shows elevated volatility; however, the healthcare industry has consistently shown defensive capacity in those situations. So, in the case of market weakness, we should see this sector holds up better than the others.', 'The introduction of GLP-1 therapeutics, which are semaglutides traditionally used for treatment of diabetes, have flipped the medical industry on its head. After realizing that these can be used for treatment of obesity and induce rapid weight loss, drug manufacturers like Eli Lillyand Novo Nordisk were quick to release a product.', 'Ozempic and WeGovy have exploded in use and popularity as their effectiveness for weight loss has become undeniable. However, recent studies have shown that while users can rapidly cut fat, they may also lose significant muscle in the process.', 'But Regeneron may have a solution to this growing problem. A new drug currently under review may offer the possibility of addressing the loss of muscle mass, making it a logical pair in the treatment plan.', 'If this is the case, the new drug may attach Regeneron to this super trend, which has already sent Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk rocketing higher over the last year.', 'These developments have not gone unnoticed, and earnings estimates have been getting upgraded over the last two months. FY23 earnings have been revised higher by 1.3% and FY24 by 5.8%. Sales for the current year are expected to grow 6.5% to $12.96 billion and 5.2% next year to $13.63 billion.', 'Additionally, Regeneron is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 24x, which is well below the industry average 96.6x, and just above its 10-year median of 22.5x.', 'As Regeneron pushes to new all-time highs, this momentum is likely to continue as these bullish factors carry it higher. For investors interested in adding exposure to healthcare or defensive oriented-stocks, REGN is worth looking at.', 'Petco Health and Wellness, the pet retail superstore with 1,500 locations across the US, Mexico and Puerto Rico has struggled in its competition against e-commerce in recent years, ceding valuable market share.', 'A slowdown in growth following the Covid recovery boom and high expenditures have also played a role in pushing the stock lower and shifting analysts to the bearish side. Petco Health and Wellness currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating and should thus be avoided until a material fundamental change.', 'Earnings estimates have plummeted in the last two months, giving Petco Health and Wellness Co. the lowest Zacks Rank. Current quarter earnings estimates have been lowered by (-86%) and are projected to fall (-91%) YoY to $0.02 per share. Additionally, FY24 estimates have fallen by (-71%) and are forecast to decline (89%) YoY to $0.08 per share.', 'Additionally, sales for this year are expected to grow 3% YoY to $6.2 billion and just 0.13% next year.', 'WOOF stock has been selling off since its IPO and is down a cumulative (-90%) since then. Clearly something is going wrong at the company. That being said, one day there will likely be a bottom, as the Petco brand is extremely well-known. Because of that, I don’t think this is a stock that investors should sell short, but rather be avoided until things markedly improve.', 'The U.S. PC market is finally rebounding after witnessing a decline in sales for several quarters. Although year-over-year sales are still down, the good sign is that sales are rebounding as inflationary pressures ease and consumers’ confidence in the economy strengthens.', 'According to the latest report from Gartner, global PC shipments totaled 63.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2023, increasing for the first time after eight consecutive quarters of decline.', 'For the year, global PC shipments totaled 241.8 million units, down 14.8% year over year from 2022. Sales were dominated by the market leaders and the top six sellers held on to their positions. However, the performances were mixed.', 'Lenovo Group Ltd. recorded solid year-over-year sales growth. LNVGY shipped 16,213 units and was the top seller with 25.6% of the market share.', 'Dell Technologies Inc held the third position. DELL shipped 9,983 units in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dell Technologies commanded 15.8% of the market share in the fourth quarter, down from 17.2% a year ago.', 'Apple, Inc. shipped 6,349 units and held the fourth position.

This subtle growth suggests that demand and supply are finally balanced. However, this situation will likely change due to the anticipated component price hike [in] 2024, as well as geopolitical and economic uncertainties,” Mikako added.', 'The PC market took a hit in 2022 as soaring commodity prices started taking a toll on consumer spending. Consumers started spending cautiously and cut down on expensive items as the Federal Reserve launched its monetary tightening campaign to bring down 40-year high inflation.', 'This saw the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, which finally started paying off late last year as inflation declined sharply.', 'This once again saw demand rebounding. The picture looks a lot brighter for the PC market now.

And we had no idea what applications were ultimately going to show up on that iPhone, and the things that we were able to do with it, and the use cases that came."", ""And I think we're sort of in that same phase right now, particularly with enterprise use cases.

So the guys that you're talking to are clearly probably more with the details. But what I believe is that the large language models that are largely being built off of available information-- sucking information from the internet-- over time, you're going to get the information loaded, and they're going to be effective.

Like where are we in that adoption cycle?', 'CHUCK ROBBINS: So how technical do you want to go? So--', 'JULIE HYMAN: Not too. Not too.', ""CHUCK ROBBINS: So let's take NVIDIA as an example. Today, NVIDIA sells their GPUs, and they have a networking technology that they sell with it. It's called InfiniBand. And most of the web scale players and others who are building these large language models want to use ethernet instead of InfiniBand. They want to use a standard technology."", ""There are some special features that we need in ethernet to make that viable. But we're now running ethernet underneath the GPUs in pilot phase in a lot of the web scale players today. And so that's a big opportunity for us, because as they build that out, and we get this technology underneath, then every time the GPUs go in, you're going to see our technology underneath it."", ""Then the enterprise is really trying to figure out-- you're going to have-- you're going to need to build a stack of technology that allows customers to take small amounts of their data and put it at the edge of their enterprise, closer to where the customer is. And they're going to want to run inference models. And so we'll be-- we're working on designing what that might look like.

But I mean, that's what the markets-- the market is the market, right? So it's-- and part of the reason-- I made a comment earlier this week about the valuations relative to their revenue, but the reality is is that to get started in these businesses required so much capital, that the valuations are just naturally going up because of the amount of capital that's being infused to build out the underlying technology infrastructure. So I do understand how it's happened. I just don't know how it ends."", ""But no, I think you're right. We've made-- we've made several acquisitions in our security portfolio and in our collaboration portfolio that we have just gained incredible AI talent. So we're pretty excited about that. So I think you will see us continue to do that."", ""JULIE HYMAN: One of the other things we've been talking about is companies have been around for a while that are undergoing some changes. The Splunk acquisition-- and when that closes, that will be a change for you guys. You're trying to diversify a little more into services, as I understand it."", 'CHUCK ROBBINS: Software, yeah.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Software. Away from the traditional business for you guys. So what does Cisco look like five years from now?', ""CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, we've been working on this transition-- and when we close Splunk, I think our software business will be somewhere around $22 billion. And so we've made a lot of progress. And I don't know if that makes us number five or six or something in the world."", ""But at the same time, we still have a pretty meaningful hardware business. And the internet needs us to be a really good hardware company, because all the technology that we need to continue to support all the increased traffic that we see around the world. So I think you're just going to see both sides continue to increase."", ""I think as this AI thing explodes, my expectation is that our infrastructure equipment that goes with it will also go up. And we'll continue to invest in our software assets and add more software assets to it where we can."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: We've talked to a lot of leaders here so far at the conference. And I think they know a little bit about AI. But for many of them, this is new. And it might be more new stuff coming at them tomorrow. As a leader, how are you staying informed about a technology that wasn't around 20 years ago, and things might be different a week from now?"", ""CHUCK ROBBINS: We have a-- about three of my direct reports are pretty deep in it. And so they give us primers almost every week on what's going on, what's changing, how things are evolving. And so we just-- we spend a lot of time with them educating the rest of the team."", ""And we're building-- we're now building a plan for how do we educate different aspects of the company on how they should be thinking about it. I've asked every function inside the company to give me their plan for how generative AI is going to fundamentally change the productivity or whatever they do. And so everybody's working through that as well. So it's all educational as we go."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Fascinating stuff. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins, thanks for giving us time at Davos.
