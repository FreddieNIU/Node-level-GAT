To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn.Christopher Hohn is a British billionaire and hedge fund manager known for his charitable work and huge donations, as well as his brutal activist campaigns. Hohn founded The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) in 2003. Hohn had pledged to donate 50 basis points of the management fee to The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a charitable fund founded by Hohn and his ex-wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn. The foundation’s primary goal is to transform the lives of children and adolescents. It’s also working for several other causes, including climate, sexual &amp; reproductive health and to improve the lives of girls all over the world.In addition to his charity, what sets Hohn apart from other hedge fund managers is his laser-focused and often stubborn approach in activist investing. TCI Fund Management posted profits for 13-straight years through 2021. The fund lost money in 2022 as it fell by 18%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report, which cited a person with knowledge of the matter, said the fund lost money due to its huge bets on Alphabet and Microsoft. Shares of major tech companies fell in 2022 as investors fled growth stocks and found refuge in value and dividend plays.Chris Hohn's Latest Activist CampaignsUnlike several other major hedge funds, Hohn’s fund is highly concentrated in a few stocks. This makes the hedge fund vulnerable when the overall market declines. Despite this, Hohn has been relentless in pushing companies to make fundamental changes and improve their performance. One of his recent targets is Alphabet. Back in November, Hohn penned a letter to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, asking the executive to take “aggressive action” to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.Story continuesWhat makes this letter interesting is that it was written before Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) came under immense pressure amid the AI threats following the launch of ChatGPT and before analysts and investors started openly criticizing the company for over-hiring. Ultimately, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) had to accept the reality as the company announced to lay off thousands of jobs earlier this year.However, Chris Hohn is still not happy.In another letter to Sundar Pichai on January 20, Hohn said that while he likes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management is finally doing something to right size the company’s overgrown size and costs, the 12,000 job cuts “do not even reverse the very strong headcount growth of 2022.”Hohn said that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management will “ultimately need to go further.”Hohn also said that the median salary at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is too high and he believes the company is now in a position to decrease its salaries since the competition for talent in the industry has fallen significantly.Earlier in February, billionaire Hohn wrote a letter to Airbus (AIR.PA), in which TCI has a $4.3 billion stake. The billionaire said he was writing to “urge you to immediately terminate"" negotiations with Atos over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian. Hohn said that investing in Evidian would be “value destructive” and he believes Evidian “is a low-quality, highly levered company, with 60,000 employees, operating in an extremely competitive market.”That’s not the first time Hohn used the word “value destructive” in his letter. In 2021, the hedge fund manager had asked Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) to drop its bid for Kansas City Southern. Hohn said that the deal faced significant regulatory hurdles and a decision to create a voting trust “would be hugely value destructive”.The company went ahead with the deal that ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles, just as Hohn had warned in his letter. Giving in to the huge pressure from Hohn, Canadian National announced in October 2021 that its CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest will leave the company as soon as January.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris HohnChris Hohn Hohn's Climate ActivismChris Hohn’s activism also addresses the climate change problem. And unlike other fund managers who are happy with just publishing yearly climate reports and talking ESG scores, Hohn has a no non-sense approach when it comes to ESG as he believes most of the activism in the climate space is not producing any results.Hohn, who donates to Extinction Rebellion, said at the Bloomberg Intelligence ESG Investment Forum in London in May 2022 that ESG engagement is not producing any meaningful results.“We should stop pretending and just be honest. The acid test is actual emissions, are they falling or are they rising? And they’re rising. And that’s where the rubber hits the road.” We picked the top 10 stocks from Chris Hohn’s fourth quarter of 2022 portfolio for this article.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Chris Hohn sold over 5 million shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) during the fourth quarter of 2022, ending the period with just 5,191 shares of the company, which were worth about $1.1 million. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022,  83 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), down from 74 funds in the previous quarter.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital Management specifically said about Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a large railroad company that carries freight across the western US and between Canada and Mexico. It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, TCI Fund Management reported owning about $35.12 million worth of stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) via 67,770 shares. In February, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, which was a 16.7% increase from the previous dividend. The dividend is payable on April 14 to shareholders of record as of March 15.Polen Capital made the following comment about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a leader in attractive end markets with a skilled management team who has demonstrated the ability to consistently and wisely allocate capital. It is the world leader in serving science. It is a globally scaled supplier serving more than 400,000 customers working within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, research institutions, and government agencies. Thermo provides many of the products and services that companies in these industries, particularly pharma and biotech, need to operate and drive science forward. The company manufactures and sells instruments, reagents, and consumables used for a wide range of applications in labs.Sales are also well balanced geographically, including leading scale in emerging markets, according to our research.The business meets all our financial guardrails. We view Thermo Fisher as an extremely durable business, and we expect mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth over the long term. With expanding margins and wise capital deployment, we expect mid-teens underlying earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.We also think Thermo Fisher’s business would be very durable in an economic downturn as pharma and biotech customers account for roughly 60% of the company’s sales today and roughly 80% of sales are highly recurring consumables and services. Thermo received a COVID boost as they supply COVID PCR tests as well as some products used in the production of COVID vaccines. As such, it is in the process of growing over that excess demand. We expect the company to move past this growth headwind by the back half of 2023. At approximately 24x our estimate for nexttwelve-months earnings per share, we believe Thermo’s valuation is attractive for this type of consistent, well-managed, and durable business.”8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 209Chris Hohn owns about 15.9 million Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Overall, 209 hedge funds out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.In February, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald said in an interview on CNBC that he believes the AI hype has created opportunities for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The analyst acknowledged that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing some threats in the market and the launch of its chatbot was underwhelming but he still believes the AI deployment is possible without disrupting Google's core business.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our biggest detractors in Q4 included communication services sector holdings Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). For Alphabet, Google’s parent company, growth has decelerated as advertisers have pulled back on digital ad spend following a COVID-driven acceleration as well as due to economic uncertainties. Longer term, Alphabet remains well positioned to win in multiple ways, whether in search, online video or in the cloud. We continue to see large profit pools for Alphabet in the early stages of monetization, along with the migration of advertising dollars away from traditional mediums, like TV, to online search and video. These factors give us confidence Alphabet continues to have a long runway to grow revenue and profits. Additionally, management has returned capital to shareholders— another lever that can be used to increase the per share value of the business. We view Alphabet as one of the best businesses in the world, capable of expanding revenues at an above-average rate for years to come, with a bulletproof balance sheet and an average asking price. It’s a name we’ve held since 2015, and we believe Alphabet will continue to be a strong compounder of value in the future.”7. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s shares have gained about 6% year to date. For the fourth quarter, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) posted adjusted EPS of $1.60, beating estimates by $0.13.

S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn. Recently, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) posted its Q4 results that beat analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.54, beating Wall Street estimate of $2.48.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for Beginners10 Mad Money Stock Picks This WeekDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts.Investing in the stock market for the long term is perhaps the surest of the ways to expand your wealth. On the books it sounds very easy: just invest your money in stocks for the long term and forget. But the pull of the short-term cycles and volatility is so strong that many give in and cash out or change their strategies before their investments could bear fruit. While panic selling or cashing out doesn’t hurt in the short term, when you contextualize these short-term, often irrational decision making based on data, the real toll of short-term thinking comes to light.For example, a study by Franklin Templeton Investments shows that if you had invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 Index on January 1, 2003, your original investment would have grown to $62,755 by the end of 2022. But that’s not the most interesting part. What makes the study interesting is that its data shows that if you missed just 10 days out of this 20-year period (total 5,035 trading days), your final return would be reduced by a whopping 64%. That means not having your money invested in the stock market for just 10 days in this 20-year period would give you $28,750 at the end of 2022, and not $62,755. That’s because individual days in the stock market have a lot of ups and downs. If you cash out or panic sell during bad days, you lose the potential profits that come on good days.The kind of volatility and turmoil investors are seeing in 2023 amid the collapse of SVB and recession warnings is unprecedented. In this backdrop the importance of long-term investing becomes more important. That’s why we decided to take a look at some of the best long-term stocks according to Wall Street analysts.Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the top 50 holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and picked 15 stocks which have the highest upside potential from their current levels based on their one-year average price targets.

We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates.

(NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91One-Year Average Price Estimate: $196.35While Tesla, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls, Cathie Wood, earlier this year said Tesla stock could hit $500 per share by 2026 based on its EV business aloneClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, also fits squarely within our earnings reset group. We took advantage of its enterprise multiple falling back to historic lows to initiate a starter position in the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EV) and developer of battery technologies. Tesla has a significant structural cost advantage in battery production, EV manufacturing and EV selling, which gives it industry-leading operating margins in EVs. As the auto cycle has softened, the stock has sold off substantially with the rest of the automakers, despite EVs continuing to have a secular growth advantage. Tesla has a clean balance sheet with negative net debt and enormous revenue growth, EBITDA growth and free cash flow generation. Its margin buffer also gives the company the ability to cut prices while still protecting earnings better than competitors, which should help support continued volume growth. There is also significant upside optionality driven by its software offerings, which we do not believe is currently priced into the stock.That being said, Tesla is highly indexed to a flagging auto market and we expect its earnings outlook to worsen in the near term. We are also monitoring increasing EV competition and the recently emerging risks to the brand and management integrity raised by CEO Elon Musk’s actions at Twitter to determine future position size in the portfolio.”7.

The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below.

The biggest reductions in weight were UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which is capped at a 2% weight as it ranks in the bottom quartile of the fund by valuation.”6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135One-Year Average Price Estimate: $169.38That Apple Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.Financial markets are currently wavering following the SVB collapse and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s roadmap to tame inflation. Some analysts believe the central bank could pause interest rate hikes to stop a possible crisis spillover in the banking sector. But others question how the Fed would be able to tame inflation if it pauses its interest rate hikes? Only time would tell could be the right answer since experts have been proven wrong time and again given the unprecedented nature of the crisis we are seeing in the markets where history is no longer a guide.However, when it comes to dividend stocks, history does provide some guidance. Data shows that when markets are going through turmoil and recession is around the corner, dividend growth stocks provide a solid refuge to investors. An S&amp;P Global report said that companies that have a strong track record of growing their dividends provide investors a chance to have exposure to “high-quality stocks and greater income over time, therefore buffering against market volatility and addressing the risk of rising rates to some extent.”One of the most important reasons why investing in dividend growth stocks seems worthwhile is the buffer against volatility that comes with having an exposure to these stocks. The S&amp;P Global report said that during Dec. 31, 1999 to March 31, 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 and S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index by an average of 140 bps per month and 49 bps per month, respectively, during down market cycles.A detailed research report by Raymond James also mentions several data points highlighting the performance of dividend stocks during recessionary periods. The report, titled “Investment Strategies for Recessionary Periods,” says that for investors who are increasingly sensitive to market fluctuations” and want to “proactively manage volatility,” high quality fixed-income and dividend-producing equity investments are suitable as they have historically shown resilience during recessionary environments.Story continuesMost Promising Dividend Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used the Finviz stock screener to find stocks with dividend yields over 2% whose average analyst price estimates are at least 30% above their current stock prices.

Beijing sees control of the waters around it as crucial to maintaining its sovereignty and economic strength.The West, however, fears that growing naval strength is part of a long term plan for China to invade Taiwan, an ambition that would hand Beijing potentially devastating economic leverage.China's path to global dominationTo understand China’s growing focus on the seas that border it to the east, look first at its demographics and economy.China is a gigantic nation with 1.4 billion people, more than any other on Earth, and a likewise gigantic $18 trillion industrial economy which is only outmatched by one other: the USA.However, China does not have anything like sufficient energy supplies to run that economy, nor enough home grown food to feed its people. Vital imports of both come by sea.Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, right, meets with US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese, left, at Point Loma naval base in San Diego, US, Monday March 13, 2023, as part of Aukus, a trilateral security pact between Australia, the UK, and the US. (Leon Neal/Pool via AP) - Leon Neal/Pool via APThe Middle Kingdom is powered overwhelmingly by coal (55pc of primary consumption), oil (19pc) and gas (9pc). China has to import half of its gas and more than half of its oil. Even though it is a gigantic coal producer, China also has the largest coal imports in the world.The great bulk of the coal comes from Indonesia and Australia; the oil from many places, but primarily the Middle East. A third of the gas comes by pipeline from elsewhere in Asia, but the rest is in LNG tankers that cross the sea.Even China’s own production is often offshore: the Bohai oil field, China’s biggest, is in the Yellow Sea.Some people suggest that oil and gas fields might be a key issue in the South China Sea, where China has been increasingly aggressive, but in truth there aren’t enough resources there to seriously interest Beijing.Story continuesThat doesn’t mean China is uninterested in the stretch; far from it. Control of the South China Sea is of great strategic importance.Supertankers carrying millions of barrels of crude oil move into the Sea through the Singapore Strait every day, carrying vital supplies not only to China but onwards to the similarly energy-hungry industries of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.It’s a similar picture with LNG gas tankers and Australian and Indonesian coal shipments.Australia is one of China’s most important trading partners, not just for fuel but for food too.Despite China’s vast size and tracts of fertile land, it has one of the lowest amounts of arable land per head of population in the world.Australia, by contrast, has the world’s highest area of arable land per head of population. It produces more than three times as much wheat as it consumes, much of which is exported to China.Demand for meat has also soared in China in recent decades. Australia produces a lot of beef, a fact that has not gone unnoticed.In 2015 and 2016, Chinese firms attempted to buy Australia’s largest cattle business, Kidman and Co, which owns 2.5 percent of the total Australian land area: about the same area as South Korea. The Australian government nixed those plans, but even so China remains the second-biggest foreign landowner in Australia (the first and third are the UK and US.)China is also heavily dependent on Australian iron ore to supply all its mighty heavy industry and construction.Indeed, iron ore may be an issue on which Australia holds the whip hand. Not only does Australia supply 60pc of China’s massive iron ore requirement, Australia has the largest global supply of the metal at present.This picture may change – for instance a massive China-backed iron ore project in Guinea, on Africa’s west coast, may now be lumbering forward after many years mired in corruption scandals – but this will take time.For now, China relies on Australia but it is a somewhat uneasy trading relationship, one in which the power balance is constantly being measured.War threatens microchip crisisElsewhere, across the Yellow Sea lies South Korea, another important global manufacturing powerhouse, and beyond that Japan.And of course to the south, the potential flashpoint: the Switzerland-sized island of Taiwan, just 80 miles across the water from the Chinese mainland.Taiwan is where the old Republic of China (ROC) government fled to in 1949 after the rise of the communist People’s Republic. Beijing refuses to acknowledge Taiwan’s independence, but it is a practical fact.Taiwan is nowadays a tremendously important place. This is primarily because of its huge semiconductor industry.In money terms only 20pc of the global chipmaking industry is in Taiwan, but this takes no account of the decoupling that has taken place between chip design and manufacture.Taiwan is far and away the world leader in actual fabrication of semiconductors. It makes around 50pc of the global supply, no matter that the lucrative design work may well have been done somewhere else – quite likely in the UK, given the popularity of designs from Cambridge-based Arm.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world’s biggest player in chip foundries and makes huge numbers of Arm chips, to the great benefit of the UK economy (the other world foundry giant is Samsung of Korea: again, a short sea trip from China.)Taiwan is particularly important to the People’s Republic. Much as everyone has grown accustomed to seeing “made in China” stamped on electronic goods, the People’s Republic cannot make the chips inside the hardware.It’s generally estimated that China has to import 80pc of the chips it needs. Even Chinese factories that do make chips import the machinery needed for manufacturing.Some observers have gone so far as to say there is a “Silicon Shield” in place: China would not dare to invade Taiwan in case the vital chip factories were damaged or destroyed, thus crippling China’s own lucrative manufacturing.That argument has not been heard so much lately, especially since the US placed a fairly damaging stranglehold on chip supplies to China as part of the ongoing trade war. The US has done this by insisting that anyone using US technologies cannot do business with Chinese firms.The effect is often felt in places like Taiwan and Korea, where a chip factory is prevented from selling US-designed chips, or chips made using US machinery, to China.It would seem that Xi Jinping may be thinking of seizing the means of production intact. Even if an invasion does damage TSMC’s output, this would hurt the West at least as much as China. The semiconductor supply crisis we have seen from 2020 onwards would be minor by comparison.A battle for democracyVladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine has broken the taboo and made it clear that invasion is an option.Fear of economic disruption from any invasion of Taiwan is one reason for the Aukus pact: a good, if selfish, reason.Yet there is also a moral issue: democracy must be defended.Taiwan started out as a one-party totalitarian state like the People’s Republic, but in the 1980s a transition to democracy began, with elections and opposition parties.In 2016 the opposition finally won control of the legislature from the incumbent KMT party. This, and judicial reform, caused analysts at The Economist to upgrade Taiwan in their grading system from a “flawed democracy” to a “full democracy”.FILE - Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin talk to each other during their meeting in Beijing, China on Feb. 4, 2022. China says President Xi will visit Russia from Monday, March 20, to Wednesday, March 22, 2023, in an apparent show of support for Russian President Putin amid sharpening east-west tensions over the conflict in Ukraine. (Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP, File) - Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP,Ironically they dropped the USA from “full” to “flawed” the same year. Meanwhile, the UK and Australia are both “full democracies” like Taiwan. The People’s Republic is “Authoritarian”, the lowest possible grade democracy-wise.Two realms - democracy and authoritarianism - are clearly defined. Neither side will tolerate incursion into the other.In simple terms, Taiwan and Aukus are the good guys, if occasionally flawed. Xi Jinping’s regime – though not the Chinese people themselves – are the bad guys.It’s worth being clear on that, as there is often a fatal temptation to make friends with the People’s Republic for the purpose of doing business with China: and not just in Taiwan or Australia either.If China should attempt to invade Taiwan, this would be something every bit as worthy of fighting against as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, perhaps even more so given the vital importance to Britain of Taiwanese semiconductors. Aukus should stand ready to repel a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.Against today’s background of war in Ukraine and sabre rattling in Beijing, the Aukus deal might seem a little slow-moving. The central element of it, the nuclear-powered submarines for the Australian navy, will not even start to arrive until the 2030s.But the truth is that Beijing, despite its posturing, will not be ready to invade Taiwan until then – if so soon. Right now, for instance, it’s hard to imagine any invasion scenario which would not see Australia cut off supplies of iron ore: that on its own would be a body blow for China.It would hurt Australia too, but much of the pain would be passed on to the largely overseas owners of Australian iron mines. In this context it’s pleasing to note that the largest single shareholder in Rio Tinto, biggest mining operator in Australia, is actually the Chinese government.Are Xi's forces ready for war?Even if Xi doesn’t care about Australian ore, or coal or wheat or beef either, China would need to be able to move troops across the Taiwan Strait safely. This would require at least partial control of the sea and the sky above it.This is unlikely to be a matter of warships, at least in the Strait itself, and at first it may not be a matter of aircraft either. Both the People’s Republic and Taiwan have substantial armouries of long-ranging missiles.In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, center, poses with for photos with Taiwanese navy personnel during inspection of Taiwan's annual Han Kuang exercises in Taiwan on Tuesday, July 26, 2022. The Taiwanese capital Taipei staged a civil defense drill Monday and Tsai on Tuesday attended the annual Han Kuang military exercises, although there was no direct connection with tensions over a possible Pelosi visit. (Shioro Lee/Taiwan Presidential Office via AP) - Shioro Lee/Taiwan Presidential OfficeTo give just one example, as far back as 2008 Taiwan was putting its own Hsiung Feng 2E cruise missiles into sustained production. HF-2Es can strike targets hundreds of miles into mainland China, and Taiwan has at least hundreds – possibly more than a thousand – of them.The new Yun Feng supersonic cruise missile is probably operational in small numbers by this point: it could hit targets across most of China’s developed regions, including Beijing. Taiwan also has hundreds of anti-shipping missiles threatening the Strait.Not many countries can produce this kind of high-tech weaponry themselves: but Taiwan, as we have seen, is in some respects more advanced than leading Western nations. Its missiles probably work just as well as theirs.Any invasion campaign would likely commence with a massive missile bombardment, with Beijing seeking to knock out Taiwan’s missiles and air bases.However, the bulk of Taiwan’s weapons are mounted on mobile launchers which are kept parked in hardened facilities. This would be no simple matter.Are Xi’s forces truly ready for this sort of thing?The People’s Republic has put its armed services through many reorganisations and modernisations over the decades, transforming them from the enormous peasant army of the early days.But it was only in 2015 that the air force and navy stopped being subordinate departments of the army: Western analysts still tend to speak of the People’s Liberation Army (Navy), Plan, and the People’s Liberation Army (Air Force), Plaaf.The communist structure has only recently started to seriously get its head around the idea that a huge land war against Russia or Vietnam is not the primary scenario.Shortly after the military shake-up, which acknowledged the importance of sea and air power, a further change saw the Chinese heavy missile force become a branch in its own right, like the new independent navy and air force. This is the PLA Rocket Force, or Plarf.Plarf controls China’s small force of land-based intercontinental nuclear missiles. More to the point for invading Taiwan, it also has around 2,000 conventionally armed weapons: not so many as to offer a really crushing superiority over the Taiwanese arsenal, especially as many are based on old Soviet technology.It seems fairly unlikely that today’s Plarf alone will be able to fully suppress Taiwan’s mobile ship-killer batteries and make a crossing of the Strait practical.China's air force will need to play its part here. Will it be able to win control of the skies above Taiwan and the Strait, as Russia’s air force has not been able to above Ukraine?On paper it should be able to, with almost 3,000 combat aircraft against Taiwan’s 470-odd. A dozen or two of these are the vaunted Chengdu J-20s, claimed to be a genuine fifth-generation stealth fighter like those of America. There are larger numbers of supposedly dangerous fourth-gen Russian Sukhois and Chinese licence- built versions of them.Far too many of China’s planes, though, are licence-built Mig-21s: 1950s technology. China’s air force, then, mostly has no better equipment than Russia’s and often has worse.Aukus could tip the balance of powerIt seems likely that, as with Russia, China’s air force is not yet capable of complex combined-air-ops fighting of the sort that has let US-led alliances to dominate the skies above Iraq and Libya.It was only in 2019 that the Plaaf started to get serious about advanced pilot training, setting up dedicated Top Gun-style academy units rather than carrying out all operational training in front line squadrons. The Plaaf itself says its current transformation will not be complete until 2035.Taiwan’s air force is a lot, lot better than Ukraine’s. It has a mixed force of decent US-supplied F-16 Falcons and indigenous Ching Kuo jets and proper US-supplied radar planes. It has a force of US-supplied maritime surveillance P-3s, a vital capability for an island nation.Many of these planes are kept in largely invulnerable bases dug into the sides of mountains: it will be very hard to knock them out on the ground. China may well damage air base runways, but runways are easy to repair quickly and all military air bases have specialist teams dedicated to that job.Taiwan also has hundreds of high-end US Patriot surface-to-air missiles, which would take a fearsome toll of Plaaf aircraft and might even knock down inbound Chinese ballistic missiles. Then there are many hundreds more American Sparrows, not as advanced but still very dangerous.If Russia couldn’t dominate Ukrainian skies, it’s very clear that China has little chance of dominating Taiwanese ones: not yet, anyway. It’s very unlikely that China would be able to make the Strait safe enough to mount an amphibious crossing – today. And this is before we even consider US intervention.That’s why Aukus is all about the future. The day may very well come in the 2030s when China’s missile and air forces will be strong enough to reach out and dominate Taiwan and the seas around it. China may well establish its own iron mines in Africa and a blue-water navy able not only to take control of the South China Sea but the waters around Korea, Japan and even Australia.But by then, there will be a new base at Perth with Aukus nuclear-propelled submarines operating from it.Nuclear propulsion is critical. Conventionally powered submarines are almost useless if radar-equipped enemies are operating against them. Conventional subs must run on the surface to move at any speed, but this means they are easily detected and sunk.Standard diesel-electric subs must extend “snort” air-intake masts above the surface to cover any distance while submerged. This slows them down even more and makes them almost as easily detected as if they hadn’t bothered to go under.There are various “air independent” conventional propulsion options which offer some fully submerged range, but they too mean very slow travel and troublesome topping up with exotic fuels after any prolonged use.First-rank navies don’t bother with conventional subs: in the age of radar they are of very limited usefulness.Undated BAE handout image of a mock up of what an SSN-AUKUS submarine will look like.

It can stay fully submerged for months, going as fast as a speedy surface ship the whole time.The Aukus nuclear subs of the future will be a terrible problem for the possible advanced Plan and Plaaf of the future. To be safe from them, any Chinese naval task force will need to move inside an expensive, advanced bubble of anti-submarine escorts and aircraft: even in China’s own waters, let alone on blue-water operations.Such a bubble would need to be extended over the Strait in the event of any Taiwan invasion: yet another huge, expensive capability for the now-faltering Chinese economy to pay for.Without this support, unseen Aukus subs might suddenly launch weapons from almost any piece of sea at almost any target ashore or afloat, anywhere across the Asia-Pacific region.Aukus doesn’t totally transform the picture, but it does tip the balance of power in the region back towards the West and its democratic allies in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.It will let Australia trade with China from a stronger position, reassured that the possible future blue-water Chinese navy will not have things all its own way.And Aukus will push the possibility of a Taiwan invasion even further into the future. At any rate, it will be avoided altogether.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Coal Mining Stocks To Buy Today. Coal occupies a central position in discussions related to climate change and energy because it is the most significant source of energy worldwide for producing electricity, iron, and steel, and cement. Additionally, it is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide among all energy sources. Despite the existence of climate and energy targets, the ongoing energy crisis has compelled several nations to boost their dependence on coal. On March 14, Fitch Ratings slashed its 2023 price assumption for Australian thermal coal. The recent revision in their metallurgical coal price projections is based on a combination of factors. Firstly, there is a boost in demand as China has lifted its ban on imports from Australia. Secondly, production costs in the sector have increased by approximately 25% in 2022 due to inflation in fuel, energy, and labor costs, along with the new royalty regime in Queensland. Lastly, there is significant supply volatility from Australia which also affects the price projections.The Chinese government's data released on March 15 showed that coal production in China increased by 5.8% during the first two months of 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year. This was due to the addition of new mining capacity and the government's encouragement of miners to increase production to improve energy security. China is the largest coal miner and consumer in the world, with a production of 734.23 million tonnes during the January-February period, compared to 686.6 million tonnes in the same period in 2022, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. China's focus on energy security has been amplified due to the disruption of energy supply chains and a significant rise in global coal prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Some of the best coal stocks to buy include Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK), CONSOL Energy Inc.

(NYSE:SXC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Suncoke owns five cokemaking facilities in the U.S. capable of producing 4.2 million tons per annum (mtpa) of blast furnace coke. Coke is a key raw material used in the process of producing steel via the blast furnace method. In addition to its cokemaking operations, SXC owns a collection of marine terminals, the largest of which is the Convent Marine Terminal (CMT) in Louisiana. CMT has the capacity to transload 15 mtpa of coal and other industrial materials. In 2020, CMT accounted for 55% of U.S. thermal coal exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast and 15% of total U.S. thermal coal exports.While the broader steelmaking industry recently benefited from all-time high steel prices, resulting in record production levels, growing cash flow, and improving balance sheets, SXC has continued to trade with a free cash flow yield in excess of 20%, reflecting considerable concern about the company’s prospects. I believe there is a broad misunderstanding of the SXC story driven in part by shallow analysis of the company’s business model and cash flow prospects. I believe fair market value ranges from $14-$17, representing an upside of 84-122% from current levels. What’s more, SXC represents an attractive takeout target for industry-consolidator Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), which at a minimum provides downside protection, but also offers a potential catalyst for value realization in the future. ” (Click here to see the full text)7.

Stakeholders were unsure whether Willow would go ahead after several delayed oil and gas leases and cancelled oil pipelines in the U.S. However, following repeated bids from ConocoPhillips and Alaskan politicians for the project to go ahead, to support Alaska’s economy, which still relies heavily on oil and gas, Biden approved Willow.Willow was previously approved under the Trump administration but was halted by a decision by a federal judge in Alaska in 2021. The judge cited “serious errors” in ConocoPhillips’ environmental review of the project, with little analysis of the climate impact the project would have. President Biden has also faced significant pressure over the project, with climate activists and international organisations suggesting that his approval of the project would go against U.S. climate aims and recent policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). They pointed out that if the project went ahead it would lead to many more decades of oil production in an area that is volatile to climate change, as well as increasing carbon emissions in the region significantly.Despite concerns about whether it would go against U.S. climate aims, Biden approved the $8-billion Willow Project this week. While there were many reasons to cancel Willow, there are also several positives being seen by the state and federal governments. The project is expected to bring in $17 billion in revenue for the federal government, and generate huge revenues for Alaska, as well as create 2,500 new jobs. There is an estimated 600 million barrels of oil reserves in Willow and the project is expected to bring between 160,000 bpd and 180,000 bpd of crude oil online, supporting U.S. aims to boost national production and enhance its energy security.Related: Blackrock CEO Fink: Oil &amp; Gas Is Vital In Meeting Energy NeedsConocoPhillips will be permitted to drill three well pads in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, which covers 23 million acres of public land. This will prolong the life of Alaska’s oil industry. The CEO of ConocoPhillips, Ryan Lance, stated that the approval “was the right decision for Alaska and our nation.” Lance added, “Willow fits within the Biden administration’s priorities on environmental and social justice, facilitating the energy transition and enhancing our energy security, all while creating good union jobs and providing benefits to Alaska Native communities.”Story continuesRegional opinions on the project have been split. State lawmakers are enthusiastic about Willow bringing jobs and greater revenue to the region, helping to reduce Alaska’s reliance on federal funds. A coalition of Alaska Native groups on the North Slope is also hopeful that money from the project will be pumped into education and healthcare in overlooked communities. However, Alaskan natives living close to Willow are concerned about the health and environmental threats the project will bring.Climate activists are also outraged by the decision, having spent years warning policymakers of the potential risks involved with the project and lobbying against it. Over one million letters were written to the White House opposing Willow, as well as almost three million signatures collected on a Change.org petition. Environmental organisations are now expected to seek an injunction to try to block the project, likely resulting in delays. The project’s construction can only be carried out in the winter season as Conoco requires ice roads to build the project’s infrastructure, so delays could have a major impact on the project’s timeframe.In a bid to reduce the project’s impact on the environment, the U.S. Department of the Interior insisted on lowering the number of drilling sites from five to three. In addition, ConocoPhillips was asked to relinquish rights to about 68,000 acres of existing leases in the region to the government, to establish a buffer between exploration and development in the region outside of Willow. These changes to the original plan are expected to help reduce the negative effect of the project on climate change and wildlife in the region, although many suggest that the approval of any form of Willow will exacerbate climate change in the region. Willow could be operational for as long as 30 years, releasing as much as 278 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions, according to U.S. Department of the Interior estimates.  Jeremy Lieb, an Alaska-based senior attorney for environmental organisation Earthjustice, stated “We and our clients don’t see any acceptable version of this project, we think the [environmental impact] analysis is unlawful.”However, the Biden Administration said its hands were tied when it came to approval as ConocoPhillips already had valid leases in the region, meaning that legally, courts would not have permitted the government to reject or drastically reduce the project. The rejection of the project could have left the government with high fines and facing legal action from Conoco.Just because the Alaskan Willow Project has been approved it doesn’t make it any less controversial. Following several advances in U.S. climate policy, Biden’s approval of the ConocoPhillips project came as a shock to many, a turnaround on his ambitious climate pledges. While the government promised a scaled-down version of the project, there will inevitably be significant pushback from climate activists and groups hoping to stop Willow altogether.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Gains Slightly As Saudi And Russian Officials MeetUK Considers Easing Windfall Tax Pressure On Oil And GasA North Sea Hydrogen Pipeline Network Is PossibleRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

After a series of world-class onshore oil discoveries during the 1980s and 1990s petroleum became an important economic driver. During the early 2000s, Colombia’s slumbering oil boom again roared to life as President Alvaro Uribe promoted the hydrocarbon sector’s development to maximize the economic windfall from petroleum. As a result, Colombia’s oil industry assumes a crucial role in the economic miracle that materialized as the Andean country emerged from decades of civil war and cocaine fueled violence.A dearth of proven oil and natural gas reserves did not hold Colombia back. During 2013 production peaked at just over one million barrels per day making the Andean country the fourth largest producer in Latin America. While output has declined sharply since then, with government data showing that production fell to a daily average of 754,199 barrels during 2022, Colombia is now Latin America’s third largest oil producer due to Venezuela’s petroleum output collapsing under the immense pressure of strict U.S. sanctions. Data from government statistical agency DANE shows by 2013 that crude oil was responsible for over half of Colombia’s exports by value, 20% of government revenue and 4.5% of gross domestic product. That highlights just how central black gold was to Colombia’s economic miracle during the 2000s which saw it possess one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America.Related: Oil Gains Slightly As Saudi And Russian Officials MeetThis, however, came at a price with Bogota and industry participants turning a blind eye to the impact of industry operations on local communities. Colombia’s oil industry is responsible for considerable environmental damage, with many such incidents obscured from public scrutiny. That is one of the reasons leftist guerillas, the now demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC – Spanish initials) and the National Liberation Army (ELN – Spanish initials) considered energy infrastructure to be a legitimate target in their struggle against the state. By the early 2000s extortion of oil companies and kidnapping of industry workers had become an extremely lucrative source of income for guerillas, while attacks on pipelines, wellheads and other hydrocarbon infrastructure was common.Story continuesIn around two decades, the strife-torn South American country became economically dependent on crude oil and the tremendous profits black gold generates. Bogota’s ruthless pursuit of expanding petroleum exploration and development eventually allowed Colombia to emerge as the third-largest oil producer in Latin America as strict U.S. sanctions crushed Venezuela’s petroleum industry. The dependence on crude oil is responsible for considerable environmental fallout and significant community dissent. Oil spills and other incidents became common place, especially as leftist guerillas stepped up attacks on industry infrastructure, notably pipelines, while some drillers demonstrated little regard for the environment. This is responsible for a high incidence of spills, with at least 139 such events occurring between 2011 and 2021, inflaming tensions with communities in the region’s where the industry operates.There are allegations that many local communities were coerced into approving petroleum projects along with claims that drillers and the national government have failed to deliver the infrastructure, payments and services pledged during negotiations. This is responsible for fanning dissent in the areas where the oil industry operates with most being remote regions with a weak government presence and a dearth of crucial hard and soft infrastructure including roads, schools and health facilities. There is also consternation regarding the alleged collusion of Colombia’s armed forces and right-wing paramilitary groups with industry actors to quell community dissent. It is for these reasons that relations between various community groups, drillers and the national government are strained and explains why road blockades, oilfield invasions and violent community protests are frequent events in regions where the industry operates.These factors indicate that there is no easy solution to resolving community tensions and Colombia’s economic dependence on crude oil. In fact, despite the economic contribution of petroleum declining over the last decade the industry was responsible for 2.6% of Colombia’s GDP during 2022 as well as a third of exports and almost a fifth of government revenue, demonstrating oil still plays a decisive economic role. That will only expand, despite Petro’s pledge to end awarding hydrocarbon exploration contracts, because of the November 2022 tax hikes. Those reforms saw the application of an incremental tax on the proceed of oil sales when the Brent price exceeds set values and removing royalty payments as an income tax deduction. When coupled with additional tax reforms including a higher levy on dividend payments and the introduction of a wealth tax, Bogota expects to generate an additional $4 billion in fiscal revenue at a time when budget deficits are spiraling higher.Ending hydrocarbon exploration will threaten Colombia’s energy self-sufficiency and challenge the country’s energy security. There are fears that this will see Colombia’s hydrocarbon reserves exhausted in a decade and that oil production will fall by 30% over that period. Such a sharp decline will force Colombia to significantly increase the importation of oil, natural gas and related products, primarily gasoline, diesel and liquified natural gas to meet domestic energy needs. A natural gas shortage is already impacting Colombia. The severity of those supply constraints is highlighted by the Colombian Association of Gas Marketers (AGREMGAS - Spanish initials) estimating liquified petroleum gas imports needed to quadruple during 2022 to meet booming domestic demand as supply constraints became more pronounced.Any substantial increase in hydrocarbon imports will place significant pressure on Colombia’s fiscally fragile economy which is highly reliant upon the financial contribution of the hydrocarbon sector. There is also the potential to trigger an energy crisis, especially when it is considered that the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP – Spanish initials) believes the Andean country’s hydrocarbon reserves will be exhausted in a decade if oil exploration is banned. Petro’s plan to import natural gas from neighboring Venezuela, to cover at least a supply shortfall, appears unachievable despite securing a deal with the OPEC member’s national oil company PDVSA to export the fuel to Colombia. A combination of corroded pipeline infrastructure, a lack of capital and U.S. sanctions all make it extremely difficult for PDVSA to deliver the 50 million cubic feet per promised.Colombia’s president and his energy minister recently expressed their commitment to ending oil exploration and transitioning the country to a greener less oil dependent economy. While the fallout for Colombia from such an event could be severe, it will be offset by Petro’s guarantee that his administration will respect existing industry agreements, thereby allowing industry participants to confidently continue with their operations. Such a decision still poses grievous risks to Colombia’s already fragile economy by significantly shrinking exports and government revenue. That will squeeze Bogota’s finances at a crucial time when the economy is facing considerable uncertainty and runaway inflation, which will be magnified by the peso tumbling as the value of exports plunge.By Matthew Smith for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Will Juicy Dividends Get Axed Amid Rising Interest Rates?UK Considers Easing Windfall Tax Pressure On Oil And GasA North Sea Hydrogen Pipeline Network Is PossibleRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn.Christopher Hohn is a British billionaire and hedge fund manager known for his charitable work and huge donations, as well as his brutal activist campaigns. Hohn founded The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) in 2003. Hohn had pledged to donate 50 basis points of the management fee to The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a charitable fund founded by Hohn and his ex-wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn. The foundation’s primary goal is to transform the lives of children and adolescents. It’s also working for several other causes, including climate, sexual &amp; reproductive health and to improve the lives of girls all over the world.In addition to his charity, what sets Hohn apart from other hedge fund managers is his laser-focused and often stubborn approach in activist investing. TCI Fund Management posted profits for 13-straight years through 2021. The fund lost money in 2022 as it fell by 18%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report, which cited a person with knowledge of the matter, said the fund lost money due to its huge bets on Alphabet and Microsoft. Shares of major tech companies fell in 2022 as investors fled growth stocks and found refuge in value and dividend plays.Chris Hohn's Latest Activist CampaignsUnlike several other major hedge funds, Hohn’s fund is highly concentrated in a few stocks. This makes the hedge fund vulnerable when the overall market declines. Despite this, Hohn has been relentless in pushing companies to make fundamental changes and improve their performance. One of his recent targets is Alphabet. Back in November, Hohn penned a letter to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, asking the executive to take “aggressive action” to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.Story continuesWhat makes this letter interesting is that it was written before Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) came under immense pressure amid the AI threats following the launch of ChatGPT and before analysts and investors started openly criticizing the company for over-hiring. Ultimately, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) had to accept the reality as the company announced to lay off thousands of jobs earlier this year.However, Chris Hohn is still not happy.In another letter to Sundar Pichai on January 20, Hohn said that while he likes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management is finally doing something to right size the company’s overgrown size and costs, the 12,000 job cuts “do not even reverse the very strong headcount growth of 2022.”Hohn said that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management will “ultimately need to go further.”Hohn also said that the median salary at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is too high and he believes the company is now in a position to decrease its salaries since the competition for talent in the industry has fallen significantly.Earlier in February, billionaire Hohn wrote a letter to Airbus (AIR.PA), in which TCI has a $4.3 billion stake. The billionaire said he was writing to “urge you to immediately terminate"" negotiations with Atos over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian. Hohn said that investing in Evidian would be “value destructive” and he believes Evidian “is a low-quality, highly levered company, with 60,000 employees, operating in an extremely competitive market.”That’s not the first time Hohn used the word “value destructive” in his letter. In 2021, the hedge fund manager had asked Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) to drop its bid for Kansas City Southern. Hohn said that the deal faced significant regulatory hurdles and a decision to create a voting trust “would be hugely value destructive”.The company went ahead with the deal that ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles, just as Hohn had warned in his letter. Giving in to the huge pressure from Hohn, Canadian National announced in October 2021 that its CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest will leave the company as soon as January.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris HohnChris Hohn Hohn's Climate ActivismChris Hohn’s activism also addresses the climate change problem. And unlike other fund managers who are happy with just publishing yearly climate reports and talking ESG scores, Hohn has a no non-sense approach when it comes to ESG as he believes most of the activism in the climate space is not producing any results.Hohn, who donates to Extinction Rebellion, said at the Bloomberg Intelligence ESG Investment Forum in London in May 2022 that ESG engagement is not producing any meaningful results.“We should stop pretending and just be honest. The acid test is actual emissions, are they falling or are they rising? And they’re rising. And that’s where the rubber hits the road.” We picked the top 10 stocks from Chris Hohn’s fourth quarter of 2022 portfolio for this article.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Chris Hohn sold over 5 million shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) during the fourth quarter of 2022, ending the period with just 5,191 shares of the company, which were worth about $1.1 million. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022,  83 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), down from 74 funds in the previous quarter.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital Management specifically said about Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a large railroad company that carries freight across the western US and between Canada and Mexico. It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, TCI Fund Management reported owning about $35.12 million worth of stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) via 67,770 shares. In February, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, which was a 16.7% increase from the previous dividend. The dividend is payable on April 14 to shareholders of record as of March 15.Polen Capital made the following comment about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a leader in attractive end markets with a skilled management team who has demonstrated the ability to consistently and wisely allocate capital. It is the world leader in serving science. It is a globally scaled supplier serving more than 400,000 customers working within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, research institutions, and government agencies. Thermo provides many of the products and services that companies in these industries, particularly pharma and biotech, need to operate and drive science forward. The company manufactures and sells instruments, reagents, and consumables used for a wide range of applications in labs.Sales are also well balanced geographically, including leading scale in emerging markets, according to our research.The business meets all our financial guardrails. We view Thermo Fisher as an extremely durable business, and we expect mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth over the long term. With expanding margins and wise capital deployment, we expect mid-teens underlying earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.We also think Thermo Fisher’s business would be very durable in an economic downturn as pharma and biotech customers account for roughly 60% of the company’s sales today and roughly 80% of sales are highly recurring consumables and services. Thermo received a COVID boost as they supply COVID PCR tests as well as some products used in the production of COVID vaccines. As such, it is in the process of growing over that excess demand. We expect the company to move past this growth headwind by the back half of 2023. At approximately 24x our estimate for nexttwelve-months earnings per share, we believe Thermo’s valuation is attractive for this type of consistent, well-managed, and durable business.”8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 209Chris Hohn owns about 15.9 million Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Overall, 209 hedge funds out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.In February, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald said in an interview on CNBC that he believes the AI hype has created opportunities for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The analyst acknowledged that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing some threats in the market and the launch of its chatbot was underwhelming but he still believes the AI deployment is possible without disrupting Google's core business.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our biggest detractors in Q4 included communication services sector holdings Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). For Alphabet, Google’s parent company, growth has decelerated as advertisers have pulled back on digital ad spend following a COVID-driven acceleration as well as due to economic uncertainties. Longer term, Alphabet remains well positioned to win in multiple ways, whether in search, online video or in the cloud. We continue to see large profit pools for Alphabet in the early stages of monetization, along with the migration of advertising dollars away from traditional mediums, like TV, to online search and video. These factors give us confidence Alphabet continues to have a long runway to grow revenue and profits. Additionally, management has returned capital to shareholders— another lever that can be used to increase the per share value of the business. We view Alphabet as one of the best businesses in the world, capable of expanding revenues at an above-average rate for years to come, with a bulletproof balance sheet and an average asking price. It’s a name we’ve held since 2015, and we believe Alphabet will continue to be a strong compounder of value in the future.”7. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s shares have gained about 6% year to date. For the fourth quarter, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) posted adjusted EPS of $1.60, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue in the quarter fell 16.2% on a YoY basis to $1.29 billion but beat estimates by $20 million. For 2023, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) expects its revenue to increase in the mid-to-high-single-digit percent range. Adjusted EPS is expected to come in the range of $9 to $9.50 versus the consensus of $9.28.Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management owns a $2.5 billion stake in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, as the hedge fund upped its stake in the company by 12% in the period. Overall, out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), down from 63 hedge funds in the previous quarter.6. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn. Recently, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) posted its Q4 results that beat analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.54, beating Wall Street estimate of $2.48. Reported revenue in the period came in at $2.94 billion, crushing past the analyst estimate of $2.88 billion.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 97 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI), followed by William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management which owns a $696 million stake in the firm.Andvari Associates made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for Beginners10 Mad Money Stock Picks This WeekDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$3.23b-US$3.01b-US$2.28bUS$1.16bUS$1.63bUS$2.11bUS$2.56bUS$2.95bUS$3.28bUS$3.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 40.83%Est @ 29.20%Est @ 21.06%Est @ 15.36%Est @ 11.38%Est @ 8.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% -US$3.0k-US$2.6k-US$1.9kUS$886US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.9bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.1%) = US$74bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$74b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$38bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$41b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$16.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PG&amp;E as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.825. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PG&amp;EStrengthNo major strengths identified for PCG.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

To see more such companies, go directly to Graham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks.Graham Stephan is perhaps one of the most popular celebrities in online wealth creation communities. With over 4.2 million subscribers on YouTube, Stephan actively shares tips and commentary on how to get rich via real state, stock investing, cryptocurrencies and more. Stephan, who became a millionaire at the age of 26, in his YouTube channel description box says that he started working in the real estate industry shortly after turning 18.A lot has been said about how Graham Stephan became successful and his lifestyle. In this article’s intro we want to discuss Stephan’s investment philosophy and what he’s been saying about the stock market recently.On March 8, Graham Stephan uploaded a video on his YouTube channel titled “A Warning for the 2023 Stock Market.” Stephan highlighted how this year got off to a solid start but then things started to south as data showed inflation is still high and the Federal Reserve is ready to keep raising interest rates. Stephan said that “nobody has the slightest clue” on whether or not we are in a bear market.Stephan said the he expects 25bps rate hikes for the rest of 2023 from the Federal Reserve.“The Golden Butterfly Portfolio”Time and again Graham Stephan has talked about how investing in stocks is full of volatility and how hard is it for even the expert investors to post strong returns by investing in individual stocks. Stephan in a February 2023 video talked about “The Golden Butterfly Portfolio” which he thinks is a strategy to handle “whatever Jerome Powell throws your way, from recessions, unemployment, rise in inflation, deflation and even and endless money printer.”This portfolio invests in stocks, equities, bonds and commodities. This four-quadrant approach, according to Stephan, helps you handle the four cycles of the broader economy, which are rising prices, falling prices, rising growth and falling growth.Story continuesAccording to Graham Stephan, the only way to protect yourself in the ever-volatile markets is to diversify your portfolio. In a video, he said:If you can’t personally handle a 20% drop without panicking it’s probably a sign that you are invested too aggressively. For instance if you are completely in US tech stocks then it’s probably a good idea to add large caps and international stocks to the mix too.On December 7, 2022, Graham Stephan said in a tweet that the stock market was presenting one of the “best entry points”  in the last 15 years.“If you wished you could go back in time and invest in 2009, now would be that opportunity.”Stephan then went on to mention five index funds he believes were the best to invest in to benefit from this opportunity. In-line with his investment philosophy, these index funds give investors ample exposure to the total stock market and remove volatility and risks.Graham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Chris Liverani on UnsplashIn the first part of this article, we will mention the five index funds recommended by Graham Stephan. In the second part of the article, we will mention some interesting stock picks of Graham Stephan which he initiated following an interesting (but highly random) method as part of an experiment.

24,de095596-e822-3a16-af2c-27e352045aa5,PM,2023-03-19,7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy for Income Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-yield-dividend-stocks-223541378.html,1678919741,STORY,"['PM', 'RITM', 'DVN', 'LYB', 'GMRE', 'ZIM', 'GECC']","[In general, investors who park their capital in dividend stocks tend to be more conservative with their money. They tend to like the dependable dividends paid from their stock holdings, often used as income. Accordingly, such investors often purchase dividend stocks that come with yields in the 2-4% range traditionally considered a healthy range.Of course, there are plenty of dividend stocks that provide yields outside of this range. For investors with higher risk tolerance levels, high-yielding dividend stocks may be the preferred choice. These are companies with much more robust risk profiles, but which can often provide outsized gains (if the individual investor knows what they’re doing).Here are seven such high-yielding dividend stocks I think is worth a look. That’s despite warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates may have to go higher throughout 2023 than initially projected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZIMZIM Integrated Shipping$24.07GECCGreat Elm Capital$8.82RITMRithm Capital$8.00LYBLyondellBasell Industries$84.16DVNDevon Energy$45.12PMPhilip Morris$96.18GMREGlobal Medical REIT$9.44ZIM Integrated Shipping (ZIM)Container ships now carry about 90 of the world's cargo and the largest container ships can carry over 21,000 units. This one is operated by ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM stock)Source: Darryl Brooks / Shutterstock.comZIM Integrated Shipping (NYSE:ZIM) is one of the highest-yield dividend stocks on this list and one of the highest-yield dividend stocks, period. That makes the shipping and logistics firm inherently interesting to income investors right now. The Israeli company has provided a long stretch of dividends that provide intrigue for investors looking for ways to play the supply chain sector.ZIM Integrated Shipping’s business dates back to 1945, and the company began operating shipping container logistics in the early 1970s. However, the company’s dividend only stretches back to the late summer of 2021. In those six periods, the company has paid massive dividends that truly impress. Most recently, the company paid a $2.95 dividend in November. Over the last year, it has paid a whopping $27.55 of dividends, higher than its current $20.25 share price.Story continuesThat’s probably unsustainable given that one of those dividends was worth $17. But $2.95 on a $20.25 share price is still a very high 14.56% yield. That was what the company paid most recently, and is very much in line with previous payments.Great Elm Capital (GECC)Stock market digital graph chart on LED display concept. A large display of daily stock market price and quotation.Source: Feylite / ShutterstockGreat Elm Capital (NASDAQ:GECC) is a company that invests in the debt of middle-market firms, and derives income from those investments. In turn, investors who purchase its stock to fund those investments receive high-yield dividends for their trouble. Currently, that yield is approaching 20%. Indeed, GECC stock certainly isn’t for the faint of heart, but it can provide a substantial additional return for those seeking yield.The company is currently beefing up its investment in the healthcare space. It closed on the purchase of three healthcare asset-based loans in December. Further, the company formed Great Elm Healthcare Finance in cooperation with an affiliate of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. Healthcare is a relatively stable sector due to the truism that demand for healthcare is relatively inelastic. People need to see doctors regularly. That lends credibility to the idea that the company is steadier than it may seem at first glance.The downside is that GECC stock may already be fully-priced at these levels. Still, its dividend alone is likely to produce double-digit returns for investors willing to place a bet on this stock right now.Rithm Capital (RITM)A small house made of wooden blocks and colored sticky notes with the words Mortgage buydowns.Source: Villi-Vonki / Shutterstock.comInvestors willing to bet that the mortgage market is okay should also consider Rithm Capital (NYSE:RITM) stock. It is a real estate investment trust that focuses on the mortgage sector. That will be off-putting to investors who worry that we may already be in the midst of another bubble, similar in magnitude to the subprime mortgage crisis.Yet, at the same time, Rithm Capital’s financial statements don’t suggest trouble at all. Its revenue and net income figures improved in 2022 over 2021. The company’s recent results showed bottom-line net income of $983,285 in 2022. Thus, it is not a large company, nor does it boast massive profits. Some investors simply overlook this stock due to its size and lack of great assets.That said, I think this is a stock with obvious upside, at least according to analysts. Additionally, the company’s dividends have been continually increasing since mid-2020. Finally, Rithm Capital is a REIT, so investors will receive 90% of company profits by law.The risk is clear: further rate hikes could negatively affect the already wobbly mortgage market and Rithm Capital by extension. But those willing to take accept this risk could earn substantial returns from here.LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a much less risky stock than prior equities on this list. Its 5.24% yield is still considered ‘risky’ but it’s substantially lower than the aforementioned names on this list. That lower risk is primarily due to the company’s core business, in plastic resin and chemical production. Generally-speaking, its a much more predictable industry than those of the previously mentioned names.Furthermore, investors with a penchant for ESG stocks might also like LyondellBasell Industries. It boasts all kinds of achievements in its latest earnings report. Most notably, the company received an EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance, ranking in the 91st percentile among 7,500 firms surveyed.The company’s revenues slipped slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4. That said, overall 2022 revenues increased to $50.45 million from $46.13 million a year earlier. The firm’s stock has roughly $7 of upside beyond its current $91 price. When combined with its dividend, the returns with LYB stock quickly become very attractive.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comLet’s start with Devon Energy’s (NYSE:DVN) dividend in discussing it as an investment. Just a few weeks ago, Devon Energy reported 2022 full-year results. The news was good: fixed dividends were increased by 11%. Indeed, 2022 was a strong year for the energy sector. The results were positive for Devon Energy as well, leading to a dividend payment during the year that more than doubled to $5.17.Let’s move to the macroeconomic catalysts that could benefit the company more generally. Investors are unsure of what to expect from the energy sector in 2023. That’s where the risk is for the company. If a recession officially begins or some new variant of Covid-19 emerges the economy will falter. In short, demand would quickly weaken and prices would fall.Yet, that isn’t what Wall Street is expecting from the company. Instead, analysts see substantial upside for investors over the coming 12-18 months. The company hasn’t reduced its dividend since 2017 so that should only add to the potential upside with this stock..Philip Morris (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comI’ve focused on Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock for its dividend and positive catalysts a few times over the past months. It bears repeating – while cigarette sales have been declining for some time, Philip Morris is the best-placed large tobacco company. Its smokeless tobacco strategy and portfolio make it very noteworthy. Its 5.13% dividend only makes it that much more interesting.Philip Morris’ IQOS tobacco e-cigarette and vape products are garnering a lot of attention from analysts who like that the company is finding ways to replace cigarette revenues better than its competitors. The firm’s Swedish Match purchase, a company that produces snus, nicotine pouches, and lighters, has proven beneficial with strong overall growth.In short, Philip Morris is a so-called sin stock that many perceive to be past its best days. However, it is arguably in the middle of an impressive pivot. And that pivot has all kinds of upside that could reward investors.Global Medical REIT (GMRE)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockGlobal Medical REIT (NYSE:GMRE) is investment grade for several of the same reasons as Green Elm Capital above. For one, REITs are obligated to reward investors with 90% of profits. Of course, that only truly matters if those profits are growing.Fortunately, they are. In 2022, the company’s net income reached $13.32 million, up from $11.8 million in 2021. And revenues continue to grow in both the most recent quarter and the throughout 2022.Global Medical REIT leases medical facilities to healthcare providers. It is currently in the process of buying a property for $6.7 million. And it has two properties under contract to be sold for a total of $11.6 million.The company’s portfolio of properties was 96.5% occupied at the end of 2022 and projects a base rent of $114.5 million. Again, healthcare real estate tends to be more stable than many other subsectors, adding weight to the argument that favors the company and its high-yield dividend.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Gold is almost always in the spotlight as investors tend to flock to the precious metal amid geopolitical unrest, rising inflation, recession fears, and other uncertainties. Ever since the stock market turmoil started on the back of rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s subsequent rate-hike spree, investors have been keeping gold stocks on their radar.In December 2022, Juerg Kiener, managing director and chief investment officer of Swiss Asia Capital, said in an interview with CNBC that gold prices could reach between $2500 to $4000 sometime in 2023. The analyst said at the time that he was expecting a mild recession in the first quarter of 2023, which would cause many central banks to slow the pace of interest rate hikes and make gold even more attractive.The analyst also said that if inflation persists, gold will gain more traction all over the world because the analyst thinks it’s a “good inflation hedge, a great catch during stagflation and a great add onto a portfolio.”After strong jobs report and signs that inflation is not declining in the US, the rally in gold prices that we saw during the start of the year collapsed as investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue its rate hikes. When interest rates rise, investors cling to yield as gold doesn’t pay anything. A stronger dollar is also making it difficult for foreign investors to buy gold. Near the end of 2022 analysts were predicting that gold will make a strong recovery in 2023 based on their expectations that inflation will fall and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate hikes. But those expectations fell flat. But gold price is now on the rise ever since the banking sector started wavering. Some analysts hope that the Federal Reserve can put brakes on its rate-hike spree to avoid more problems for the banking sector. On March 17, spot gold jumped about 3.1% to $1,977.89 per ounce, which was its highest level since April 2022. U.S. gold futures also jumped 2.6% to settle at $1,973.50 as of March 17.Story continuesAnother latest catalyst for gold prices came when the ECB went ahead with rates hikes despite the latest crisis in the banking industry. The decision of the ECB caused the euro to gain and the dollar to lose value, ultimately helping gold prices. Analysts believe the latest cracks in the banking system have caused investors to yet again flee to gold, the ultimate safe haven asset.The latest market situation does provide an opportunity for long-term investors to pile into gold stocks that are currently undervalued.Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top 11 gold stocks with PE ratios less than 20 as of February 24 that have the highest number of hedge fund investors.

SSR Mining’s stock has fallen significantly this year due to lower precious metal prices and the temporary closure of its Copler mine. We repurchased its shares in late September after the Copler mine restarted on schedule, since the stock remained depressed. SSR Mining should generate significant free cash flow at current gold and silver prices and has a very strong balance sheet with over $600 million in net cash and $4.1 billion in stockholders’ equity. While we expect the stock to remain volatile, we believe the company is selling at an attractive price relative to its asset-heavy balance sheet and our net asset valuation.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now10 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now30 Most Famous Yale Students of All TimeDisclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That war continues this year, validating the world’s increased investments in military, defense, and aerospace equipment.Last Dec. 2022, Japan hiked its annual defense budget by 25%. It will buy more weapons including Tomahawks. Germany hiked its defense budget by up to EUR 10 billion in 2024. This aligns with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meeting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s guideline of spending 2% of the country’s gross domestic product.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPresident Biden has outlined the importance of out-competing China globally.

The company increased its dividend by 4.8% year over year for shareholders of record on Apr. It increased its dividend 26 consecutive times annually.GD stock slipped ahead of the company’s earnings report. The market reacted to three deliveries pushed out to the next quarterly reporting period.Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic said that General Dynamics could not complete one of the orders in time. A customer delayed two international deliveries. Impatient investors should take advantage of the stock’s weakness. The company will probably meet its production targets in the next year.General Dynamics expects the elevated threat environment will materially increase demand for army and land forces capabilities. Its backlog and its order book continue to grow.Story continuesExpect contracts for combat vehicles from Europe – including Poland, Romania, and Switzerland – to increase. General Dynamic’s revenue will also grow from the corresponding increase in sales of ammunition and projectiles.Heico (HEI)graphic of magnifying glass zooming in on Hawaiian Electric Industries (HE) webpageSource: shutterstock.com/Casimiro PTHeico (NYSE:HEI) is an aerospace and electronics firm. In the first quarter, it posted a 27% increase in net sales. It recorded a record $620.9 million in revenue in Q1/2023. The steady backlog growth suggests a long-term rise in HEI stock.Heico’s backlog is around $856 million. The Electronics Technologies Group (“ETG”) subsidiaries are unique. They supply mission-critical, high-reliable products for customers.It is an irreplaceable business that benefits from strong margins. Shareholders should expect flight support and ETG demand to increase as government defense budgets expand. The disruption in the supply chain is easing. By later this year and into next year, expect Heico to fulfill orders and record higher revenues.ETG margins will fluctuate in the coming quarters. Sales of high-margin products will vary. The product mix will shift favorably as customers buy Heico’s more profitable goods. For example, the demand for components in missile defense is strong. Governments are investing more in defensive equipment. This will lift sales of flight support and related electronics.Howmet Aerospace (HWM)a close-up shot of an airplane engineSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.comHowmet Aerospace (NYSE:HWM) manufactures components for jet engines and for aerospace applications. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it reported revenue of $1.5 billion, up by 18% year over year.The firm increased shareholder returns by buying back stock worth $65 million, paying a dividend of four cents a share. It also bought back $9 million in debt.This is among the defense stocks to buy after defense aerospace revenue grew by 13%. Howmet managed the customer inventory correction for the F-35 (combat aircraft). Looking ahead, the company expects its defense unit to grow in the single-digit percentage in 2023.It will have less overhang from the F-35 structures inventory. In addition, Howmet benefits from strong demand for the F-35. Builds for this aircraft are high throughout the rest of the decade.Howmet has a diversified business. It supports aerospace, drones, and helicopters. Gas turbine revenues will also grow in the single-digit percentage. As a result, investors benefit from Howmet’s exposure to the oil and gas market.L3Harris Technologies (LHX)An office building with the logo for L3Harris Industries visible on the building.Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.comL3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is a good income stock after it increased its cash dividend. Its continued contract announcement affirms its growth ahead. On March 6, L3Harris announced a contract to secure long-lead material for the Viper Shield electronic warfare system.L3Harris is expanding its growth by acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD). This firm has $7 billion in backlog. The extended business cycle will increase revenue visibility over several years. It has several multi-year programs that are coming due. As a combined company, L3Harris may renegotiate better terms. This will increase its profit margins.L3Harris will offer strong alternatives for the U.S. Department of Defense. It will compete to win defense contracts in the munitions space. To strengthen its air and land markets, the company is investing in advanced Tactical Data Link. This will expand its waveform library.In the maritime sector, L3Harris has an autonomous undersea vehicle. It recently achieved its first-ever repetitive submerged launch and recovery from a torpedo tube. This is the first step in achieving the nation’s autonomous undersea solution.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has a $5 billion potential from products like HIMARS and GMLRS.Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said that PAC-3 is an integrated air and missile defense that is a primary driver of its missiles and fire control market.When Poland said it would spend 4% of its gross domestic product on defense in 2023 it was the highest current level in NATO. It also translates to $1.5 billion in sales for Lockheed in the second half of this year.Lockheed is one of the best defense stocks to own because orders keep rising. It will realize higher revenue when it fulfills orders with deliveries, probably in late 2024 into 2025.CFO Malave said that Turkey wants to buy more F-16s. This would lead to additional orders of up to 300 aircraft. India is interested in F-21s, creating an opportunity for Lockheed Martin. Investors should look for governments planning to spend more on the military. This will result in more contract announcements for Lockheed.Northrop Grumman (NOC)United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.Source: viper-zero / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) pays a quarterly dividend of $1.73 a share. Besides earning an income, shareholders have assurances from its 4-year trailing book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times. The strong backlog enabled Northrop to raise its sales outlook from 4% to 5% in 2023.This defense stock benefits from the urgent need for new capabilities in the B-21 and the Sentinel. Northrop is working with its customers to deliver those products on schedule. The timing to meet a tight timeline is critical when deterring aggression around the world.After Russia invaded Ukraine, customers reviewed their defense needs. They required a re-stockpiling of current weapons. They also invested in capabilities that Northrop could provide.Shareholders are investing in a company that is balancing the strong backlog growth in research and development. It is assuring its technology advancements by increasing R&amp;D and capital expenditures by 7.5% this year.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) expects strong demand ahead. It has a long product cycle, which lets it invest around $5 billion in capital expenditure and research.Raytheon will thrive as governments spend more on National defense and national security. They need modern next-generation space ground systems to get ahead of the enemy. They also need less advanced technical solutions that Raytheon may provide. For example, Blue Canyon Technologies will offer low-earth-orbit.Raytheon shares will benefit from the DoD raising its priority on fighter jets. This includes both the F135 and F-35. To protect its competitive positioning and market share, it has an F-135 engine core upgrade that increases its range by improving fuel burn rates. Pratt’s F-35 engine core upgrade will enter service by 2028.In the aerospace segment, demand for small engines will lift the Pratt business. In the commercial plane market, it has 10,000 engines between the V2500 and the GTF engine.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

29,b9e54fad-afeb-3057-80c2-4cb6a50a71fe,NEE,2023-03-19,ChatGPT Says These 7 Stocks Could Be the Next Trillion-Dollar Companies,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-says-7-stocks-could-165121012.html,1678899081,STORY,"['AAPL', 'NVDA', 'MRNA', 'TSLA', 'NEE-PR', 'AMZN']","[Investors will always be on the hunt for the next trillion-dollar companies. This is a milestone that every company aims for, though very few reach. For investors, this means constantly being on the lookout for innovators with revolutionary products that can take them to market capitalizations above $1 trillion.As InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango notes, in 2022, the iPhone helped Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reach that milestone and become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap above $2 trillion. Plenty of experts have made predictions as to what the next trillion-dollar whale will be. But I wanted to hear what ChatGPT has to say about it.Very much a revolutionary product itself, ChatGPT has proven apt at many things, including researching any number of topics and providing detailed information on them. This includes investing and stock selection. As InvestorPlace Financial News Writer Brenden Rearick reports:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“InvestorPlace has tasked ChatGPT time and again with selecting high-growth assets across the stock market and crypto world. The chatbot, while not necessarily up-to-date on stock market news, possesses a keen quantitative analysis skill…”With this in mind, I tasked ChatGPT with identifying the next trillion-dollar company. While the chatbot can’t make direct predictions, it did provide me with a list of companies that it thinks have the potential to reach the trillion-dollar mark. When first asked, it named the sectors that it sees as having trillion-dollar potential: artificial intelligence, healthcare technology, electric and autonomous vehicles, fintech and renewable energy. A few questions later, it named companies from each one that it saw as having the best potential.Let’s take a look at what ChatGPT thinks will be the next trillion-dollar companies.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWith a market cap of $970 billion, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is dangerously close to hitting $1 trillion. ChatGPT touts the e-commerce giant for its wide-range applications across many sectors. It specifically highlights Amazon’s recent investments in AI and robotics, making it clear that it sees this emerging market as the company’s ticket to a trillion-dollar valuation. This includes a recent partnership with AI startup Hugging Face, which offers Amazon exposure to a lucrative new section of the AI field. As the bot states:Story continues“As the company continues to expand into new markets, such as healthcare and advertising, and invest in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics, it could potentially continue to grow and reach a $1 trillion valuation.”NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comChatGPT clearly recognizes the power and potential of the renewable energy sector. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the field’s leaders, with vast holdings and an impressive market share. ChatGPT definitely sees it as a great play among clean energy companies. As it states:“NextEra Energy is already one of the world’s largest producers of wind and solar power, and its focus on renewable energy and sustainability could help it continue to grow and reach a $1 trillion valuation.”Additionally, the company is ranked as a winner among dividend stocks and carries significant appeal for less risk-averse investors. All this bodes well for its future as a potential trillion-dollar winner.Moderna (MRNA)The Moderna (MRNA) logo surrounded by syringes, pills and disposable face masks.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) enjoyed a race to the top during the Covid-19 vaccine rush, securing its place among pharmaceutical winners. Now, ChatGPT believes it has trillion-dollar potential due to its applications in healthcare technology. While the bot did not get specific in its reasoning, it provided the following breakdown:“Moderna is a biotechnology company that has gained significant attention and market value during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its successful development of an mRNA vaccine. As the company continues to develop and commercialize other mRNA-based treatments, it could potentially reach a $1 trillion valuation.”It’s also worth noting that ChatGPT considers MRNA to be a meme stock. When Rearick asked it for a list of the best meme stocks to buy, its top 10 picks included Moderna. That said, this categorization is likely due to 2021 data, as during that year the stock made many headlines.Nvidia (NVDA)An Nvidia (NVDA) semiconductor chip on a black background.Source: Hairem / Shutterstock.comIt’s not surprising that this AI standout would be ranked among future trillion-dollar winners. A Silicon Valley darling with wide-ranging applications, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is often noted for its potential to help power the AI boom. When I asked ChatGPT for a list of the best AI stocks to buy, it ranked Nvidia among its top picks, second only to actual trillion-dollar company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). This time around, it provided a detailed breakdown of why it sees Nvidia reaching the same level:“Nvidia is a leading semiconductor and graphics processing unit (GPU) company that has been on a steady growth trajectory in recent years, with a current market capitalization of around $500 billion. There are several reasons why some analysts and investors believe that Nvidia has the potential to reach a $1 trillion valuation in the future.”These reasons included “dominance in the AI and data center markets,” “diversification into new markets,” and high investor confidence as well as impressive financials. Nvidia’s market cap is actually $586 billion, a reminder that ChatGPT’s data is limited to 2021 and earlier. However, the rest of the reasoning holds up.Illumina (ILMN)Phot of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effectSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageThis name isn’t as well-known as the other stocks that ChatGPT named as potential trillion-dollar winners. But that doesn’t mean investors should count Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) out. As InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer notes, the biotech company is a leader in the field of gene sequencing, which he describes as a “key to unlocking precision medicine.” ChatGPT has a similar take, citing multiple reasons to be bullish on ILMN. As it states:“Illumina is a leading company in the genomics and genetic testing space, providing genetic sequencing and analysis solutions to researchers, clinicians, and biotech companies. There are several factors that could contribute to the company’s growth potential.”The chatbot highlights the company’s history of innovation while also naming “increasing demand for genetic testing” and “expansion into new markets” as factors for why it sees so much potential, as well as its focus on partnerships and diversification of products.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comIt’s no surprise that such a popular company would be on this list, especially after ChatGPT named electric and autonomous vehicles as a top opportunity. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considered a leader in both fields.While its autonomous driving technology has come under fire after multiple accidents, it remains firmly ahead of many competitors. Additionally, it still has its place at the front of the EV race, even as competitors close in. As InvestorPlace contributor Bret Kenwell reports, Tesla has already been in the trillion-dollar club and it could get there again. ChatGPT has a similar perspective. Per the bot:“Tesla is currently the largest automaker by market capitalization, with a market cap [near] $600 billion. As the company continues to expand its electric vehicle production and autonomous driving capabilities, it could potentially reach a $1 trillion valuation.”Block (SQ)Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.comConstantly hailed as a winner in the fintech space, Block (NYSE:SQ) has emerged as a mobile payments leader. Led by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the company is recovering from a volatile year. But this isn’t the first time that ChatGPT has selected it as a stock with significant growth potential. InvestorPlace Assistant News Writer Shrey Dua recently asked the bot for a list of tech stocks with high five-year growth potential. It ranked Block just below Nvidia on a list that included Apple and Amazon. Here’s what it told me about SQ stock:“[Block] has been on a steady growth trajectory since its founding in 2009 and has already reached a market capitalization of over $100 billion. With its focus on innovative financial solutions for small businesses, the company could potentially continue to grow and reach a $1 trillion valuation.”As a result of its difficult 2022, Block no longer boasts such a high market cap. As of this writing, it sits at $43 billion. If markets turn around in 2023, though, SQ could easily make up the ground it has lost.On the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn.Christopher Hohn is a British billionaire and hedge fund manager known for his charitable work and huge donations, as well as his brutal activist campaigns. Hohn founded The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) in 2003. Hohn had pledged to donate 50 basis points of the management fee to The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a charitable fund founded by Hohn and his ex-wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn. The foundation’s primary goal is to transform the lives of children and adolescents. It’s also working for several other causes, including climate, sexual &amp; reproductive health and to improve the lives of girls all over the world.In addition to his charity, what sets Hohn apart from other hedge fund managers is his laser-focused and often stubborn approach in activist investing. TCI Fund Management posted profits for 13-straight years through 2021. The fund lost money in 2022 as it fell by 18%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report, which cited a person with knowledge of the matter, said the fund lost money due to its huge bets on Alphabet and Microsoft. Shares of major tech companies fell in 2022 as investors fled growth stocks and found refuge in value and dividend plays.Chris Hohn's Latest Activist CampaignsUnlike several other major hedge funds, Hohn’s fund is highly concentrated in a few stocks. This makes the hedge fund vulnerable when the overall market declines. Despite this, Hohn has been relentless in pushing companies to make fundamental changes and improve their performance. One of his recent targets is Alphabet. Back in November, Hohn penned a letter to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, asking the executive to take “aggressive action” to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.Story continuesWhat makes this letter interesting is that it was written before Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) came under immense pressure amid the AI threats following the launch of ChatGPT and before analysts and investors started openly criticizing the company for over-hiring. Ultimately, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) had to accept the reality as the company announced to lay off thousands of jobs earlier this year.However, Chris Hohn is still not happy.In another letter to Sundar Pichai on January 20, Hohn said that while he likes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management is finally doing something to right size the company’s overgrown size and costs, the 12,000 job cuts “do not even reverse the very strong headcount growth of 2022.”Hohn said that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management will “ultimately need to go further.”Hohn also said that the median salary at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is too high and he believes the company is now in a position to decrease its salaries since the competition for talent in the industry has fallen significantly.Earlier in February, billionaire Hohn wrote a letter to Airbus (AIR.PA), in which TCI has a $4.3 billion stake. The billionaire said he was writing to “urge you to immediately terminate"" negotiations with Atos over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian. Hohn said that investing in Evidian would be “value destructive” and he believes Evidian “is a low-quality, highly levered company, with 60,000 employees, operating in an extremely competitive market.”That’s not the first time Hohn used the word “value destructive” in his letter. In 2021, the hedge fund manager had asked Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) to drop its bid for Kansas City Southern. Hohn said that the deal faced significant regulatory hurdles and a decision to create a voting trust “would be hugely value destructive”.The company went ahead with the deal that ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles, just as Hohn had warned in his letter. Giving in to the huge pressure from Hohn, Canadian National announced in October 2021 that its CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest will leave the company as soon as January.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris HohnChris Hohn Hohn's Climate ActivismChris Hohn’s activism also addresses the climate change problem. And unlike other fund managers who are happy with just publishing yearly climate reports and talking ESG scores, Hohn has a no non-sense approach when it comes to ESG as he believes most of the activism in the climate space is not producing any results.Hohn, who donates to Extinction Rebellion, said at the Bloomberg Intelligence ESG Investment Forum in London in May 2022 that ESG engagement is not producing any meaningful results.“We should stop pretending and just be honest. The acid test is actual emissions, are they falling or are they rising? And they’re rising. And that’s where the rubber hits the road.” We picked the top 10 stocks from Chris Hohn’s fourth quarter of 2022 portfolio for this article.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Chris Hohn sold over 5 million shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) during the fourth quarter of 2022, ending the period with just 5,191 shares of the company, which were worth about $1.1 million. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022,  83 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), down from 74 funds in the previous quarter.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital Management specifically said about Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a large railroad company that carries freight across the western US and between Canada and Mexico. It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, TCI Fund Management reported owning about $35.12 million worth of stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) via 67,770 shares. In February, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, which was a 16.7% increase from the previous dividend. The dividend is payable on April 14 to shareholders of record as of March 15.Polen Capital made the following comment about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a leader in attractive end markets with a skilled management team who has demonstrated the ability to consistently and wisely allocate capital. It is the world leader in serving science. It is a globally scaled supplier serving more than 400,000 customers working within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, research institutions, and government agencies. Thermo provides many of the products and services that companies in these industries, particularly pharma and biotech, need to operate and drive science forward. The company manufactures and sells instruments, reagents, and consumables used for a wide range of applications in labs.Sales are also well balanced geographically, including leading scale in emerging markets, according to our research.The business meets all our financial guardrails. We view Thermo Fisher as an extremely durable business, and we expect mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth over the long term. With expanding margins and wise capital deployment, we expect mid-teens underlying earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.We also think Thermo Fisher’s business would be very durable in an economic downturn as pharma and biotech customers account for roughly 60% of the company’s sales today and roughly 80% of sales are highly recurring consumables and services. Thermo received a COVID boost as they supply COVID PCR tests as well as some products used in the production of COVID vaccines. As such, it is in the process of growing over that excess demand. We expect the company to move past this growth headwind by the back half of 2023. At approximately 24x our estimate for nexttwelve-months earnings per share, we believe Thermo’s valuation is attractive for this type of consistent, well-managed, and durable business.”8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 209Chris Hohn owns about 15.9 million Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Overall, 209 hedge funds out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.In February, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald said in an interview on CNBC that he believes the AI hype has created opportunities for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The analyst acknowledged that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing some threats in the market and the launch of its chatbot was underwhelming but he still believes the AI deployment is possible without disrupting Google's core business.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our biggest detractors in Q4 included communication services sector holdings Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). For Alphabet, Google’s parent company, growth has decelerated as advertisers have pulled back on digital ad spend following a COVID-driven acceleration as well as due to economic uncertainties. Longer term, Alphabet remains well positioned to win in multiple ways, whether in search, online video or in the cloud. We continue to see large profit pools for Alphabet in the early stages of monetization, along with the migration of advertising dollars away from traditional mediums, like TV, to online search and video. These factors give us confidence Alphabet continues to have a long runway to grow revenue and profits. Additionally, management has returned capital to shareholders— another lever that can be used to increase the per share value of the business. We view Alphabet as one of the best businesses in the world, capable of expanding revenues at an above-average rate for years to come, with a bulletproof balance sheet and an average asking price. It’s a name we’ve held since 2015, and we believe Alphabet will continue to be a strong compounder of value in the future.”7. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s shares have gained about 6% year to date. For the fourth quarter, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) posted adjusted EPS of $1.60, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue in the quarter fell 16.2% on a YoY basis to $1.29 billion but beat estimates by $20 million. For 2023, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) expects its revenue to increase in the mid-to-high-single-digit percent range. Adjusted EPS is expected to come in the range of $9 to $9.50 versus the consensus of $9.28.Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management owns a $2.5 billion stake in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, as the hedge fund upped its stake in the company by 12% in the period. Overall, out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), down from 63 hedge funds in the previous quarter.6. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn. Recently, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) posted its Q4 results that beat analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.54, beating Wall Street estimate of $2.48. Reported revenue in the period came in at $2.94 billion, crushing past the analyst estimate of $2.88 billion.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 97 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI). The total value of these stakes was $7.8 billion. Chris Hohn is the biggest stakeholder of S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), followed by William Von Mueffling's Cantillon Capital Management which owns a $696 million stake in the firm.Andvari Associates made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for Beginners10 Mad Money Stock Picks This WeekDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
31,fe5c99c5-1834-3deb-977d-22d208d0dc9c,MA,2023-03-19,11 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-most-undervalued-gold-stocks-153113339.html,1679153473,STORY,"['HG=F', 'SI=F', 'GC=F', 'SSRM', 'NGD', 'BTG']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 11 most undervalued gold stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Gold is almost always in the spotlight as investors tend to flock to the precious metal amid geopolitical unrest, rising inflation, recession fears, and other uncertainties. Ever since the stock market turmoil started on the back of rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s subsequent rate-hike spree, investors have been keeping gold stocks on their radar.In December 2022, Juerg Kiener, managing director and chief investment officer of Swiss Asia Capital, said in an interview with CNBC that gold prices could reach between $2500 to $4000 sometime in 2023. The analyst said at the time that he was expecting a mild recession in the first quarter of 2023, which would cause many central banks to slow the pace of interest rate hikes and make gold even more attractive.The analyst also said that if inflation persists, gold will gain more traction all over the world because the analyst thinks it’s a “good inflation hedge, a great catch during stagflation and a great add onto a portfolio.”After strong jobs report and signs that inflation is not declining in the US, the rally in gold prices that we saw during the start of the year collapsed as investors expect the Federal Reserve to continue its rate hikes. When interest rates rise, investors cling to yield as gold doesn’t pay anything. A stronger dollar is also making it difficult for foreign investors to buy gold. Near the end of 2022 analysts were predicting that gold will make a strong recovery in 2023 based on their expectations that inflation will fall and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate hikes. But those expectations fell flat. But gold price is now on the rise ever since the banking sector started wavering. Some analysts hope that the Federal Reserve can put brakes on its rate-hike spree to avoid more problems for the banking sector. On March 17, spot gold jumped about 3.1% to $1,977.89 per ounce, which was its highest level since April 2022. U.S. gold futures also jumped 2.6% to settle at $1,973.50 as of March 17.Story continuesAnother latest catalyst for gold prices came when the ECB went ahead with rates hikes despite the latest crisis in the banking industry. The decision of the ECB caused the euro to gain and the dollar to lose value, ultimately helping gold prices. Analysts believe the latest cracks in the banking system have caused investors to yet again flee to gold, the ultimate safe haven asset.The latest market situation does provide an opportunity for long-term investors to pile into gold stocks that are currently undervalued.Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top 11 gold stocks with PE ratios less than 20 as of February 24 that have the highest number of hedge fund investors.

SSR Mining’s stock has fallen significantly this year due to lower precious metal prices and the temporary closure of its Copler mine. We repurchased its shares in late September after the Copler mine restarted on schedule, since the stock remained depressed. SSR Mining should generate significant free cash flow at current gold and silver prices and has a very strong balance sheet with over $600 million in net cash and $4.1 billion in stockholders’ equity. While we expect the stock to remain volatile, we believe the company is selling at an attractive price relative to its asset-heavy balance sheet and our net asset valuation.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now10 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now30 Most Famous Yale Students of All TimeDisclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Gold Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It also translates to $1.5 billion in sales for Lockheed in the second half of this year.Lockheed is one of the best defense stocks to own because orders keep rising. It will realize higher revenue when it fulfills orders with deliveries, probably in late 2024 into 2025.CFO Malave said that Turkey wants to buy more F-16s. This would lead to additional orders of up to 300 aircraft. India is interested in F-21s, creating an opportunity for Lockheed Martin. Investors should look for governments planning to spend more on the military. This will result in more contract announcements for Lockheed.Northrop Grumman (NOC)United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.Source: viper-zero / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) pays a quarterly dividend of $1.73 a share. Besides earning an income, shareholders have assurances from its 4-year trailing book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times. The strong backlog enabled Northrop to raise its sales outlook from 4% to 5% in 2023.This defense stock benefits from the urgent need for new capabilities in the B-21 and the Sentinel. Northrop is working with its customers to deliver those products on schedule. The timing to meet a tight timeline is critical when deterring aggression around the world.After Russia invaded Ukraine, customers reviewed their defense needs. They required a re-stockpiling of current weapons. They also invested in capabilities that Northrop could provide.Shareholders are investing in a company that is balancing the strong backlog growth in research and development.

It has a long product cycle, which lets it invest around $5 billion in capital expenditure and research.Raytheon will thrive as governments spend more on National defense and national security. They need modern next-generation space ground systems to get ahead of the enemy. They also need less advanced technical solutions that Raytheon may provide. For example, Blue Canyon Technologies will offer low-earth-orbit.Raytheon shares will benefit from the DoD raising its priority on fighter jets. This includes both the F135 and F-35. To protect its competitive positioning and market share, it has an F-135 engine core upgrade that increases its range by improving fuel burn rates. Pratt’s F-35 engine core upgrade will enter service by 2028.In the aerospace segment, demand for small engines will lift the Pratt business. In the commercial plane market, it has 10,000 engines between the V2500 and the GTF engine.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nick joins Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Garfinkle from SXSW in Austin, TX to discuss how health technology like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is easing the burden of managing diabetes.Watch as Nick opens up about his partnership with DexCom (DXCM), fatherhood, and his struggle with diabetes.Video TranscriptNICK JONAS: When I look back on my early life living with diabetes, I didn't see it a whole lot of places. And there wasn't a big conversation around it-- or if there was, there was a lot of misunderstandings. And to be able to be a part of that awareness and educational aspect of it really means a lot to me, and to be able to speak about some of these topics that are I think so important and on top of mind for all of us.- And for you, what role has tech played in your diabetes management? It sounds like it's been pretty important.NICK JONAS: Has been. I've been wearing a Dexcom CGM for years now. And it's incredible to see from my early days of living with the disease back when I was 13 to kind of where we are now and how far things have come, even just in that 17 year period-- it's really encouraging. And you know, I'm basically able to live my life in a way more free way because I have the ability to see those numbers in real time and make those changes I might need to make to live that healthier and happier life.- Well, and it seems like you've really seen the technology evolve over time.NICK JONAS: I certainly have. In those 17 years, so much has changed. And yet, awareness about the technology is still, I think, so low.- Well, one of the things you mentioned earlier that is your experience with diabetes was a lot about learning, trial and error. Do you think better technology can help make that process easier for people who are, say, diagnosed with type 1 now when they're really young?Story continuesNICK JONAS: Yeah. I think that whether it's diabetes management or just generally living in the world we're in today, that access to information and having it literally in the palm of your hand, I think, is an amazing tool, whether it's the internet or CGM. In this case for me, it's CGM.And there was a lot of early learning I had to do kind of just by way of, as you said, trial and error and figuring things out, back when I was pricking my finger 10 to 12 times a day. Which, on top of the obvious physical agony of that, there's the frustration of knowing that it's a really unpredictable disease and even if you're taking the best care you think you can be for yourself, if you're testing so infrequently, then there's going to be times where there's trouble spots along the way. And so I feel really encouraged by that and by the growing conversation around all the other diabetes related topics that we were able to speak about today.- Did you ever have a Eureka moment, the first moment where you were like, oh my god, this tech can actually help me? Do you remember the first time?NICK JONAS: There's been a few times. And we did a whole thing around the last Super Bowl commercial around kind of magic moments. And one of mine as it relates to this and Dexcom was just the many times that I've been backstage before a show and I see the little arrow pointing down. And I know that in 20 minutes time when I'm right in the middle of one of our songs, I'm going to have a low blood sugar crash.And I've got a really supportive group of friends, and family, and team members on the road that are all aware of it and kind of know what to do in those different situations. So I feel really supported. And I know that not a lot of people do. They don't want to open that circle up too wide, because it's a really personal thing. But I think that as much as someone is comfortable, it's really helpful to lean on the people that love you to support you through what is a pretty intense disease.- So as we're winding down, I'd actually love to ask you, do you have any financial advice that you want to impart to your daughter? Is there any financial advice you've gotten that you've been really excited about or remembered?NICK JONAS: You know, I'm just trying to figure out how to be a dad at this point. So the financial advice, I need a few more years to wrap my head around that. But I think--- She's not walking out with a credit card?NICK JONAS: Quite simply, just save. It's really important to save. I think that will always age well.]"

Instead, keep your eyes on the long-term, with solid additions to your portfolio, such as the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold.These high-quality names have historically provided investors with solid total returns. First, through steady dividend payouts that grow over time. Most of these top blue-chips are “dividend aristocrats,” with over 25 years of consecutive dividend growth. Some of them are even “dividend kings,” with dividend growth track records spanning 50 years or more.Second, along with these dividends, these types of stocks gradually appreciate in value over time. You may not get rich quickly with them, but over an extended timeframe, you have the opportunity to build wealth. So, what are the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the coming decades? Consider these seven, all of which are safe harbors in the near-term, solid winners for your portfolio in the long-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADPAutomatic Data Processing$212.33CINFCincinnati Financial$105.90JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$153.29LMTLockheed Martin$466.52MDTMedtronic$77.62PEPPepsiCo$175.02UNHUnitedHealth$461.25Automatic Data Processing (ADP)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is best known as being the world’s largest payroll processor. Given that, in good times and bad times, employers need to meet payroll, ADP is a steady, recession-resistant business.Thanks to this consistency, it’s no wonder ADP stock is on the verge of becoming a dividend aristocrat. The company has raised its dividend payout 24 years in a row. Shares today have a forward yield of 2.34%. While this may not sound high, over the past five years, this rate of payout has grown by an average of 13.8% annually.Investors who have long held ADP, and have reinvested these payouts into additional shares, have generated strong returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results, but per dqydj.com’s stock return calculator, ADP has generated total annualized returns of 10.8% over the past 25 years.Story continuesCincinnati Financial (CINF)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockCincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) may not be one of the best-known property and casualty insurers, but among insurers, it may be for some investors one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. Admittedly, CINF stock has only slightly beaten the market over a long time frame. Over the past 25 years, CINF has produced annualized total returns of around 7.5%, whereas the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested), has produced annualized returns of 7.2% during this time frame.However, while perhaps not a standout choice for capital growth, CINF is a great choice for dividend-focused investors. As SureDividend.com has pointed out, CINF is one of just 13 stocks that has raised its dividend more than 60 years in a row. With a current forward yield of 2.7%. The company has raised this payout by an average of 6.65% over the past five years.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Source: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another of the blue-chips sporting a dividend growth track record of at least sixty years. The recession and inflation-resistant nature of JNJ’s diversified health care business has enabled it to achieve this in prior decades. The company is poised to continue with this tradition during today’s challenging times, as well as in the decades to come. JNJ stock right now has a forward yield of 2.94%, and the company has grown its payout by an average of 6.11% annually over the past five years.Sure, JNJ’s near-term share price performance has been subpar. Yet while JNJ’s recent double-digit drop may at first seem concerning, this is likely to be just temporary. Trading at the low end of its historic valuation at 15 times earnings, forecasts calling for consistent earnings growth over the next two years point to shares getting back on track.Lockheed Martin (LMT)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWith only 20 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has yet to gain “dividend aristocrat” status. However, don’t assume that means that LMT isn’t one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. Given that the defense contractor’s dividend payout ratio is only 41.6%, there’s a good chance it continues to raise its payout over the next five years, which will then place LMT stock in the dividend aristocrats category. Shares today have a forward yield of 2.51%, and the payout has grown by an average of 8.71% annually for the past five years.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin’s business may now be even better-positioned to thrive in the coming years, and not just because of current conflicts such as Russia’s Ukraine invasion. With tensions between the U.S. and China rising, the Biden administration is looking to boost military hardware spending.Medtronic (MDT)Source: ShutterstockIf you’re looking for a blue-chip offering a moderately-higher yield, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) may be a great choice. Shares in the medical device maker, domiciled in Ireland but operating globally, currently have a forward dividend yield of 3.49%.MDT stock also has a 9-year track record of dividend growth. It may be more than a decade away from achieving “dividend aristocrat” status, but with payout growth averaging 8.1% annually over the past five years, more dividend increases may be in store. Yes, there have been some concerns about future earnings growth recently.However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator has recently argued, as near-term headwinds resolve, and management pivots to higher-growth segments of the industry, Medtronic could experience a growth resurgence. Besides enabling MDT to continue raising its payout, this may also result in multiple expansion for the stock, which today trades for only 14.8 times forward earnings.Pepsico (PEP)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockPepsico’s (NASDAQ:PEP) status as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy and hold is self-evident. With 50 years of dividend growth, PEP is a bona fide “dividend king.” Operating in the consumer staples sector, the company is able to generate steady earnings that keep up with inflation.PEP stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past 25 years, generating annualized total returns of 8.28% during this timeframe. More impressively, PEP’s 25-year performance has handily beat that of its main peer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Since 1998, KO stock has generated total annualized returns of just 4.47%. As I’ve argued before, PEP has KO beat when it comes to the sweetest cola stock to buy and hold. Although both trade at similar valuations, and KO offers a higher dividend yield (3.07% versus 2.65%), PEP has greater earnings and dividend growth potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockOver the past 25 years, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has delivered stunning returns to investors. Over this time frame, annualized returns for the health insurance and healthcare services giant have come in at 18.45%.Future returns may be more modest, but UNH stock still has a path to generate double-digit annualized returns from here. First, via earnings growth. Forecasts call for UNH’s earnings to rise by 17.7% this year and 13.5% next year. Assuming shares rise in tandem with earnings growth, this alone could generate double-digit gains.In addition, potential future returns for UnitedHealth Group keep rising, as the company becomes more of a dividend-payer. UNH’s forward yield may only be 1.42%, but this payout has grown by an average of 17.1% annually for the past five years. A low payout ratio (28.84%) points to more room for such high dividend growth.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Williams Companies with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies How Quickly Is Williams Companies Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes.

As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.8%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, TE Connectivity was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 20.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 28%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.24. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that TE Connectivity has grown earnings per share at 18% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for TE Connectivity's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

41,1781de4d-5e63-4b43-8853-7408c026bba4,WFC,2023-03-19,Why US regulators let banks lose billions — as long as losses are ‘unrealized’,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-us-regulators-let-banks-lose-billions--as-long-as-losses-are-unrealized-124755456.html,1679230075,STORY,"['BAC', 'JPM', 'WFC', 'BAC-PQ', 'BAC-PS']","[Silicon Valley Bank disclosed it had $1.8 billion in paper losses on some bonds at the end of 2022.And yet the lender didn't reduce a key measure of capital strength monitored by regulators. Those losses became existential for the bank once it was forced to sell these assets, triggering a run that ended with the bank's seizure on March 10.The U.S. banking system currently has hundreds of billions in unrealized losses lurking in its system that don't weaken buffers designed to protect banks from future shocks. Why would regulators allow that?The short answer: Compromise.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Years ago, U.S. supervisors decided most small and mid-sized institutions could opt out of deducting paper losses on bonds from key regulatory capital levels. In essence, these banks are allowed to report assets that are stronger in theory than they would be in practice. As Silicon Valley Bank — and the broader investing public — found out earlier this month.Giant banks, however, don't have this option as a result of post-2008 banking reforms, but they have another way to ensure sudden changes in the value of their securities don't harm capital levels required by regulators: They can shift bonds from one internal accounting category to another.A sign for a Silicon Valley Bank private branch is displayed in San Francisco, Tuesday, March 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)'A good compromise'The debate about these paper losses started three decades ago with an accounting change that gripped the banking world.A 1993 rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board required companies to begin classifying the fair market values of debt securities in particular ways. Any bonds they intended to hold until maturity would be routed to a classification called ""hold for maturity,"" while bonds that could be sold sooner would go in a category called ""available for sale.""Any declines in the latter category would show up in a bank's public disclosures for anyone to see, but they wouldn't count as a loss against earnings until the deteriorating assets were actually sold.Story continuesBanks worried they would be punished by overseers if these paper losses mounted on their massive holdings of bonds. Their fears were reinforced by an early proposal from the FDIC requiring banks to lower key regulatory capital ratios if unrealized bond losses emerged in the available-for-sale category. Bankers pushed back, and the FDIC agreed in 1995 regulatory ratios would not suffer from declines in the value of debt securities. (Equities still had to be counted.)""This approach is deemed proper,"" the regulator said in a ruling that year, citing potential volatility that unrealized losses could pose as ""interest rates change."" When rates rise, the value of existing bonds tend to decline.Former FDIC Chair Bill Isaac, who is now chair of Secura/Isaac Group, said it was ""a good compromise,"" adding: ""[You] can't force banks to mark to market. Then they cannot be long term lenders.""Former FDIC examiner Allen Puwalski views it differently.""It was a mistake from the beginning,"" he said. A different approach ""would have stopped some of what happened. Banks would have known this is going to hit my regulatory capital."" The FDIC declined to comment.A capital bufferWhat is regulatory capital and why is it so important?Capital, also known as ""equity,"" is what allows a bank to absorb any changes in the value of its assets and survive unexpected shocks. It is the literal difference between a bank's assets (cash, loans and investments) and its liabilities (deposits and other forms of funding).Regulators require banks to keep key capital ratios above certain thresholds. These ratios go up if a bank earns more profits and down if it loses money on loans or investments.If these ratios aren't high enough, the thinking goes, a bank could run into serious problems during times of stress. Regulators, as a result, use them to issue warnings and take corrective action.Whether these measures of strength should be affected by unrealized bond losses surfaced again in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis when an international consortium, operating under the name Basel III, proposed paper losses on ""available for sale"" securities be deducted from a bank's regulatory capital levels. Specifically, a measure known as common equity Tier 1 capital.American regulators considered adopting this proposal and faced pushback from banks and some public officials. Their compromise? The rule would apply only to banks with more than $250 billion in assets while smaller banks could opt out. Regulators moved the bar higher in 2019 to only encompass banks with more than $700 billion in assets.Giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), or Wells Fargo (WFC) are too big to opt out of this reporting scheme.Instead these banks are able to shift securities from ""available for sale"" to ""hold to maturity,"" a classification that means unrealized losses won't affect a bank's regulatory capital ratios. Most bonds held by Bank of America are now in that bucket, for instance — at the end of 2022, its unrealized losses on those holdings were just shy of $109 billion.President Joe Biden speaks about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)'Once the horse has left the barn'Some of these practices may change after the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, which like many banks opted out of deducting paper losses from regulatory capital ratios.The Federal Reserve may, according to reporting in The Wall Street Journal, propose changes in the coming months that require more banks to end this practice. Across all U.S. banks, unrealized losses had ballooned to $620 billion at the end of 2022.""The rationale for lenient capital treatment has always centered around the idea that interest rates movements would create artificial volatility in bank capital,"" said Puwalski, a former partner with hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. and chief investment officer at Cybiont Capital. ""What we've just experienced is that liquidity shocks can prove the fact that it's not artificial at all.""Bank supervisors, he added, ""have had at least two opportunities to get the accounting treatment right"" in the 1990s and following the 2008 crisis. Now he expects regulators to act aggressively.""One thing [regulators] are good at,"" he said, is that ""once the horse has left the barn they really slam that door shut.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Nick joins Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Garfinkle from SXSW in Austin, TX to discuss how health technology like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is easing the burden of managing diabetes.Watch as Nick opens up about his partnership with DexCom (DXCM), fatherhood, and his struggle with diabetes.Video TranscriptNICK JONAS: When I look back on my early life living with diabetes, I didn't see it a whole lot of places. And there wasn't a big conversation around it-- or if there was, there was a lot of misunderstandings. And to be able to be a part of that awareness and educational aspect of it really means a lot to me, and to be able to speak about some of these topics that are I think so important and on top of mind for all of us.- And for you, what role has tech played in your diabetes management? It sounds like it's been pretty important.NICK JONAS: Has been. I've been wearing a Dexcom CGM for years now. And it's incredible to see from my early days of living with the disease back when I was 13 to kind of where we are now and how far things have come, even just in that 17 year period-- it's really encouraging. And you know, I'm basically able to live my life in a way more free way because I have the ability to see those numbers in real time and make those changes I might need to make to live that healthier and happier life.- Well, and it seems like you've really seen the technology evolve over time.NICK JONAS: I certainly have. In those 17 years, so much has changed. And yet, awareness about the technology is still, I think, so low.- Well, one of the things you mentioned earlier that is your experience with diabetes was a lot about learning, trial and error. Do you think better technology can help make that process easier for people who are, say, diagnosed with type 1 now when they're really young?Story continuesNICK JONAS: Yeah. I think that whether it's diabetes management or just generally living in the world we're in today, that access to information and having it literally in the palm of your hand, I think, is an amazing tool, whether it's the internet or CGM. In this case for me, it's CGM.And there was a lot of early learning I had to do kind of just by way of, as you said, trial and error and figuring things out, back when I was pricking my finger 10 to 12 times a day. Which, on top of the obvious physical agony of that, there's the frustration of knowing that it's a really unpredictable disease and even if you're taking the best care you think you can be for yourself, if you're testing so infrequently, then there's going to be times where there's trouble spots along the way. And so I feel really encouraged by that and by the growing conversation around all the other diabetes related topics that we were able to speak about today.- Did you ever have a Eureka moment, the first moment where you were like, oh my god, this tech can actually help me? Do you remember the first time?NICK JONAS: There's been a few times. And we did a whole thing around the last Super Bowl commercial around kind of magic moments. And one of mine as it relates to this and Dexcom was just the many times that I've been backstage before a show and I see the little arrow pointing down. And I know that in 20 minutes time when I'm right in the middle of one of our songs, I'm going to have a low blood sugar crash.And I've got a really supportive group of friends, and family, and team members on the road that are all aware of it and kind of know what to do in those different situations. So I feel really supported. And I know that not a lot of people do. They don't want to open that circle up too wide, because it's a really personal thing. But I think that as much as someone is comfortable, it's really helpful to lean on the people that love you to support you through what is a pretty intense disease.- So as we're winding down, I'd actually love to ask you, do you have any financial advice that you want to impart to your daughter? Is there any financial advice you've gotten that you've been really excited about or remembered?NICK JONAS: You know, I'm just trying to figure out how to be a dad at this point. So the financial advice, I need a few more years to wrap my head around that. But I think--- She's not walking out with a credit card?NICK JONAS: Quite simply, just save. It's really important to save. I think that will always age well.]"

DeMuro’s channel has over 4.6 million subscribers to date and his more popular videos garner millions of views each.DeMuro’s internet stardom hasn’t kept him from shunning other pursuits, as he dipped his toe into the startup world with his auction site Cars &amp; Bids, which focuses on classic cars from the modern era (typically the ‘80s and up).Cars &amp; Bids isn’t the first site focusing on car enthusiasts, but it has gained traction even in the face of steep competition from bigger auction sites like Bringatrailer.com. Its popularity led to new funding for expanding the business, with a big $37 million infusion coming from PE firm The Chernin Group.It wasn’t all smooth sailing though, at least at the start.“It's been harder than I expected, to be totally honest. I always tell people, if I had known it was going to be this difficult to run a business like this, I would have just started a podcast,” DeMuro joked during an interview with Yahoo Finance. “Of course we launched this business in June of 2020, we thought it was going to fail because it was COVID. But, actually, we launched into the greatest car market in the history of the automobile — so it all worked out okay.”Even in an era of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, and general economic unease, DuMuro said the used car market has done better than feared.“Obviously, things have slowed down from their very peak, which felt to me like the end of '21, beginning of '22, maybe the spring of '22,” DeMuro said, noting demand is still stronger than he was expecting.“I was thinking, as interest rates were rising throughout '22, cars would really start to slow down, people would start to maybe pull back on their purchases of these things. That hasn't really happened as much as I thought. Good stuff is still bringing good money,” he says.Story continuesEven in-person events, such as the big auctions taking place at the Amelia Island Concours over the weekend, jibe with DeMuro's observations, with auction houses seeing record sales. And Cars &amp; Bids is just riding the wave of high interest in classic and older cars, with Americans at least willing to spend some money to enjoy the car of their dreams, instead of just dreaming about it.Electrification and why ‘analog’ cars matterCars &amp; Bids founder Doug DeMuroCars &amp; Bids has many cars on the virtual offer-block, even newer EVs from Rivian (RIVN), Lucid (LCID), and Tesla (TSLA). As a longtime watcher of the car market, and one who’s tested hundreds of vehicles from classic muscle cars to EVs, DeMuro has some thoughts on electrification, especially Tesla and where the brand sits right now.“When Tesla first came out with the Model S 10 years ago— believe it or not, it's been over 10 years ago, now— it was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla. There was no possible way to catch up to Tesla; and in the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up,” he says.Tesla hasn’t come out with anything new or exciting recently, DeMuro says, and he suggests the company’s competitive advantage has “eroded fairly considerably.” Tesla’s CyberTruck is late, he says, and others like Rivian, Ford, have already jumped into the EV pickup wars.In DeMuro’s view, old stalwarts like Ford and GM are the most likely to catch and bring it to Tesla on the EV battlefield. “When you look at the Ford Mustang Mach-E, to me, that is a very competitive car with the Model Y. I think that General Motors and Ford are very committed to an electric vehicle strategy that is going to make them continually banging at Tesla's door over the next few years.”The electric race is on, and while Wall Street believes Tesla’s tech and software are still ahead, it seems the traditional competition is making a go of it - and DeMuro seems to think it might be better to bet on Detroit.However when shifting back to enthusiast cars, which are DeMuro’s speciality, he declined to place any “bets” on specific older cars that he expects to rise in value. It’s too tricky he says given how volatile the market is, though he did say one class of cars will stand out from the rest.“One segment that I will remain bullish on until probably years to come - analog cars,” DeMuro says. “As the world moves to electric vehicles, which I think are great for most people for daily transportation, I do think there's going to be a huge segment of the enthusiast world that's going to wish to have cars with manual transmissions, cars that have a big engine sound, cars that still feel like the old days - and I think analog cars that have those qualities are still going to continue to be desirable.”If anyone knows, it would be DeMuro.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Target’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Target Is Target Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Target’s ratio of 26.39x is above its peer average of 19.72x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Consumer Retailing industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Target’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Target generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 99% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Target. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TGT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe TGT should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TGT for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for TGT, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Target at this point in time.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.Financial markets are currently wavering following the SVB collapse and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s roadmap to tame inflation. Some analysts believe the central bank could pause interest rate hikes to stop a possible crisis spillover in the banking sector. But others question how the Fed would be able to tame inflation if it pauses its interest rate hikes? Only time would tell could be the right answer since experts have been proven wrong time and again given the unprecedented nature of the crisis we are seeing in the markets where history is no longer a guide.However, when it comes to dividend stocks, history does provide some guidance. Data shows that when markets are going through turmoil and recession is around the corner, dividend growth stocks provide a solid refuge to investors. An S&amp;P Global report said that companies that have a strong track record of growing their dividends provide investors a chance to have exposure to “high-quality stocks and greater income over time, therefore buffering against market volatility and addressing the risk of rising rates to some extent.”One of the most important reasons why investing in dividend growth stocks seems worthwhile is the buffer against volatility that comes with having an exposure to these stocks. The S&amp;P Global report said that during Dec. 31, 1999 to March 31, 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 and S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index by an average of 140 bps per month and 49 bps per month, respectively, during down market cycles.A detailed research report by Raymond James also mentions several data points highlighting the performance of dividend stocks during recessionary periods. The report, titled “Investment Strategies for Recessionary Periods,” says that for investors who are increasingly sensitive to market fluctuations” and want to “proactively manage volatility,” high quality fixed-income and dividend-producing equity investments are suitable as they have historically shown resilience during recessionary environments.Story continuesMost Promising Dividend Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used the Finviz stock screener to find stocks with dividend yields over 2% whose average analyst price estimates are at least 30% above their current stock prices.

Private equity firms had very strong years in 2020 and 2021 as investors recognized the attractiveness of the business model. They bid up multiples to unattractive levels. Then as the bear market of 2022 unfolded, investors pulled away from the stocks of private equity firms due to the firm’s equity exposure.

(NASDAQ:MAR) At US$159?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-marriott-international-inc-nasdaq-135648145.html,1679147808,STORY,['MAR'],"[Let's talk about the popular Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$181 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$146. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Marriott International's current trading price of US$159 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Marriott International’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International Is Marriott International Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Marriott International seems to be fairly priced at around 4.8% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Marriott International today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $166.74, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Marriott International’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Marriott International?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 27% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Marriott International. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? MAR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MAR, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

The report suggests that inflation is cooling at a moderate pace, and the market is now pricing anywhere from a pause to a 25 basis-point hike at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting.In contrast, the current inflation rate at 6% does remain much higher than the Federal Reserve’s long-term 2% goal. Thus, it may take some time for lagging sectors, such as shelter inflation, to bring down the overall rate gradually. The banking sector remains volatile, but various Federal “bailouts” have effectively contained any contagion risk within regional banks. Moreover, energy prices are back to pre-pandemic levels, with the price of crude oil declining. The economy seems to be on the right track.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, here are three stocks to buy for those expecting inflation to continue to fall from here.AMZNAmazon$94.74GOOGAlphabet$95.28SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$78.76Amazon (AMZN)What Would Happen to Amazon Stock If AWS Was Spun Off?Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.comCooling inflation is solid news for Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) e-commerce business. Once consumers have room for more discretionary spending, e-commerce consumption will pick up. Indeed, Amazon is the leading player in this industry, and coupled with its fast-growing cloud segment, AMZN stock will likely deliver robust gains in a dis-inflationary environment.The company’s CFO perfectly summarizes why inflation hits Amazon hard: “In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty, and softlines.”Story continuesThus, with purchasing power coming back, Amazon can take its margins higher. Its current stock price, at less than $95 per share, is a bargain when you consider the potential profits it will generate in a few years.Alphabet (GOOG)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is another business that has suffered under high inflation. Marketing is among the easiest expenses to cut back on when times are tough, and we have seen that happen over the past year. Almost all businesses felt the margin pinch, and started to cut back on expansion, with the focus shifting to profitability. These marketing cuts directly impacted Alphabet’s advertising business, which accounts for a massive 80.2% of its revenue.Even worse, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is contesting Google’s search dominance by integrating ChatGPT into its search engine. Google then made a blunder by rushing the release of Bard, and its share price took a dive.Despite that, things are starting to look up for Alphabet. The ad market is beginning to show signs of stability as businesses recover. The Bing-ChatGPT integration also hasn’t meaningfully changed the status quo yet, as almost everyone is accustomed to using Google.Furthermore, Alphabet is changing hands at a price-earnings ratio of 20-times. This is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to snap up the discounted stock before more businesses pump up the marketing spend.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is turning a corner after a 64%-plus decline from mid-2021 levels. The greatest news for the company is the decline in commodity price levels and the increase in infrastructure spending. Inflation that has driven up commodity prices is a headache for the company. That’s because Stanley Black &amp; Decker is a leader in manufacturing construction tools, a segment that has been booming of late due to the $1 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure bill. However, with high raw material prices, Stanley Black &amp; Decker could not maximize profitability in its tools business. It will be a completely different case in a few months as inflation cools.The company’s CEO stated,“Our margins were significantly impacted by inflation, and when we chose to prioritize inventory reductions by lowering manufacturing production levels in this last four to five months of 2022, this was to allow us to generate solid free cash flow as we experienced in the fourth quarter. These negative profitability impacts resulted in a full year adjusted diluted earnings per share being down year-over-year to $4.62.”For 2023, Stanley Black &amp; Decker expects $500 million to $1 billion in free cash flow this year. Additionally, the company expects gross margins to improve to the mid-to-high 20% range from the current 20% level seen in the last two quarters of the year. The stock has significant upside potential considering its current price-earnings ratio of nearly 12-times.Finally, it also has a 3.94% forward dividend yield with 55 consecutive years of dividend increases. There’s a lot to like about this potential beneficiary of declining inflation.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Is Air Products and Chemicals Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 27.05x is currently well-above the industry average of 11.92x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Furthermore, Air Products and Chemicals’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach levels around its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What does the future of Air Products and Chemicals look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.66bUS$2.89bUS$3.08bUS$3.23bUS$3.35bUS$3.47bUS$3.57bUS$3.67bUS$3.76bUS$3.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x5Est @ 4.77%Est @ 3.96%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 3.00%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.52%Est @ 2.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$83bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$83b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$43bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$66b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$72.2, the company appears about fair value at a 9.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

62,de095596-e822-3a16-af2c-27e352045aa5,DVN,2023-03-19,7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy for Income Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-yield-dividend-stocks-223541378.html,1678919741,STORY,"['PM', 'RITM', 'DVN', 'LYB', 'GMRE', 'ZIM', 'GECC']","[In general, investors who park their capital in dividend stocks tend to be more conservative with their money. They tend to like the dependable dividends paid from their stock holdings, often used as income. Accordingly, such investors often purchase dividend stocks that come with yields in the 2-4% range traditionally considered a healthy range.Of course, there are plenty of dividend stocks that provide yields outside of this range. For investors with higher risk tolerance levels, high-yielding dividend stocks may be the preferred choice. These are companies with much more robust risk profiles, but which can often provide outsized gains (if the individual investor knows what they’re doing).Here are seven such high-yielding dividend stocks I think is worth a look. That’s despite warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates may have to go higher throughout 2023 than initially projected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZIMZIM Integrated Shipping$24.07GECCGreat Elm Capital$8.82RITMRithm Capital$8.00LYBLyondellBasell Industries$84.16DVNDevon Energy$45.12PMPhilip Morris$96.18GMREGlobal Medical REIT$9.44ZIM Integrated Shipping (ZIM)Container ships now carry about 90 of the world's cargo and the largest container ships can carry over 21,000 units. This one is operated by ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM stock)Source: Darryl Brooks / Shutterstock.comZIM Integrated Shipping (NYSE:ZIM) is one of the highest-yield dividend stocks on this list and one of the highest-yield dividend stocks, period. That makes the shipping and logistics firm inherently interesting to income investors right now. The Israeli company has provided a long stretch of dividends that provide intrigue for investors looking for ways to play the supply chain sector.ZIM Integrated Shipping’s business dates back to 1945, and the company began operating shipping container logistics in the early 1970s. However, the company’s dividend only stretches back to the late summer of 2021. In those six periods, the company has paid massive dividends that truly impress. Most recently, the company paid a $2.95 dividend in November. Over the last year, it has paid a whopping $27.55 of dividends, higher than its current $20.25 share price.Story continuesThat’s probably unsustainable given that one of those dividends was worth $17. But $2.95 on a $20.25 share price is still a very high 14.56% yield. That was what the company paid most recently, and is very much in line with previous payments.Great Elm Capital (GECC)Stock market digital graph chart on LED display concept. A large display of daily stock market price and quotation.Source: Feylite / ShutterstockGreat Elm Capital (NASDAQ:GECC) is a company that invests in the debt of middle-market firms, and derives income from those investments. In turn, investors who purchase its stock to fund those investments receive high-yield dividends for their trouble. Currently, that yield is approaching 20%. Indeed, GECC stock certainly isn’t for the faint of heart, but it can provide a substantial additional return for those seeking yield.The company is currently beefing up its investment in the healthcare space. It closed on the purchase of three healthcare asset-based loans in December. Further, the company formed Great Elm Healthcare Finance in cooperation with an affiliate of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. Healthcare is a relatively stable sector due to the truism that demand for healthcare is relatively inelastic. People need to see doctors regularly. That lends credibility to the idea that the company is steadier than it may seem at first glance.The downside is that GECC stock may already be fully-priced at these levels. Still, its dividend alone is likely to produce double-digit returns for investors willing to place a bet on this stock right now.Rithm Capital (RITM)A small house made of wooden blocks and colored sticky notes with the words Mortgage buydowns.Source: Villi-Vonki / Shutterstock.comInvestors willing to bet that the mortgage market is okay should also consider Rithm Capital (NYSE:RITM) stock. It is a real estate investment trust that focuses on the mortgage sector. That will be off-putting to investors who worry that we may already be in the midst of another bubble, similar in magnitude to the subprime mortgage crisis.Yet, at the same time, Rithm Capital’s financial statements don’t suggest trouble at all. Its revenue and net income figures improved in 2022 over 2021. The company’s recent results showed bottom-line net income of $983,285 in 2022. Thus, it is not a large company, nor does it boast massive profits. Some investors simply overlook this stock due to its size and lack of great assets.That said, I think this is a stock with obvious upside, at least according to analysts. Additionally, the company’s dividends have been continually increasing since mid-2020. Finally, Rithm Capital is a REIT, so investors will receive 90% of company profits by law.The risk is clear: further rate hikes could negatively affect the already wobbly mortgage market and Rithm Capital by extension. But those willing to take accept this risk could earn substantial returns from here.LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a much less risky stock than prior equities on this list. Its 5.24% yield is still considered ‘risky’ but it’s substantially lower than the aforementioned names on this list. That lower risk is primarily due to the company’s core business, in plastic resin and chemical production. Generally-speaking, its a much more predictable industry than those of the previously mentioned names.Furthermore, investors with a penchant for ESG stocks might also like LyondellBasell Industries. It boasts all kinds of achievements in its latest earnings report. Most notably, the company received an EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance, ranking in the 91st percentile among 7,500 firms surveyed.The company’s revenues slipped slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4. That said, overall 2022 revenues increased to $50.45 million from $46.13 million a year earlier. The firm’s stock has roughly $7 of upside beyond its current $91 price. When combined with its dividend, the returns with LYB stock quickly become very attractive.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comLet’s start with Devon Energy’s (NYSE:DVN) dividend in discussing it as an investment. Just a few weeks ago, Devon Energy reported 2022 full-year results. The news was good: fixed dividends were increased by 11%. Indeed, 2022 was a strong year for the energy sector. The results were positive for Devon Energy as well, leading to a dividend payment during the year that more than doubled to $5.17.Let’s move to the macroeconomic catalysts that could benefit the company more generally. Investors are unsure of what to expect from the energy sector in 2023. That’s where the risk is for the company. If a recession officially begins or some new variant of Covid-19 emerges the economy will falter. In short, demand would quickly weaken and prices would fall.Yet, that isn’t what Wall Street is expecting from the company. Instead, analysts see substantial upside for investors over the coming 12-18 months. The company hasn’t reduced its dividend since 2017 so that should only add to the potential upside with this stock..Philip Morris (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comI’ve focused on Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock for its dividend and positive catalysts a few times over the past months. It bears repeating – while cigarette sales have been declining for some time, Philip Morris is the best-placed large tobacco company. Its smokeless tobacco strategy and portfolio make it very noteworthy. Its 5.13% dividend only makes it that much more interesting.Philip Morris’ IQOS tobacco e-cigarette and vape products are garnering a lot of attention from analysts who like that the company is finding ways to replace cigarette revenues better than its competitors. The firm’s Swedish Match purchase, a company that produces snus, nicotine pouches, and lighters, has proven beneficial with strong overall growth.In short, Philip Morris is a so-called sin stock that many perceive to be past its best days. However, it is arguably in the middle of an impressive pivot. And that pivot has all kinds of upside that could reward investors.Global Medical REIT (GMRE)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockGlobal Medical REIT (NYSE:GMRE) is investment grade for several of the same reasons as Green Elm Capital above. For one, REITs are obligated to reward investors with 90% of profits. Of course, that only truly matters if those profits are growing.Fortunately, they are. In 2022, the company’s net income reached $13.32 million, up from $11.8 million in 2021. And revenues continue to grow in both the most recent quarter and the throughout 2022.Global Medical REIT leases medical facilities to healthcare providers. It is currently in the process of buying a property for $6.7 million. And it has two properties under contract to be sold for a total of $11.6 million.The company’s portfolio of properties was 96.5% occupied at the end of 2022 and projects a base rent of $114.5 million. Again, healthcare real estate tends to be more stable than many other subsectors, adding weight to the argument that favors the company and its high-yield dividend.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.Financial markets are currently wavering following the SVB collapse and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s roadmap to tame inflation. Some analysts believe the central bank could pause interest rate hikes to stop a possible crisis spillover in the banking sector. But others question how the Fed would be able to tame inflation if it pauses its interest rate hikes? Only time would tell could be the right answer since experts have been proven wrong time and again given the unprecedented nature of the crisis we are seeing in the markets where history is no longer a guide.However, when it comes to dividend stocks, history does provide some guidance. Data shows that when markets are going through turmoil and recession is around the corner, dividend growth stocks provide a solid refuge to investors. An S&amp;P Global report said that companies that have a strong track record of growing their dividends provide investors a chance to have exposure to “high-quality stocks and greater income over time, therefore buffering against market volatility and addressing the risk of rising rates to some extent.”One of the most important reasons why investing in dividend growth stocks seems worthwhile is the buffer against volatility that comes with having an exposure to these stocks. The S&amp;P Global report said that during Dec. 31, 1999 to March 31, 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 and S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index by an average of 140 bps per month and 49 bps per month, respectively, during down market cycles.A detailed research report by Raymond James also mentions several data points highlighting the performance of dividend stocks during recessionary periods. The report, titled “Investment Strategies for Recessionary Periods,” says that for investors who are increasingly sensitive to market fluctuations” and want to “proactively manage volatility,” high quality fixed-income and dividend-producing equity investments are suitable as they have historically shown resilience during recessionary environments.Story continuesMost Promising Dividend Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used the Finviz stock screener to find stocks with dividend yields over 2% whose average analyst price estimates are at least 30% above their current stock prices.

We like the private equity business because 1) the sector is taking market share with investor portfolios, 2) the business results of private equity firms are asymmetrical in bull markets versus bear markets, and 3) the locked-up client capital is more durable than traditional investment managers.Carlyle’s stock had a tough 2022. Private equity firms had very strong years in 2020 and 2021 as investors recognized the attractiveness of the business model. They bid up multiples to unattractive levels. Then as the bear market of 2022 unfolded, investors pulled away from the stocks of private equity firms due to the firm’s equity exposure.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts.Investing in the stock market for the long term is perhaps the surest of the ways to expand your wealth. On the books it sounds very easy: just invest your money in stocks for the long term and forget. But the pull of the short-term cycles and volatility is so strong that many give in and cash out or change their strategies before their investments could bear fruit. While panic selling or cashing out doesn’t hurt in the short term, when you contextualize these short-term, often irrational decision making based on data, the real toll of short-term thinking comes to light.For example, a study by Franklin Templeton Investments shows that if you had invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 Index on January 1, 2003, your original investment would have grown to $62,755 by the end of 2022. But that’s not the most interesting part. What makes the study interesting is that its data shows that if you missed just 10 days out of this 20-year period (total 5,035 trading days), your final return would be reduced by a whopping 64%. That means not having your money invested in the stock market for just 10 days in this 20-year period would give you $28,750 at the end of 2022, and not $62,755. That’s because individual days in the stock market have a lot of ups and downs. If you cash out or panic sell during bad days, you lose the potential profits that come on good days.The kind of volatility and turmoil investors are seeing in 2023 amid the collapse of SVB and recession warnings is unprecedented. In this backdrop the importance of long-term investing becomes more important. That’s why we decided to take a look at some of the best long-term stocks according to Wall Street analysts.Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the top 50 holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and picked 15 stocks which have the highest upside potential from their current levels based on their one-year average price targets.

We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, also fits squarely within our earnings reset group. We took advantage of its enterprise multiple falling back to historic lows to initiate a starter position in the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EV) and developer of battery technologies. Tesla has a significant structural cost advantage in battery production, EV manufacturing and EV selling, which gives it industry-leading operating margins in EVs. As the auto cycle has softened, the stock has sold off substantially with the rest of the automakers, despite EVs continuing to have a secular growth advantage. Tesla has a clean balance sheet with negative net debt and enormous revenue growth, EBITDA growth and free cash flow generation. Its margin buffer also gives the company the ability to cut prices while still protecting earnings better than competitors, which should help support continued volume growth. There is also significant upside optionality driven by its software offerings, which we do not believe is currently priced into the stock.That being said, Tesla is highly indexed to a flagging auto market and we expect its earnings outlook to worsen in the near term. We are also monitoring increasing EV competition and the recently emerging risks to the brand and management integrity raised by CEO Elon Musk’s actions at Twitter to determine future position size in the portfolio.”7.

Over the course of the last year, Apple’s consensus estimated forward free cash flows rose modestly, while its enterprise value fell by around 30%. Apple ranks below the 25th most attractive name in the portfolio and so its weight is capped at 4% vs. 6% for names in the top quartile.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Poultry Companies in the World15 Best Stocks Under $10015 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsDisclosure: None. 15 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.53bUS$8.39bUS$9.29bUS$10.4bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bUS$11.6bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.49%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.56%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$6.9kUS$7.1kUS$7.2kUS$7.4kUS$7.2kUS$6.8kUS$6.5kUS$6.1kUS$5.8kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.1%) = US$192bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$192b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$83bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$150b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$267, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.117. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for McDonald'sStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

These data were presented today in a late-breaking oral presentation (Session: S042 – Late-Breaking Research: Session 2) at the 2023 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, held from March 17-21 in New Orleans.Results from the study demonstrate that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body repigmentation in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo, as measured by total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) scores. Specifically, the study met its primary endpoint and patients receiving povorcitinib experienced statistically superior improvements in T-VASI at Week 24 compared to placebo (povorcitinib 15 mg, –19.1%; 45 mg, –17.8%; 75 mg, –15.7% vs. placebo, +2.3%; least squares mean [LSM] difference, P&lt;0.01). Additionally, more patients who received povorcitinib achieved the key secondary endpoint of T-VASI50 (≥50% reduction from baseline in the T-VASI) at Week 24 (10.5%, 15 mg arm; 15.2%, 45 mg arm; 5.6%, 75 mg arm vs. 3.0%, placebo arm) and continued to improve during an open-label extension period through Week 36 of treatment (28.6%, povorcitinib 15 → 75 mg arm; 17.2%, 45 mg arm; 15.2%, 75 mg arm; and 3.0%, placebo → 75 mg arm), following dose adjustment.""Vitiligo is a chronic, immune-mediated disease which, until recently, had limited treatment options available to patients. We are proud to have brought to market the first and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmacologic therapy for vitiligo, and continue to develop additional treatments for patients with vitiligo,"" said Kurt Brown, M.D., Global Program Head, Povorcitinib, and Associate Vice President, Drug Development, Inflammation &amp; Autoimmunity, Incyte. ""These data suggest the potential of povorcitinib as an oral treatment for patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo and its potential versatility across multiple autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including hidradenitis suppurativa for which we recently announced 52-week Phase 2 results.""Story continuesAdditional key findings from the study include:Treatment with povorcitinib also resulted in facial repigmentation in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo, as measured by facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) scores. At Week 24, patients receiving povorcitinib experienced statistically superior improvements in F-VASI compared to placebo (15 mg, –27.7%; 45 mg, –36.4%; 75 mg, –29.4% vs. placebo, –5.1%; LSM difference, P&lt;0.01).At Week 24, 18.4% (15 mg), 45.5% (45 mg) and 27.8% (75 mg) of patients treated with povorcitinib achieved ≥50% reduction from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI50) compared to 9.1% in the placebo group.Additionally at Week 24, 13.2% (15 mg), 18.2% (45 mg) and 13.9% (75 mg) of patients treated with povorcitinib achieved ≥75% reduction from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI75) compared to 3.0% in the placebo group.Continued improvement of total body and facial repigmentation with povorcitinib was seen through 36 weeks of treatment.At Week 36, T-VASI/F-VASI scores were –30.3%/–38.4% (povorcitinib 15 → 75 mg arm), –28.4%/–51.1% (45 mg arm), –28.8%/–54.3% (75 mg arm) and –5.3%/–26.1% (placebo → 75 mg arm).Povorcitinib was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the 24-week placebo-controlled period (n=126) were COVID-19 (16.7%), headache (10.3%), fatigue (9.5%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (7.9%), and acne (7.1%). No serious TEAEs were considered related to povorcitinib treatment. Additionally, no new safety signals were observed after Week 24.""Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune condition that can be difficult to manage, particularly for patients with extensive disease that manifests across a significant portion of their body,"" said Amit G. Pandya, M.D., Staff Dermatologist, Department of Dermatology, Palo Alto Foundation Medical Group and Adjunct Professor, Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ""As vitiligo can impact patients in different ways, I am encouraged by the continued focus on expanding medical treatment options, and I believe these data highlight the potential of this investigational oral treatment for patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo.""More information regarding the 2023 AAD Annual Meeting can be found at https://www.aad.org/member/meetings-education/am23.About VitiligoVitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by depigmentation of skin that results from the loss of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Overactivity of the JAK signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of vitiligo. In the United States, more than 1.5 million people are diagnosed with vitiligo1. The overall prevalence of the condition is estimated to be approximately 2-3 million2, with the majority of patients (approximately 85%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo3. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 304.About the Phase 2b Study (NCT04818346)The Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of povorcitinib (formerly INCB54707) in adult patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo.The study enrolled 171 patients (age 18 to 75 years) diagnosed with nonsegmental vitiligo affecting ≥8% of their body surface area and randomized them 1:1:1:1 to receive once-daily (QD) povorcitinib 15 mg (n=43), 45 mg (n=41), 75 mg (n=42), or placebo (n=42) for 24 weeks during the placebo-controlled period. Of the 171 randomized patients, 168 patients were treated as part of the 24-week placebo-controlled period. During the 28-week extension period (n=138), patients originally randomized to receive povorcitinib 45 mg QD continued with the same dose (n=32). Patients originally randomized to receive povorcitinib 15 mg QD, 75 mg QD or placebo each received 75 mg povorcitinib QD for the duration of the 28-week extension period (n=37, 34 and 35, respectively). Following the extension period is a 24-week follow-up period.The primary endpoint is the percentage change from baseline in total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at Week 24. The key secondary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving T-VASI50 (≥50% reduction from baseline in the T-VASI) at Week 24.Additional endpoints include the percentage of patients achieving F-VASI50 (≥50% reduction from baseline in facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index [F-VASI]), F-VASI75 (≥75% reduction from baseline in F-VASI) and T-VASI50 at each visit. Safety of povorcitinib was assessed by the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).For more information about this Phase 2b study, please visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04818346.About Povorcitinib (INCB54707)Povorcitinib (INCB54707) is an oral small-molecule JAK1 inhibitor currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for vitiligo, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and prurigo nodularis.

These data were presented today in two late-breaking oral presentations (Session: S025 – Late Breaking Research: Session 1) at the 2023 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, held from March 17-21 in New Orleans.The 104-week long-term extension (LTE) data build on the positive 52-week TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 results previously announced and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.""The results presented today at AAD are significant because they provide important long-term efficacy and safety data for nonsegmental vitiligo patients treated with Opzelura,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; Autoimmunity, Incyte. ""The data, which showed improvements in both facial and total body repigmentation with continued treatment, further our understanding of the long-term benefits of Opzelura as a safe and meaningful pharmacologic treatment option for vitiligo patients.""The LTE evaluated TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 study participants from Weeks 52 to 104 in two separate cohorts based on patients who achieved a complete or almost complete response by Week 52. In the cohort of patients who achieved complete or almost complete facial repigmentation (≥F-VASI90, Cohort A), patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive Opzelura twice daily (BID) or vehicle (i.e., Opzelura withdrawal) through Week 104 to evaluate time to relapse (defined as &lt;F-VASI75) and time to maintain ≥F-VASI90 response; time to regain F-VASI75 and F-VASI90 response after relapse (with reinitiation of Opzelura treatment) was also evaluated. In the cohort of patients who did not achieve complete or almost complete facial repigmentation (&lt;F-VASI90, Cohort B), all patients were continued on Opzelura BID to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety.Story continuesKey findings from Cohort A:Many patients who achieved a high level of facial repigmentation (≥F-VASI90) in TRuE-V1/TRuE-V2 were able to maintain durable response for one year after discontinuing Opzelura treatment.Approximately 29% of patients randomized to the withdrawal arm (i.e., applying vehicle cream) relapsed (&lt;F-VASI75) during the extension period (through Week 104).Among patients who relapsed (&lt;F-VASI75) in the withdrawal arm, 75% of patients regained ≥F-VASI75 once treatment with Opzelura was reinitiated (median 12 weeks) and 69% of patients regained ≥F-VASI90.For those continuing Opzelura treatment, approximately 62% of patients who achieved ≥F-VASI90 at Week 52 maintained response for one year with ongoing Opzelura treatment.Opzelura was well tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events through Week 104. Mild or moderate treatment-related adverse events among patients in the Opzelura arm included application site dermatitis, application site rash and hyperlipidemia.Key findings from Cohort B:In patients who did not achieve near complete facial repigmentation (&lt;F-VASI90) at Week 52 and continued treatment with Opzelura, improvements in facial and total body repigmentation, as shown by greater proportions of patients reaching F-VASI75 and T-VASI50, were observed through Week 104.For patients treated with Opzelura from Day 1 in the parent studies (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2), the percentage who achieved F-VASI75 at Week 104 more than doubled (66%) compared to Week 52 (31%), and approximately 34% attained F-VASI90 at Week 104.Additionally, T-VASI50 was achieved at Week 104 by 64% of TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 patients applying Opzelura since Day 1, increasing from 43% at Week 52.Opzelura was well tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events through Week 104. All treatment–related adverse events in the Opzelura arm were mild or moderate, the most common being application site pruritus.""I am extremely encouraged by these data, which show continued improvements in facial and total body repigmentation over two years of treatment with Opzelura,"" said David Rosmarin, M.D., Chair, Department of Dermatology at Indiana University School of Medicine. ""Vitiligo is a chronic condition and these results demonstrate the long-term potential of this medical treatment for people with vitiligo who are interested in repigmentation.""About VitiligoVitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by depigmentation of skin that results from the loss of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Overactivity of the JAK signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of vitiligo. In the United States, more than 1.5 million people are diagnosed with vitiligo1. The overall prevalence of the condition is estimated to be approximately 2-3 million2, with the majority of patients (approximately 85%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo3. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 304.About TRuE-VThe TRuE-V clinical trial program includes two Phase 3 studies, TRuE-V1 (NCT04052425) and TRuE-V2 (NCT04057573), evaluating the safety and efficacy of Opzelura in patients with vitiligo. Each study enrolled approximately 300 patients (age ≥12 years) who have been diagnosed with nonsegmental vitiligo.About Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) Cream 1.5%Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States. Opzelura is also approved in the U.S. for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.On February 24, 2023, Incyte announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of ruxolitinib cream for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. The marketing authorization application (MAA) and CHMP opinion are now under review by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant centralized marketing authorizations for medicinal products in the EU.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura. In April 2022, Incyte entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. for the development, manufacturing and exclusive commercialization of ruxolitinib cream for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory dermatology indications in Japan.Opzelura is a trademark of Incyte.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONOPZELURA is for use on the skin only. Do not use OPZELURA in your eyes, mouth, or vagina.OPZELURA may cause serious side effects, including:Serious Infections: OPZELURA contains ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib belongs to a class of medicines called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors are medicines that affect your immune system. JAK inhibitors can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking JAK inhibitors by mouth, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have been hospitalized or died from these infections. Some people have had serious infections of their lungs while taking OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with OPZELURA.OPZELURA should not be used in people with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. You should not start using OPZELURA if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster) while using OPZELURA.Increased risk of death due to any reason (all causes): Increased risk of death has happened in people 50 years of age and older who have at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth.Cancer and immune system problems: OPZELURA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers have happened in people taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth. People taking JAK inhibitors by mouth have a higher risk of certain cancers including lymphoma and lung cancer, especially if they are a current or past smoker. Some people have had skin cancers while using OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider will regularly check your skin during your treatment with OPZELURA. Limit the amount of time you spend in the sunlight. Wear protective clothing when you are in the sun and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen.Increased risk of major cardiovascular events: Increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death have happened in people 50 years of age and older who have at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth, especially in current or past smokers.Blood clots: Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) can happen in some people taking OPZELURA. This may be life-threatening. Blood clots in the vein of the legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) and lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) have happened more often in people who are 50 years of age and older and with at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth.Low blood cell counts: OPZELURA may cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), low red blood cell counts (anemia), and low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). If needed, your healthcare provider will do a blood test to check your blood cell counts during your treatment with OPZELURA and may stop your treatment if signs or symptoms of low blood cell counts happen.Cholesterol increases: Cholesterol increase has happened in people when ruxolitinib is taken by mouth. Tell your healthcare provider if you have high cholesterol or triglycerides.Before starting OPZELURA, tell your healthcare provider if you:have an infection, are being treated for one, or have had an infection that does not go away or keeps coming backhave diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune systemhave TB or have been in close contact with someone with TBhave had shingles (herpes zoster)have or have had hepatitis B or Clive, have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections. These infections may happen or become more severe if you use OPZELURA. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common.think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as: fever, sweating, or chills, muscle aches, cough or shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than usual, feeling very tiredhave ever had any type of cancer, or are a current or past smokerhave had a heart attack, other heart problems, or a strokehave had blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs in the pasthave high cholesterol or triglycerideshave or have had low white or red blood cell countsare pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

71,de095596-e822-3a16-af2c-27e352045aa5,LYB,2023-03-19,7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy for Income Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-yield-dividend-stocks-223541378.html,1678919741,STORY,"['PM', 'RITM', 'DVN', 'LYB', 'GMRE', 'ZIM', 'GECC']","[In general, investors who park their capital in dividend stocks tend to be more conservative with their money. They tend to like the dependable dividends paid from their stock holdings, often used as income. Accordingly, such investors often purchase dividend stocks that come with yields in the 2-4% range traditionally considered a healthy range.Of course, there are plenty of dividend stocks that provide yields outside of this range. For investors with higher risk tolerance levels, high-yielding dividend stocks may be the preferred choice. These are companies with much more robust risk profiles, but which can often provide outsized gains (if the individual investor knows what they’re doing).Here are seven such high-yielding dividend stocks I think is worth a look. That’s despite warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates may have to go higher throughout 2023 than initially projected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZIMZIM Integrated Shipping$24.07GECCGreat Elm Capital$8.82RITMRithm Capital$8.00LYBLyondellBasell Industries$84.16DVNDevon Energy$45.12PMPhilip Morris$96.18GMREGlobal Medical REIT$9.44ZIM Integrated Shipping (ZIM)Container ships now carry about 90 of the world's cargo and the largest container ships can carry over 21,000 units. This one is operated by ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM stock)Source: Darryl Brooks / Shutterstock.comZIM Integrated Shipping (NYSE:ZIM) is one of the highest-yield dividend stocks on this list and one of the highest-yield dividend stocks, period. That makes the shipping and logistics firm inherently interesting to income investors right now. The Israeli company has provided a long stretch of dividends that provide intrigue for investors looking for ways to play the supply chain sector.ZIM Integrated Shipping’s business dates back to 1945, and the company began operating shipping container logistics in the early 1970s. However, the company’s dividend only stretches back to the late summer of 2021. In those six periods, the company has paid massive dividends that truly impress. Most recently, the company paid a $2.95 dividend in November. Over the last year, it has paid a whopping $27.55 of dividends, higher than its current $20.25 share price.Story continuesThat’s probably unsustainable given that one of those dividends was worth $17. But $2.95 on a $20.25 share price is still a very high 14.56% yield. That was what the company paid most recently, and is very much in line with previous payments.Great Elm Capital (GECC)Stock market digital graph chart on LED display concept. A large display of daily stock market price and quotation.Source: Feylite / ShutterstockGreat Elm Capital (NASDAQ:GECC) is a company that invests in the debt of middle-market firms, and derives income from those investments. In turn, investors who purchase its stock to fund those investments receive high-yield dividends for their trouble. Currently, that yield is approaching 20%. Indeed, GECC stock certainly isn’t for the faint of heart, but it can provide a substantial additional return for those seeking yield.The company is currently beefing up its investment in the healthcare space. It closed on the purchase of three healthcare asset-based loans in December. Further, the company formed Great Elm Healthcare Finance in cooperation with an affiliate of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. Healthcare is a relatively stable sector due to the truism that demand for healthcare is relatively inelastic. People need to see doctors regularly. That lends credibility to the idea that the company is steadier than it may seem at first glance.The downside is that GECC stock may already be fully-priced at these levels. Still, its dividend alone is likely to produce double-digit returns for investors willing to place a bet on this stock right now.Rithm Capital (RITM)A small house made of wooden blocks and colored sticky notes with the words Mortgage buydowns.Source: Villi-Vonki / Shutterstock.comInvestors willing to bet that the mortgage market is okay should also consider Rithm Capital (NYSE:RITM) stock. It is a real estate investment trust that focuses on the mortgage sector. That will be off-putting to investors who worry that we may already be in the midst of another bubble, similar in magnitude to the subprime mortgage crisis.Yet, at the same time, Rithm Capital’s financial statements don’t suggest trouble at all. Its revenue and net income figures improved in 2022 over 2021. The company’s recent results showed bottom-line net income of $983,285 in 2022. Thus, it is not a large company, nor does it boast massive profits. Some investors simply overlook this stock due to its size and lack of great assets.That said, I think this is a stock with obvious upside, at least according to analysts. Additionally, the company’s dividends have been continually increasing since mid-2020. Finally, Rithm Capital is a REIT, so investors will receive 90% of company profits by law.The risk is clear: further rate hikes could negatively affect the already wobbly mortgage market and Rithm Capital by extension. But those willing to take accept this risk could earn substantial returns from here.LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a much less risky stock than prior equities on this list. Its 5.24% yield is still considered ‘risky’ but it’s substantially lower than the aforementioned names on this list. That lower risk is primarily due to the company’s core business, in plastic resin and chemical production. Generally-speaking, its a much more predictable industry than those of the previously mentioned names.Furthermore, investors with a penchant for ESG stocks might also like LyondellBasell Industries. It boasts all kinds of achievements in its latest earnings report. Most notably, the company received an EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance, ranking in the 91st percentile among 7,500 firms surveyed.The company’s revenues slipped slightly on a year-over-year basis in Q4. That said, overall 2022 revenues increased to $50.45 million from $46.13 million a year earlier. The firm’s stock has roughly $7 of upside beyond its current $91 price. When combined with its dividend, the returns with LYB stock quickly become very attractive.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comLet’s start with Devon Energy’s (NYSE:DVN) dividend in discussing it as an investment. Just a few weeks ago, Devon Energy reported 2022 full-year results. The news was good: fixed dividends were increased by 11%. Indeed, 2022 was a strong year for the energy sector. The results were positive for Devon Energy as well, leading to a dividend payment during the year that more than doubled to $5.17.Let’s move to the macroeconomic catalysts that could benefit the company more generally. Investors are unsure of what to expect from the energy sector in 2023. That’s where the risk is for the company. If a recession officially begins or some new variant of Covid-19 emerges the economy will falter. In short, demand would quickly weaken and prices would fall.Yet, that isn’t what Wall Street is expecting from the company. Instead, analysts see substantial upside for investors over the coming 12-18 months. The company hasn’t reduced its dividend since 2017 so that should only add to the potential upside with this stock..Philip Morris (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comI’ve focused on Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock for its dividend and positive catalysts a few times over the past months. It bears repeating – while cigarette sales have been declining for some time, Philip Morris is the best-placed large tobacco company. Its smokeless tobacco strategy and portfolio make it very noteworthy. Its 5.13% dividend only makes it that much more interesting.Philip Morris’ IQOS tobacco e-cigarette and vape products are garnering a lot of attention from analysts who like that the company is finding ways to replace cigarette revenues better than its competitors. The firm’s Swedish Match purchase, a company that produces snus, nicotine pouches, and lighters, has proven beneficial with strong overall growth.In short, Philip Morris is a so-called sin stock that many perceive to be past its best days. However, it is arguably in the middle of an impressive pivot. And that pivot has all kinds of upside that could reward investors.Global Medical REIT (GMRE)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockGlobal Medical REIT (NYSE:GMRE) is investment grade for several of the same reasons as Green Elm Capital above. For one, REITs are obligated to reward investors with 90% of profits. Of course, that only truly matters if those profits are growing.Fortunately, they are. In 2022, the company’s net income reached $13.32 million, up from $11.8 million in 2021. And revenues continue to grow in both the most recent quarter and the throughout 2022.Global Medical REIT leases medical facilities to healthcare providers. It is currently in the process of buying a property for $6.7 million. And it has two properties under contract to be sold for a total of $11.6 million.The company’s portfolio of properties was 96.5% occupied at the end of 2022 and projects a base rent of $114.5 million. Again, healthcare real estate tends to be more stable than many other subsectors, adding weight to the argument that favors the company and its high-yield dividend.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company has raised its dividend payout 24 years in a row. Shares today have a forward yield of 2.34%. While this may not sound high, over the past five years, this rate of payout has grown by an average of 13.8% annually.Investors who have long held ADP, and have reinvested these payouts into additional shares, have generated strong returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results, but per dqydj.com’s stock return calculator, ADP has generated total annualized returns of 10.8% over the past 25 years.Story continuesCincinnati Financial (CINF)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockCincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) may not be one of the best-known property and casualty insurers, but among insurers, it may be for some investors one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. Admittedly, CINF stock has only slightly beaten the market over a long time frame. Over the past 25 years, CINF has produced annualized total returns of around 7.5%, whereas the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested), has produced annualized returns of 7.2% during this time frame.However, while perhaps not a standout choice for capital growth, CINF is a great choice for dividend-focused investors. As SureDividend.com has pointed out, CINF is one of just 13 stocks that has raised its dividend more than 60 years in a row. With a current forward yield of 2.7%. The company has raised this payout by an average of 6.65% over the past five years.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Source: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another of the blue-chips sporting a dividend growth track record of at least sixty years. The recession and inflation-resistant nature of JNJ’s diversified health care business has enabled it to achieve this in prior decades. The company is poised to continue with this tradition during today’s challenging times, as well as in the decades to come. JNJ stock right now has a forward yield of 2.94%, and the company has grown its payout by an average of 6.11% annually over the past five years.Sure, JNJ’s near-term share price performance has been subpar. Yet while JNJ’s recent double-digit drop may at first seem concerning, this is likely to be just temporary. Trading at the low end of its historic valuation at 15 times earnings, forecasts calling for consistent earnings growth over the next two years point to shares getting back on track.Lockheed Martin (LMT)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWith only 20 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has yet to gain “dividend aristocrat” status. However, don’t assume that means that LMT isn’t one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. Given that the defense contractor’s dividend payout ratio is only 41.6%, there’s a good chance it continues to raise its payout over the next five years, which will then place LMT stock in the dividend aristocrats category. Shares today have a forward yield of 2.51%, and the payout has grown by an average of 8.71% annually for the past five years.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin’s business may now be even better-positioned to thrive in the coming years, and not just because of current conflicts such as Russia’s Ukraine invasion. With tensions between the U.S. and China rising, the Biden administration is looking to boost military hardware spending.Medtronic (MDT)Source: ShutterstockIf you’re looking for a blue-chip offering a moderately-higher yield, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) may be a great choice. Shares in the medical device maker, domiciled in Ireland but operating globally, currently have a forward dividend yield of 3.49%.MDT stock also has a 9-year track record of dividend growth. It may be more than a decade away from achieving “dividend aristocrat” status, but with payout growth averaging 8.1% annually over the past five years, more dividend increases may be in store. Yes, there have been some concerns about future earnings growth recently.However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator has recently argued, as near-term headwinds resolve, and management pivots to higher-growth segments of the industry, Medtronic could experience a growth resurgence. Besides enabling MDT to continue raising its payout, this may also result in multiple expansion for the stock, which today trades for only 14.8 times forward earnings.Pepsico (PEP)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockPepsico’s (NASDAQ:PEP) status as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy and hold is self-evident. With 50 years of dividend growth, PEP is a bona fide “dividend king.” Operating in the consumer staples sector, the company is able to generate steady earnings that keep up with inflation.PEP stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past 25 years, generating annualized total returns of 8.28% during this timeframe. More impressively, PEP’s 25-year performance has handily beat that of its main peer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Since 1998, KO stock has generated total annualized returns of just 4.47%. As I’ve argued before, PEP has KO beat when it comes to the sweetest cola stock to buy and hold. Although both trade at similar valuations, and KO offers a higher dividend yield (3.07% versus 2.65%), PEP has greater earnings and dividend growth potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockOver the past 25 years, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has delivered stunning returns to investors. Over this time frame, annualized returns for the health insurance and healthcare services giant have come in at 18.45%.Future returns may be more modest, but UNH stock still has a path to generate double-digit annualized returns from here. First, via earnings growth. Forecasts call for UNH’s earnings to rise by 17.7% this year and 13.5% next year. Assuming shares rise in tandem with earnings growth, this alone could generate double-digit gains.In addition, potential future returns for UnitedHealth Group keep rising, as the company becomes more of a dividend-payer. UNH’s forward yield may only be 1.42%, but this payout has grown by an average of 17.1% annually for the past five years. A low payout ratio (28.84%) points to more room for such high dividend growth.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts.Investing in the stock market for the long term is perhaps the surest of the ways to expand your wealth. On the books it sounds very easy: just invest your money in stocks for the long term and forget. But the pull of the short-term cycles and volatility is so strong that many give in and cash out or change their strategies before their investments could bear fruit. While panic selling or cashing out doesn’t hurt in the short term, when you contextualize these short-term, often irrational decision making based on data, the real toll of short-term thinking comes to light.For example, a study by Franklin Templeton Investments shows that if you had invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 Index on January 1, 2003, your original investment would have grown to $62,755 by the end of 2022. But that’s not the most interesting part. What makes the study interesting is that its data shows that if you missed just 10 days out of this 20-year period (total 5,035 trading days), your final return would be reduced by a whopping 64%. That means not having your money invested in the stock market for just 10 days in this 20-year period would give you $28,750 at the end of 2022, and not $62,755. That’s because individual days in the stock market have a lot of ups and downs. If you cash out or panic sell during bad days, you lose the potential profits that come on good days.The kind of volatility and turmoil investors are seeing in 2023 amid the collapse of SVB and recession warnings is unprecedented. In this backdrop the importance of long-term investing becomes more important. That’s why we decided to take a look at some of the best long-term stocks according to Wall Street analysts.Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the top 50 holdings of Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and picked 15 stocks which have the highest upside potential from their current levels based on their one-year average price targets.

(NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91One-Year Average Price Estimate: $196.35While Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is under pressure after the SVB collapse, the stock remains a long-term pick of several analysts as the company is a dominant player in the EV market which is expected to see huge growth in the years to come.One of the biggest Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls, Cathie Wood, earlier this year said Tesla stock could hit $500 per share by 2026 based on its EV business aloneClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, also fits squarely within our earnings reset group. We took advantage of its enterprise multiple falling back to historic lows to initiate a starter position in the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EV) and developer of battery technologies. Tesla has a significant structural cost advantage in battery production, EV manufacturing and EV selling, which gives it industry-leading operating margins in EVs. As the auto cycle has softened, the stock has sold off substantially with the rest of the automakers, despite EVs continuing to have a secular growth advantage. Tesla has a clean balance sheet with negative net debt and enormous revenue growth, EBITDA growth and free cash flow generation. Its margin buffer also gives the company the ability to cut prices while still protecting earnings better than competitors, which should help support continued volume growth. There is also significant upside optionality driven by its software offerings, which we do not believe is currently priced into the stock.That being said, Tesla is highly indexed to a flagging auto market and we expect its earnings outlook to worsen in the near term. We are also monitoring increasing EV competition and the recently emerging risks to the brand and management integrity raised by CEO Elon Musk’s actions at Twitter to determine future position size in the portfolio.”7. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110One-Year Average Price Estimate: $597.74UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best long-term stocks to buy as the company pays solid dividends and has stable fundamentals.

The biggest stakeholder of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2 billion stake in the company.Here is what Distillate Capital has to say about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The largest sector change in the rebalance was a six-percentage point increase in technology. The biggest component of this increase was the introduction of a 4% weight in Apple, which is discussed further below. Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The biggest reductions in weight were UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which is capped at a 2% weight as it ranks in the bottom quartile of the fund by valuation.”6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135One-Year Average Price Estimate: $169.38That Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a strong long-term stock pick is hardly contended by anyone, including hedge funds, retail investors and Wall Street analysts. This is because of Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“The largest new purchase was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which after underperforming saw its valuation improve significantly. Over the course of the last year, Apple’s consensus estimated forward free cash flows rose modestly, while its enterprise value fell by around 30%. Apple ranks below the 25th most attractive name in the portfolio and so its weight is capped at 4% vs. 6% for names in the top quartile.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Poultry Companies in the World15 Best Stocks Under $10015 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend PayoutsDisclosure: None. 15 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to UnitedHealth Group's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$21b ÷ US$86b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that UnitedHealth Group has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, UnitedHealth Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for UNH? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?UnitedHealth Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 30%, which implies that it retains the remaining 70% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, UnitedHealth Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 26%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 28%.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with UnitedHealth Group's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

75,b6059e84-7fe7-3ec8-a12f-93dec83072ad,UNH,2023-03-19,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-buy-161845296.html,1678897125,STORY,['UNH'],"[High uncertainty may continue to loom over the stock market, but that doesn’t mean you need to stay on the sidelines. Instead, keep your eyes on the long-term, with solid additions to your portfolio, such as the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold.These high-quality names have historically provided investors with solid total returns. First, through steady dividend payouts that grow over time. Most of these top blue-chips are “dividend aristocrats,” with over 25 years of consecutive dividend growth. Some of them are even “dividend kings,” with dividend growth track records spanning 50 years or more.Second, along with these dividends, these types of stocks gradually appreciate in value over time. You may not get rich quickly with them, but over an extended timeframe, you have the opportunity to build wealth. So, what are the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the coming decades? Consider these seven, all of which are safe harbors in the near-term, solid winners for your portfolio in the long-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADPAutomatic Data Processing$212.33CINFCincinnati Financial$105.90JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$153.29LMTLockheed Martin$466.52MDTMedtronic$77.62PEPPepsiCo$175.02UNHUnitedHealth$461.25Automatic Data Processing (ADP)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is best known as being the world’s largest payroll processor. Given that, in good times and bad times, employers need to meet payroll, ADP is a steady, recession-resistant business.Thanks to this consistency, it’s no wonder ADP stock is on the verge of becoming a dividend aristocrat. The company has raised its dividend payout 24 years in a row. Shares today have a forward yield of 2.34%. While this may not sound high, over the past five years, this rate of payout has grown by an average of 13.8% annually.Investors who have long held ADP, and have reinvested these payouts into additional shares, have generated strong returns. Past performance is not indicative of future results, but per dqydj.com’s stock return calculator, ADP has generated total annualized returns of 10.8% over the past 25 years.Story continuesCincinnati Financial (CINF)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockCincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) may not be one of the best-known property and casualty insurers, but among insurers, it may be for some investors one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. Admittedly, CINF stock has only slightly beaten the market over a long time frame. Over the past 25 years, CINF has produced annualized total returns of around 7.5%, whereas the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested), has produced annualized returns of 7.2% during this time frame.However, while perhaps not a standout choice for capital growth, CINF is a great choice for dividend-focused investors. As SureDividend.com has pointed out, CINF is one of just 13 stocks that has raised its dividend more than 60 years in a row. With a current forward yield of 2.7%. The company has raised this payout by an average of 6.65% over the past five years.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Source: ShutterstockJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another of the blue-chips sporting a dividend growth track record of at least sixty years. The recession and inflation-resistant nature of JNJ’s diversified health care business has enabled it to achieve this in prior decades. The company is poised to continue with this tradition during today’s challenging times, as well as in the decades to come.

However, don’t assume that means that LMT isn’t one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. Given that the defense contractor’s dividend payout ratio is only 41.6%, there’s a good chance it continues to raise its payout over the next five years, which will then place LMT stock in the dividend aristocrats category. Shares today have a forward yield of 2.51%, and the payout has grown by an average of 8.71% annually for the past five years.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin’s business may now be even better-positioned to thrive in the coming years, and not just because of current conflicts such as Russia’s Ukraine invasion. With tensions between the U.S. and China rising, the Biden administration is looking to boost military hardware spending.Medtronic (MDT)Source: ShutterstockIf you’re looking for a blue-chip offering a moderately-higher yield, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) may be a great choice. Shares in the medical device maker, domiciled in Ireland but operating globally, currently have a forward dividend yield of 3.49%.MDT stock also has a 9-year track record of dividend growth. It may be more than a decade away from achieving “dividend aristocrat” status, but with payout growth averaging 8.1% annually over the past five years, more dividend increases may be in store. Yes, there have been some concerns about future earnings growth recently.However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator has recently argued, as near-term headwinds resolve, and management pivots to higher-growth segments of the industry, Medtronic could experience a growth resurgence. Besides enabling MDT to continue raising its payout, this may also result in multiple expansion for the stock, which today trades for only 14.8 times forward earnings.Pepsico (PEP)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockPepsico’s (NASDAQ:PEP) status as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy and hold is self-evident. With 50 years of dividend growth, PEP is a bona fide “dividend king.” Operating in the consumer staples sector, the company is able to generate steady earnings that keep up with inflation.PEP stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past 25 years, generating annualized total returns of 8.28% during this timeframe. More impressively, PEP’s 25-year performance has handily beat that of its main peer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Since 1998, KO stock has generated total annualized returns of just 4.47%. As I’ve argued before, PEP has KO beat when it comes to the sweetest cola stock to buy and hold. Although both trade at similar valuations, and KO offers a higher dividend yield (3.07% versus 2.65%), PEP has greater earnings and dividend growth potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo How Fast Is PepsiCo Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years PepsiCo grew its EPS by 7.4% per year. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. PepsiCo maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 8.6% to US$86b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for PepsiCo.Are PepsiCo Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since PepsiCo has a market capitalisation of US$241b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$411m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of PepsiCo but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesIs PepsiCo Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, PepsiCo is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for PepsiCo   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented positive results from the clinical trial assessing Dupixent® (dupilumab) in adults and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis. The trial, the first evaluating a biologic for this difficult-to-treat population, met its primary and key secondary endpoints. The results were featured in a late-breaking session, one of more than 20 Dupixent scientific presentations, at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2023 Annual Meeting.“Atopic hand and foot dermatitis can extensively disrupt the lives of patients, given the intense itch and painful skin lesions it causes on essential body areas,” said Eric L. Simpson, M.D., Frances J. Storrs Professor of Medical Dermatology at the Oregon Health and Science University and principal investigator of this trial. “In this trial, Dupixent significantly improved disease signs, symptoms and quality of life measures for this particularly difficult-to-treat subset of atopic dermatitis patients, with itch improvement seen as early as one week after the first dose. While the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent is well-established for atopic dermatitis more broadly, these positive results are the first demonstrating the impact on specific and heavily used areas of the body.”In the trial, patients received Dupixent (n=67) every two weeks (adults 300 mg, adolescents 200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) or placebo (n=66). At 16 weeks, patients treated with Dupixent experienced the following:40% achieved clear or almost clear skin on hands and feet compared to 17% with placebo (p≤0.01), the primary endpoint.52% saw a clinically meaningful reduction in itch on hands and feet compared to 14% with placebo (p&lt;0.0001), the key secondary endpoint.69% average reduction in signs of hand and foot lesions from baseline compared to 31% with placebo (p&lt;0.0001).75% average improvement in hand eczema disease severity from baseline compared to 40% with placebo (p&lt;0.0001).There were significant improvements in measures of hand and foot skin pain, sleep, and hand eczema-related quality of life.Story continuesThe trial demonstrated similar safety results to the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 66% for Dupixent and 74% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo included nasopharyngitis (16% Dupixent, 11% placebo), upper respiratory tract infection (9% Dupixent, 5% placebo), conjunctivitis (6% Dupixent, 2% placebo), herpes viral infections (6% Dupixent, 3% placebo) and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (6% Dupixent, 0% placebo). Additionally, 3% of patients taking Dupixent used at least one rescue medication compared to 21% of patients on placebo.There are 23 Dupixent scientific abstracts being presented across three dermatological diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation at the AAD 2023 Annual Meeting. These include oral presentations on long-term Dupixent use in children as young as 6 months with atopic dermatitis; the impact of Dupixent treatment on health-related quality of life, skin pain and sleep in prurigo nodularis; and the investigational use of Dupixent on signs, symptoms and health-related quality of life in chronic spontaneous urticaria.The potential use of Dupixent in chronic spontaneous urticaria is currently under clinical development, and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 133 adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to topical corticosteroids. Patients with hand and foot disease predominantly driven by allergic or irritant contact dermatitis were excluded from the trial.The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of hand and feet eczema at 16 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator Global Assessment Scale). The key secondary endpoint measured the proportion of patients with improvement in itch on hands and feet from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Peak-Pruritis Numeric Rating Scale [PP-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 16 weeks. Lesion sign reduction was assessed by change from baseline in Modified Total Lesion Sign Score (mTLSS; measured by a 0-36 scale), and disease severity was assessed by the change from baseline in Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score (measured by a 0-360 scale). Symptoms were assessed every one or two weeks during the trial.Additional secondary endpoints included:Skin pain reduction as assessed by the change from baseline in weekly average of daily hand and foot peak pain NRS (measured by a 0-10 scale).Sleep improvement as assessed by change from baseline in weekly average of daily Sleep NRS (measured by a 0-10 scale).Health-related quality of life, assessed by change from baseline in the Quality of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire (QoLHEQ) (measured by a 0-117 scale).About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis, in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the U.S., European Union and Japan. More than 600,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron’s VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

83,f37c14f8-6f65-3808-a5f2-ae8c682d6f58,UNP,2023-03-19,10 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-stocks-buy-now-171936279.html,1679159976,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'TMO', 'UNP', 'SPGI', 'MCO']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best stocks to buy now according to billionaire Chris Hohn. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn.Christopher Hohn is a British billionaire and hedge fund manager known for his charitable work and huge donations, as well as his brutal activist campaigns. Hohn founded The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) in 2003. Hohn had pledged to donate 50 basis points of the management fee to The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a charitable fund founded by Hohn and his ex-wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn. The foundation’s primary goal is to transform the lives of children and adolescents. It’s also working for several other causes, including climate, sexual &amp; reproductive health and to improve the lives of girls all over the world.In addition to his charity, what sets Hohn apart from other hedge fund managers is his laser-focused and often stubborn approach in activist investing. TCI Fund Management posted profits for 13-straight years through 2021. The fund lost money in 2022 as it fell by 18%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report, which cited a person with knowledge of the matter, said the fund lost money due to its huge bets on Alphabet and Microsoft. Shares of major tech companies fell in 2022 as investors fled growth stocks and found refuge in value and dividend plays.Chris Hohn's Latest Activist CampaignsUnlike several other major hedge funds, Hohn’s fund is highly concentrated in a few stocks. This makes the hedge fund vulnerable when the overall market declines. Despite this, Hohn has been relentless in pushing companies to make fundamental changes and improve their performance. One of his recent targets is Alphabet. Back in November, Hohn penned a letter to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, asking the executive to take “aggressive action” to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.Story continuesWhat makes this letter interesting is that it was written before Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) came under immense pressure amid the AI threats following the launch of ChatGPT and before analysts and investors started openly criticizing the company for over-hiring. Ultimately, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) had to accept the reality as the company announced to lay off thousands of jobs earlier this year.However, Chris Hohn is still not happy.In another letter to Sundar Pichai on January 20, Hohn said that while he likes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management is finally doing something to right size the company’s overgrown size and costs, the 12,000 job cuts “do not even reverse the very strong headcount growth of 2022.”Hohn said that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s management will “ultimately need to go further.”Hohn also said that the median salary at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is too high and he believes the company is now in a position to decrease its salaries since the competition for talent in the industry has fallen significantly.Earlier in February, billionaire Hohn wrote a letter to Airbus (AIR.PA), in which TCI has a $4.3 billion stake. The billionaire said he was writing to “urge you to immediately terminate"" negotiations with Atos over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian. Hohn said that investing in Evidian would be “value destructive” and he believes Evidian “is a low-quality, highly levered company, with 60,000 employees, operating in an extremely competitive market.”That’s not the first time Hohn used the word “value destructive” in his letter. In 2021, the hedge fund manager had asked Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) to drop its bid for Kansas City Southern. Hohn said that the deal faced significant regulatory hurdles and a decision to create a voting trust “would be hugely value destructive”.The company went ahead with the deal that ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles, just as Hohn had warned in his letter. Giving in to the huge pressure from Hohn, Canadian National announced in October 2021 that its CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest will leave the company as soon as January.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris HohnChris Hohn Hohn's Climate ActivismChris Hohn’s activism also addresses the climate change problem. And unlike other fund managers who are happy with just publishing yearly climate reports and talking ESG scores, Hohn has a no non-sense approach when it comes to ESG as he believes most of the activism in the climate space is not producing any results.Hohn, who donates to Extinction Rebellion, said at the Bloomberg Intelligence ESG Investment Forum in London in May 2022 that ESG engagement is not producing any meaningful results.“We should stop pretending and just be honest. The acid test is actual emissions, are they falling or are they rising? And they’re rising. And that’s where the rubber hits the road.” We picked the top 10 stocks from Chris Hohn’s fourth quarter of 2022 portfolio for this article.Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Chris Hohn sold over 5 million shares of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) during the fourth quarter of 2022, ending the period with just 5,191 shares of the company, which were worth about $1.1 million. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022,  83 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), down from 74 funds in the previous quarter.Here is what Diamond Hill Capital Management specifically said about Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a large railroad company that carries freight across the western US and between Canada and Mexico. It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.”9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Chris Hohn.

(NYSE:TMO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a leader in attractive end markets with a skilled management team who has demonstrated the ability to consistently and wisely allocate capital. It is the world leader in serving science. It is a globally scaled supplier serving more than 400,000 customers working within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, research institutions, and government agencies. Thermo provides many of the products and services that companies in these industries, particularly pharma and biotech, need to operate and drive science forward. The company manufactures and sells instruments, reagents, and consumables used for a wide range of applications in labs.Sales are also well balanced geographically, including leading scale in emerging markets, according to our research.The business meets all our financial guardrails. We view Thermo Fisher as an extremely durable business, and we expect mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth over the long term. With expanding margins and wise capital deployment, we expect mid-teens underlying earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.We also think Thermo Fisher’s business would be very durable in an economic downturn as pharma and biotech customers account for roughly 60% of the company’s sales today and roughly 80% of sales are highly recurring consumables and services. Thermo received a COVID boost as they supply COVID PCR tests as well as some products used in the production of COVID vaccines. As such, it is in the process of growing over that excess demand. We expect the company to move past this growth headwind by the back half of 2023. At approximately 24x our estimate for nexttwelve-months earnings per share, we believe Thermo’s valuation is attractive for this type of consistent, well-managed, and durable business.”8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our biggest detractors in Q4 included communication services sector holdings Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD). For Alphabet, Google’s parent company, growth has decelerated as advertisers have pulled back on digital ad spend following a COVID-driven acceleration as well as due to economic uncertainties. Longer term, Alphabet remains well positioned to win in multiple ways, whether in search, online video or in the cloud. We continue to see large profit pools for Alphabet in the early stages of monetization, along with the migration of advertising dollars away from traditional mediums, like TV, to online search and video. These factors give us confidence Alphabet continues to have a long runway to grow revenue and profits. Additionally, management has returned capital to shareholders— another lever that can be used to increase the per share value of the business. We view Alphabet as one of the best businesses in the world, capable of expanding revenues at an above-average rate for years to come, with a bulletproof balance sheet and an average asking price. It’s a name we’ve held since 2015, and we believe Alphabet will continue to be a strong compounder of value in the future.”7.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now11 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In for Beginners10 Mad Money Stock Picks This WeekDisclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
