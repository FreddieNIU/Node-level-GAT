Given the beating the broader semiconductor sector has taken, a great opportunity has opened up in two defensive chip names that should not only survive any downturn, but actually grow their dividends through it, leading to years of rising passive income for their investors. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) has some of the more compelling characteristics for the defensive dividend investor.Continue reading]"

And dividend investors don’t often think about tech stocks. However, there are undervalued tech stocks with dividends that are worth focusing on.In fact, there are a handful of tech stocks with low valuations and attractive dividends. Of course, not all tech stocks with nice dividends are worth buying, but a handful of them certainly are.As investors continue to fish for a low in the stock market, many of these stocks are worth buying on pullbacks by the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegardless of what the Fed is doing or how stocks are trading, businesses in the U.S. remain relatively healthy. Although the demand for their  products and services is easing somewhat, they are generally holding up well.Let’s look at several tech stocks with dividends right now.TickerCompanyCurrent PriceAVGOBroadcom$448IBMInternational Business Machines$135INTCIntel$27.80HPEHewlett Packard Enterprise$13.80CSCOCisco Systems$43.65Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comChip stocks have had a hard time recently, as this group has been pulverized in 2022. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a name worth considering.At its current prices, Broadcom offers a unique combination of stability, value and yield.Analysts, on average, expect AVGO to deliver 21% revenue growth this year and 6% growth next year. That’s alongside average forecasts calling for 34% and 8% earnings growth this year and next year, respectively.Broadcom is trading at an attractive 12 times this year’s earning. While it’s possible that analysts’ mean forecasts won’t prove accurate, the fact that analysts are upbeat on AVGO is positive.Add in the stock’s 3.5% dividend yield, and  AVGO is poised to succeed. If AVGO stock revisits the low $400s, it will be hard to ignore.Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: International Business Machines (IBM)The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.Source: Twin Design / Shutterstock.comStory continuesSo many investors are obsessed with tech stocks, but most of them overlook the dinosaurs of the sector. One such dinosaur is International Business Machines (NASDAQ:IBM).No one seems to give this stock any love, yet they are ignoring the obvious: IBM has been a relative strength leader!Given that fact, it may be an under-the-radar find for some investors.Analysts, on average, expect 5% revenue growth from IBM this year alongside 15% earnings growth. That’s very high for IBM, as those who have followed this stock for the last decade know. As for next year, analysts expect about 6% earnings growth on sub-1% revenue growth.At current prices, investors are paying about 15 times earnings and collecting a 4.8% dividend yield. When I last looked at IBM stock about a month ago, it had a lower valuation and a higher yield, but the stock has rallied more than 13% since thenFor the year, the shares are now up about  1% versus the Nasdaq’s 33% decline. Over the last 12 months, IBM is up 11.5% while the Nasdaq is down 35%.How’s that for outperformance?Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Intel (INTC)intel stockSource: canon_shooter / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has  been around forever and will likely remain around forever. However, its longevity can’t mask reality, which is rather bleak for the chipmaker at the moment.Intel is not growing, as shown by its 15.5% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3. The sharp drop of global PC sales, identified by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). may continue.Analysts’ estimates of Intel’s revenue growth could be better, but it has a 5.2% dividend yield and a healthy payout ratio. It recently raised more cash via the Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) IPO, while INTC still holds some MBLY stock, and INTC will benefit if MBLY rises further.All that said, I would love to see Intel fall below $25 before buying it. After the shares’ recent rally, their valuation is no longer as attractive as it once was. Plus, as we’re hearing from other semiconductor and chip companies, the sector is not doing well.But Intel will survive the test of time.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockPCs may be a problem, but not for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). This company, is focused on “a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.”That puts it in a different position than HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and leaves it in a well-suited to focus on other areas of tech. Unfortunately however,, growing has not been easy for HPE.Analysts expect mild revenue and profit growth this year and next year, but on the plus side, their average estimates do call for top-and bottom-line gains. Further, the shares trade at a meager seven times earnings.Consequently, HPE stock, which pays a 3.5% dividend yield, may be worth watching.Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comFinally, we have Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). While it was a darling of investors during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago, that has not been the case in recent years. Cisco has performed okay, but it has been anything but a runaway train.However, Cisco may be worth an extra look amid the current downtrend.Worth noting is that the stock trades at just 12.5 times this year’s earnings estimates and pays a 3.4% dividend yield. Cisco is not the most exciting name on this list, but its dependability and low valuation are worth focusing on.On average, analysts expect 5% earnings and revenue growth from CSCO this year. However, in 2023, analysts’ mean outlook call for 7% earnings growth on and just 4% revenue growth. If CSCO can deliver that type of mid-level growth alongside a solid yield, then we may see the stock push higher over time.A decline of the shares below $40 would have my attention even more.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

2,1774e484-18bf-3275-9bbc-d346e801baca,TXN,2022-10-10,7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy To Tap Into a Hidden Bull Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-nasdaq-stocks-buy-tap-191636879.html,1665083796,STORY,"['NFLX', 'MSFT', 'TXN', 'ADBE', 'PAYX', 'ADSK', 'DDOG', 'ZM']","[It’s been the worst year for Nasdaq stocks since the great financial crisis of 2008. While 2021 saw big sell-offs in weaker and more speculative companies, 2022 has seen nearly universal selling across the Nasdaq as investors abandon growth stocks.Many investors are understandably throwing in the towel on Nasdaq stocks. After such a bad run, people are rightly questioning many of the grand narratives that drove the previous bull market in the technology sector. On top of that, tailwinds associated with heightened digital adoption during the pandemic have long since reversed. Now layoffs and cutbacks are the order of the day across Silicon Valley.However, it’s not all bad news. In fact, for patient investors, the current chaos represents an opportunity. After seeing Nasdaq stocks soar to stratospheric levels last year, valuations have come back down to earth. Not all the growth stocks that have crashed will recover. Many firms had questionable business models or poor unit economics. There was a lot of speculative froth. However, the strongest growth stocks can consolidate during this down cycle and come out stronger. Astute investors can capitalize with these seven leading Nasdaq companies going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADSKAutodesk$205.60MSFTMicrosoft$246.81PAYXPaychex$111.93ZMZoom Video$77.89DDOGDatadog$93.81NFLXNetflix$240.87TXNTexas Intstruments$166.91Autodesk (ADSK)An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBig software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have become the latest victim of the ongoing selloff in technology stocks. Shares of leading graphics design company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) plummeted last month following its surprising and expensive acquisition of design firm Figma. Adobe’s plunge has set off a fresh round of selling in other leading SaaS giants including graphics peer Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK).However, Adobe’s problems don’t apply to ADSK stock. Autodesk’s usage base is much more tilted toward industrial, manufacturing, and infrastructure purposes. While Adobe is a creative platform widely used in media, video creation and the like, this is one of the top Nasdaq stocks to buy in terms of stability. Autodesk is much more clearly linked to less-volatile fields like vehicle design, factory management, and construction.Story continuesAs a result, Autodesk probably won’t need to make the same sort of splashy acquisitions that Adobe apparently views as essential. Meanwhile, Autodesk has already firmly crossed into strongly profitable territory. Shares sell for just 30 times forward earnings with analysts estimating 31% earnings per share growth in 2023. That’s a fine entry point.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comFor awhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appeared to be immune to the broader market sell-off. However, even MSFT stock has now gotten dragged into the mess.MSFT stock has now fallen 20% over the past six months and slipped to new 52-week lows at the end of September. Microsoft’s cash cow continues to be its dominant position with Windows and Office. However, the company’s Azure cloud computing business has revolutionized Microsoft’s outlook. Azure is already producing more than $40 billion per year in revenues and is still growing at more than 40% per year. It’s simply breathtaking success for a company of Microsoft’s size and age.Right now, Microsoft is selling off on fears that Azure will slow down as its clients pull back on spending. That’s a valid concern. But Microsoft is a cash flow machine. It’s also selling for less than 25-times forward earnings now, and earnings are still growing at a double-digit rate. Long story short, Microsoft is still a reliable blue chip growth stock option, and it’s now at its best entry point so far in 2022.Paychex (PAYX)Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhoneSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a software company focused on human resources services. The company helps firms with things such as payroll, as the name would suggest, along with benefits, insurance, and compliance.PAYX stock has slumped in part with the broader market and perhaps on concerns of a slowdown in the economy. However, investors should be aware that employment remains exceptionally strong; the U.S. unemployment rate is still at just 3.5%. This is well below the historical median. Demand for labor is also strong, and a quarter or two of weak economic output won’t change the country’s unusually strong outlook for employment too much.Paychex shares have dropped from $140 to around $110 over the past month or so. In doing so, the stock has fallen to near its 52-week-low. At this price, Paychex offers a 2.8% dividend yield on top of its consistent earnings growth record.Zoom Video (ZM)Zoom (ZM) logo on a buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comZoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) was one of the market’s hottest stocks in 2020. The video communications leader surged from around $70 a share to more than $500 during the pandemic. The company’s potential seemed limitless as companies, schools, and universities signed up for paid Zoom calls at a record clip.But now, the tide has entirely turned. Zoom stock fell back to $180 by the end of 2021 as the surge in demand faltered. And in 2022, things went from bad to worse; ZM stock has plunged from $180 to just $78 today. Now, it’s as if the 2020 boom never happened at all; shares are only marginally above their pre-Covid levels.The thing is, a lot of Zoom’s new customers have stuck around. The company is actually quite profitable today. Analysts see the company earning $3.72 per share this year, which puts the company at less than 21-times forward earnings.The issue is that earnings are expected to be roughly flat into 2024 as the company deals with customer churn and slowing demand following the unprecedented demand in 2020 and 2021. However, the company’s earnings are strong enough here to support ZM stock at this price, and growth should return in due time once the economy picks back up. The move toward remote work has leveled off for now, but the longer-term trajectory remains upward for Zoom and video conferencing.Datadog (DDOG)The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a leading provider of monitoring and security services for cloud applications. The service operates across apps, networks, databases, code, workflow, servers, and many other locations. In all, Datadog aims to give its customers an all-in-one platform that works everywhere instead of being confined to certain use case silos.Datadog’s platform has been incredibly successful-to-date in terms of driving adoption. The company had just $101 million of revenues in 2017. By the end of 2021, it had grown to $1.0 billion, making for a quick tenfold jump. Analysts see the company’s revenues surging to $2.2 billion for full-year 2023.Unlike many SaaS companies, Datadog has achieved bottom line financial results to complement the top-line growth. It has, for example, put up a 26% free cash flow margin over the past 12 months. The company, while not tremendously profitable, does also consistently earn positive earnings per share which puts it ahead of many rivals. Datadog’s $1.7 billion of cash on hand also ensure that the company won’t need to raise money during these trying market conditions. For those seeking a pure hyper-growth play, Datadog looks like one of the eventual winners once sentiment recovers.Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comIn addition to most Nasdaq stocks, streaming media stocks have gotten absolutely hammered over the past 12 months. Video streaming has gone from boom to bust as subscriber numbers roll over. Turns out, as the economy has reopened, demand for home entertainment has cooled. The competition for the television screen is brutal with a seemingly unending stream of new services undercutting Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).It’s easy to paint the bear case for NFLX stock. However, people are throwing in the towel on the streaming giant too quickly. A look to past experience clarifies this. Doubters believed Netflix was collapsing in 2011 during its Qwikster debacle. That was when Netflix wanted to keep its DVD-by-mail service going through a subsidiary. Ultimately, the company was forced to reverse course, and critics believed taking the leap to a streaming-only model would crush the firm’s economics.NFLX stock plunged more than 75% peak-to-trough during the 2011 business model crisis. That said, Netflix ultimately recovered and people buying during the panic saw shares go up as much as 50-fold over the next decade.We’re seeing a similar slump in Netflix now as people question whether the company will ever be able to dominate its industry. But let’s consider some facts. The company is set to make more than $10/share in earnings this year. That’s a large number, and adds up to a P/E ratio of just 24. Hardly a disaster. And the company is generating $30 billion a year in subscriber revenues today. That’s plenty to be a highly successful business. Would it be great if Netflix can promptly return to subscriber growth? Of course. But at this price, Netflix stockholders can do just fine even if the business serves up flat results for another year or two.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a leader in the semiconductor industry and one of the top Nasdaq stocks on many investors’ radar. This company focuses on analog semiconductors, which are used in a variety of ways to convert real-world inputs such as wind speed or temperature into digital data, along with applications in fields such as audio and power systems.Analog is a great market, since it is more stable and slower-moving than other semiconductor fields. Texas Instruments can sell many of its designs for a decade or more, as opposed to semis for categories such as smartphones where the market changes radically every few years.Texas Instruments is in the sweet spot right now. Analog chips are vital for connected cars, internet of things applications, and other such niches with strong growth trajectories. Management’s focus on maximizing its free cash flow and hiking its dividend have proven shareholder-friendly during a time when so many other tech companies have failed to protect investors. All this makes TXN stock a great growth stock to own even as markets remain chaotic.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

We will see if performance momentum can be sustained following the company's quarterly results next week.PepsiCo benefits from the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit by delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. It raised its revenue view for 2022.However, it witnessed margin pressures in the second quarter driven by impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs.

(NYSE:TMO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-not-telling-story-thermo-140017024.html,1665324017,STORY,['TMO'],"[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") below 13x, you may consider Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 27.6x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Thermo Fisher Scientific could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Thermo Fisher Scientific will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Thermo Fisher Scientific's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 13%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 115% in total over the last three years. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 6.8% per year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth per year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.In light of this, it's alarming that Thermo Fisher Scientific's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 2 warning signs for Thermo Fisher Scientific that we have uncovered.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Thermo Fisher Scientific, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

But like candy corn or a fondant cake, remote work isn’t always as good as it looks.More than half (55%) of remote employees are highly anxious about their finances, according to a recent survey conducted by MetLife, which interviewed 1,000 full-time workers. That’s more than fully in-person or hybrid employees, 46% of whom feel similarly.For remote workers, the stress is becoming too much to handle. A slight majority (53%) predicted they’ll be at a financial “breaking point” soon. Only 41% of hybrid and in-person workers say the same.Part of the issue is benefit selection, when employees are deciding headache-inducing things like how much to contribute to their 401(k) plan and what health insurance plan has the best deductible. MetLife found that remote workers spend more time stressing about their benefits than their on-site or hybrid peers.That might be because they’re dealing with enrollment by themselves, without someone to talk to in person who can explain what such benefits mean. Such conversations could be more confusing over Zoom or Slack. Many noted to MetLife that if they understood the whole enrollment process they’d feel more financially secure.“During open enrollment, employees have to make decisions on a wide range of benefits, yet on average, people spend 17 or 18 minutes going through open enrollment,” Mona Zielke, senior operations and claim executive at Voya told Fortune in February, pointing out that people usually take more time deciding what show to watch.But they're also worried about what will happen to them if the economy takes a turn for the worst. Rumblings of economic instability and continuous layoffs have sparked concerns that remote workers will be on the chopping block: 78% of workers in the U.S. fear that remote workers are more likely to lose their jobs if a recession comes, according to GoodHire’s second annual “State of Remote Work” report.Story continuesTheir concerns about being out of sight, out of mind aren’t coming from nowhere in a workplace where proximity bias still exists; six in 10 managers told Beautiful.AI that they’ll lay off remote workers first in a recession. But it’s worth noting that while layoffs are playing out at big tech companies, job openings are still high, and despite the headlines, there aren’t major signs of mass layoffs coming soon.If a recession does, hit remote workers will all be in different ships depending on what industry they work in. But even so, many remote employees have the skills that are often in high demand these days, making it slightly easier to find themselves back on their feet if their fears of layoffs are true.“They have those digital skills as often because that’s what enables them to do their jobs remotely,"" Layla O’Kane, senior economist at Lightcast told Fortune. ""And they often have to work harder in communication and collaboration because they are working remotely.”Even so, whether it’s benefit selection or anxieties about impending layoffs, remote workers are squirming a bit on their couches.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com.]"

Other reports say that residential areas of Ukraine's capital Kyiv were hit by explosions on Monday morning, while social media posts suggest the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro were also hit by missile strikes.Elsewhere, Asian stocks dropped sharply, although trading volumes were muted due to holidays in Japan and South Korea.The blue-chip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index sank 2.21%, while the Shanghai Composite index shed 1.66%. Weighing on these markets were chipmaking stocks, including Anji Microelectronics Tech (SS:688019) and Chengdu Xuguang Electronics (SS:600353), which plummeted as much as 20% and 10% respectively, after the White House unveiled export controls cutting off Chinese companies from certain semiconductor materials made with U.S. equipment.European chipmakers Infineon Technologies AG (ETR:IFXGn) and BE Semiconductor Industries NV (AS:BESI) also slid in early dealmaking.The U.S. decision threatens to worsen trade ties between the two largest economies in the world and could have deeper economic implications if China responds.Story continuesSentiment towards China was also worsened by data over the weekend showing the country's services sector shrank in September, amid continued COVID-related disruptions. A recent resurgence in infections has also raised fears over more lockdowns.Oil prices edged down in the wake of these figures, although they remained supported by an OPEC+ supply cut last week and the looming prospect of further disruptions of key Russian energy flows.London-traded Brent Oil Futures slumped 0.64% to $97.29 a barrel, while U.S. Crude Oil WTI Futures fell by 0.63% to $92.06 per barrel.

West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $91.13 a barrel, losing $1.51, 1.6%. Both benchmarks had risen over the previous week largely on expectations of tightening global supply.Oil prices fell amid comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials about rising interest rates and their effect on the economy.Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said the economy is starting to feel more restrictive monetary policy, but the full brunt of the central bank's interest rate hikes will not be apparent for months.Brainard's comments followed remarks by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans that there was a strong consensus at the Fed to raise the target policy rate to around 4.5% by March and hold it there.""There's more of the doom and gloom from those folks and what they're going to do to the economy, because they're not so convinced they have inflation under control, and that's the macro play that's weighing on oil,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.Oil prices also struggled under a strengthening U.S. dollar, which rose for a fourth session. A stronger dollar makes crude more expensive for non-American buyers. [USD/]The prospect of tightening OPEC+ oil supplies limited declines in prices. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, together known as OPEC+, decided last week to lower their output target by 2 million barrels per day.But signs that the group's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, will continue to serve Asian customers at full levels lowered expectations of the cuts' impact.Saudi Aramco has told at least seven customers in Asia they will receive full contract volumes of crude oil in November ahead of the peak winter season, several sources with knowledge of the matter said.Story continues""OPEC+'s decision... will have a muted impact on the oil supply market as actual output cuts will be smaller,"" Fitch Ratings said, noting that collectively the group was already producing less than its previous quotas.Brent and WTI posted their biggest weekly percentage gains since March after the reduction was announced.However, the cut spurred a flurry of activity in the options market - but with more U.S. bettors opting for a bearish stance, data from CME Group showed.Concerns over still relatively robust demand as the pandemic has eased meeting potentially scarce supply have been deepened as the European Union late last week endorsed a G7 plan to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports.The complicated new sanctions package could end up shutting in considerable supplies of Russia crude, analysts have warned.Meanwhile, services activity in China during September contracted for the first time in four months as COVID-19 restrictions hit demand and business confidence, data showed on Saturday.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning, Florence Tan and Emily Chow; Editing by Mark Porter and Marguerita Choy)]"

Full stop.That's not a scare tactic so you share this newsletter with five friends. It's just the assessment of one person who has been doing this close to 20 years now. I think investors took too many hits on the ""hopium pipe"" (thanks RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas for this new fin-term for my vast arsenal) during the two-day, rip-your-face off rally to start the fourth quarter.Now, it's reality check time again as the high wears off.Here are a few risks barreling toward you...Inflation dataThis week, inflation data in the form of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), and price expectations from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are coming out. The CPI report is arguably the most important at the moment as investors look for signs that inflation is cooling at the hands of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes.The problem is that the CPI report isn't expected to slow much on a month-to- month basis. ""Core inflation continues to wield significant momentum,"" Wells Fargo Economist Sarah House pointed out in a client note.In turn, that sets the table for a harsh market reaction like what we saw on Friday to a too-hot September jobs report.Raw earnings numbersWarnings in recent weeks from AMD, Micron, Nike, FedEx highlight how crappy this earnings season will be. The negative reactions to those warnings underscore how the market hasn't truly priced in downside risks from the stronger dollar, still-high inflation, and the higher cost of capital.Story continuesThe ugliness of the top and bottom lines could surprise investors, even when considering expectations have been marked lower.Consensus expects 3% year-over-year EPS growth for S&amp;P 500 companies, 13% sales growth, and 75 basis points of margin contraction to 11.8%, according to data crunched by Goldman Sachs. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to fall by 3% and margins to contract by 132 basis points.I expect investors to be reminded of this new economic normal (which mirrors stagflation) in earnings out later this week from banks Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.Executive toneIf you hate listening to earnings calls, suck it up and get on them this earnings season. The economy is downshifting and you need every clue possible on companies to survive.I think the tones on conference calls will be decidedly bearish. Two good points on this one from Goldman Sachs:""Topics for managements to discuss: (1) headwind to sales due to a stronger U.S. dollar, (2) headwind to margins due to elevated inflation and high inventories, (3) tax changes effective in 2023."" All bearish topics.""Early guidance from managements has demonstrated the various headwinds to corporate profitability. CEO confidence for the six months ahead fell to levels last seen in 1980. Earlier in September, FedEx pre-announced a large EPS miss and withdrew 2023 guidance. More recently, Micron guided revenue and EPS below consensus expectations, citing uncertain demand and growing inventory. In addition, more than 10% of S&amp;P 500 market cap has pre-announced earnings this quarter, consistent with prior periods of high uncertainty as companies manage investor expectations."" Expect other companies to act in a similar fashion to these early reporters.On a more upbeat note, Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance Live demand for Corona and Modelo remain strong.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Eric Grossman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$102 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$78.93. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In total, Morgan Stanley insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Morgan Stanley insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$343m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Morgan Stanley Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Morgan Stanley shares in the last quarter.

(NYSE:CRM) institutional owners after losing 45% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-salesforce-110024522.html,1665399624,STORY,['CRM'],"[Every investor in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 4.5% increase in share prices after a year of 45% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Salesforce. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Salesforce. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 7.9%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore, CEO Marc Benioff is the owner of 2.8% of the company's shares.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can report that insiders do own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$4.7b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Salesforce. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Salesforce   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A slowing economy and the threat of recession make their stocks a riskier bet than usual, suggesting that the unwinding from the peak of pandemic-era speculation may not yet be done.A basket of money-losing tech companies compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has plunged 57% in 2022, including a drop of 0.3% on Monday. To compare, an exchange-traded fund focused on dividend-paying companies in the industry has fallen 22% on a total-return basis, and the Nasdaq 100 Index has dropped 32%.The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.1% on Monday.The drop has come as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises rates to fight inflation, a headwind to stocks that are priced on their prospects far out in the future. Goldman’s basket sank 6.7% on Friday, after a strong jobs report underlined that the Fed is likely to remain hawkish. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has jumped to almost 3.9%, more than double where it started the year.“Profitability has become much more important,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “There may come a time where unprofitable companies outperform again, but I don’t think Fed policy or the market backdrop will favor them anytime soon. I think they’re in for more pain until we see inflation moderate and the Fed slows its pace of hikes.”He favors companies with stable businesses and high visibility into profit streams, including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and Nvidia Corp.The focus on profitability represents a sharp about-face from pandemic-era trends, when ultra-low rates and economic stimulus fueled outperformance in hyper-growth stocks. Goldman’s basket soared more than 400% between a low in March 2020 and a peak hit less than a year later. It has since dropped 73% from the high.Story continuesAmong the unprofitable companies with the biggest stock declines this year are Unity Software Inc., Okta Inc. and Asana Inc., all down 68% or more.While the selloff has compressed price-earnings multiples, many unprofitable tech companies -- notably high-growth software stocks -- continue to trade at sky-high valuations. According to KeyBanc Capital Markets, software valuations remain above average in terms of enterprise value to free cash flow.In another risk, many unprofitable companies offer stock-based compensation packages to employees. This has become a headwind amid the market’s decline, as companies either have to issue more shares to keep talent, which dilutes the stakes of other investors, or they have to pay more in cash, a further drag on the bottom line.“There’s been a complete 180 in the market backdrop compared to 2020, with rates going up and the economy slowing,” said Patrick Burton, a portfolio manager at Winslow Capital Management, which oversees about $26 billion. “Not only has the cost of capital skyrocketed and the math stopped working for stock compensation, but these companies should see slower growth. That makes us think they have more room to drop.”Burton favors tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc., and said some chipmakers had become attractive given their year-to-date weakness.“We wouldn’t branch out into unprofitable tech,” he said. “Eventually, high-growth unprofitable stocks will come back, but we don’t expect that for a long time.”Tech Chart of the DayThe collapse in Meta Platforms Inc.’s stock shows no sign of stopping. The Facebook parent closed Friday at its lowest since January 2019, extending a slump that has erased 60% -- and about $577 billion -- off its market value this year. Last week’s drop of 1.6% represented its fourth straight negative week, and it stood in contrast to the gains posted by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Alphabet, as well as social-media peers Pinterest Inc., Snap Inc., and Twitter Inc.Top Tech StoriesThe Biden administration’s new restrictions on technology exports to China could undercut the country’s ability to develop wide swaths of its economy, from semiconductors and supercomputers to surveillance systems and advanced weapons.Chinese semiconductor stocks slumped after fresh US curbs on China’s access to American technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season, stoking concerns that the industry’s downturn is far from over.US restrictions on China’s access to advanced American technologies could slash growth of the country’s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., by half next year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.Twitter Inc. has restricted and locked the account of billionaire musician and fashion designer Kanye West, just one day after he returned to the social media platform for the first time in almost two years.

(NYSE:PAYC)Motley Fool Asset Management's Stake Value: $17,147,000Percentage of Motley Fool Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 1.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) is an American software company that provides HR payroll software and data analytics among other software products. The company is cash-rich and invests in itself. On August 15, Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) announced that it is increasing and extending its share repurchase program of $550 million by $1.1 billion. The new share repurchase program brings its existing authorization to $1.65 billion, which the company expects to complete by August 15, 2024. The company has free cash flows of $210.69 million.Wall Street is bullish on Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC). This August, KeyBanc analyst Jason Celino raised his price target on Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) to $432 from $390 and reiterated a buy-side Overweight rating on the shares. On September 1, Citi analyst Steven Enders started coverage of Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) with a Buy rating and a $457 price target. Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) is ranked among the top holdings of Motley Fool Asset Management and is among the best Motley Fool stocks to buy now.At the end of Q2 2022, 43 hedge funds were long Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) and held stakes worth $1.20 billion in the company. Of those, $17 million were of Motley Fool Asset Management Company. The investment covers 1.61% of the fund's 13F portfolio.Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:“We are short shares of Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC), a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year, Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow, a testament to the fact that, while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets, there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation, in particular, doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth, meaningful TAM saturation, and increasing competitive intensity.Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR, and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart, and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue, the company is a scaled business, and combined with Paylocity, Bamboo, and other dynamic tech companies in the sector, the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim, and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward.At the same time, ADP is fighting back, increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto, two rapidly growing startups in the space, have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations, and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough, US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip, which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s, price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about, but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM)Motley Fool Asset Management's Stake Value: $17,548,000Percentage of Motley Fool Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 1.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a cloud-computing company best known for its Jira software products.

Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability, combined with substantial R&amp;D investment, points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile, we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However, we believe its low priced, mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues, strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins, we added to our position.”8.

(NASDAQ:AXON) and has a stake worth $24 million in the company. The stock is one of the best Motley Fool stocks to buy now.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NYSE:AXON) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NYSE:AXON) is a public safety-oriented company that sells its products to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Its mission is to “…make the bullet obsolete” using non-lethal TASER® devices combined with digital cameras, cloud-based software, and virtual reality training. This array of technology aims to provide better relationships between law enforcement and its constituent communities, and to reduce fatal outcomes dramatically when stressful confrontations occur. Axon takes its mission seriously and has an extensive ethics committee that includes members of law enforcement and activist communities. Axon claims that with usage of body cameras, complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors.The company has three major product lines: first, high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second, subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody, search, and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third, non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258,000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination, its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming, while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future, Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed, drone-based camera products, more VR training, and additional cloud-based software, including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys, which could be a $1 billion market on its own.From a financial perspective, the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales, about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals, so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables, which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026), margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth, which was nearly 27% in 2021, should continue at over 20%, given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally, the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow), Axon has significant capital to grow its business, complete accretive acquisitions, and potentially return capital to shareholders.”6. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Motley Fool Asset Management's Stake Value: $32,694,000 Percentage of Motley Fool Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 3.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 137On September 19, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share of common stock.

Within Payments, lower exposure to this lagging theme and outperformance of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) added the most value. These global payment networks are viewed as safe havens during market downturns but are also benefiting from resilient payment volumes and a sharp rebound in international travel.”In addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), other highly profitable stocks among Motley Fool Asset Management's top holdings include Alphabet Inc.

ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Genpact Ltd. G.Industry: OutsourcingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1989079/3-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-outsourcing-industryOperational efficiency and reduced expenses in the wake of the coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave and increased adoption of cloud computing and other emerging technologies bode well for the Zacks Outsourcing industry. These drive competitive advantage, and increase innovation and speed-to-market.Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and Genpact Ltd. are some stocks that are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends. However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Industry DescriptionOutsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations, services or processes, previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources, to external resources or third-party contractors to improve operating efficiency by focusing on core business competencies. The Zacks Outsourcing industry comprises companies engaged in providing human capital management solutions, business management solutions and information technology solutions for human resource, payroll, benefits, and retirement and insurance services to small- and medium-sized businesses. Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Story continuesRising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Notably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Security Issues and Remedies: Increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, increased implementation of secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees on emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #40. This rank places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The buy-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been increasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has increased 4.7%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can buy given their growth prospects, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Outsourcing industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 3.3% over this period against a 43% decline of the broader sector and 14.9% decline of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing outsourcing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.19X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.2X and the sector’s 21.31X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.89X, as low as 17.89X and at the median of 23.58X.3 Outsourcing Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that are well positioned to grow in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Automatic Data Processing: This New Jersey-based company provides cloud-based human capital management solutions worldwide. ADP’s three-tier business strategy helps it maintain and grow its strong position as a human capital management (HCM) technology and services provider.The company is focused on delivering a complete suite of cloud-based HCM and HR Outsourcing solutions. Strategic acquisitions like Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company have strengthened ADP’s customer base and are helping it expand operations in international markets. It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADP’s 2022 EPS has moved up 3.2% in the past 90 days. ADP’s shares have rallied 13.2% over the past year.Paychex: This New York-based company provides integrated human capital management solutions.Paychex continues to benefit from growth in its payroll client bases and product penetration across HCM offerings, resulting from strong sales performance and high levels of retention, high demand for HR Solutions, improved revenues per client resulting from higher employment levels within the company’s client base and enhanced price realization, and expansion of HCM ancillary services.

27,1774e484-18bf-3275-9bbc-d346e801baca,PAYX,2022-10-10,7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy To Tap Into a Hidden Bull Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-nasdaq-stocks-buy-tap-191636879.html,1665083796,STORY,"['NFLX', 'MSFT', 'TXN', 'ADBE', 'PAYX', 'ADSK', 'DDOG', 'ZM']","[It’s been the worst year for Nasdaq stocks since the great financial crisis of 2008. While 2021 saw big sell-offs in weaker and more speculative companies, 2022 has seen nearly universal selling across the Nasdaq as investors abandon growth stocks.Many investors are understandably throwing in the towel on Nasdaq stocks. After such a bad run, people are rightly questioning many of the grand narratives that drove the previous bull market in the technology sector. On top of that, tailwinds associated with heightened digital adoption during the pandemic have long since reversed. Now layoffs and cutbacks are the order of the day across Silicon Valley.However, it’s not all bad news. In fact, for patient investors, the current chaos represents an opportunity. After seeing Nasdaq stocks soar to stratospheric levels last year, valuations have come back down to earth. Not all the growth stocks that have crashed will recover. Many firms had questionable business models or poor unit economics. There was a lot of speculative froth. However, the strongest growth stocks can consolidate during this down cycle and come out stronger. Astute investors can capitalize with these seven leading Nasdaq companies going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADSKAutodesk$205.60MSFTMicrosoft$246.81PAYXPaychex$111.93ZMZoom Video$77.89DDOGDatadog$93.81NFLXNetflix$240.87TXNTexas Intstruments$166.91Autodesk (ADSK)An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBig software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have become the latest victim of the ongoing selloff in technology stocks. Shares of leading graphics design company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) plummeted last month following its surprising and expensive acquisition of design firm Figma. Adobe’s plunge has set off a fresh round of selling in other leading SaaS giants including graphics peer Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK).However, Adobe’s problems don’t apply to ADSK stock. Autodesk’s usage base is much more tilted toward industrial, manufacturing, and infrastructure purposes. While Adobe is a creative platform widely used in media, video creation and the like, this is one of the top Nasdaq stocks to buy in terms of stability. Autodesk is much more clearly linked to less-volatile fields like vehicle design, factory management, and construction.Story continuesAs a result, Autodesk probably won’t need to make the same sort of splashy acquisitions that Adobe apparently views as essential. Meanwhile, Autodesk has already firmly crossed into strongly profitable territory. Shares sell for just 30 times forward earnings with analysts estimating 31% earnings per share growth in 2023. That’s a fine entry point.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comFor awhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appeared to be immune to the broader market sell-off. However, even MSFT stock has now gotten dragged into the mess.MSFT stock has now fallen 20% over the past six months and slipped to new 52-week lows at the end of September. Microsoft’s cash cow continues to be its dominant position with Windows and Office. However, the company’s Azure cloud computing business has revolutionized Microsoft’s outlook. Azure is already producing more than $40 billion per year in revenues and is still growing at more than 40% per year. It’s simply breathtaking success for a company of Microsoft’s size and age.Right now, Microsoft is selling off on fears that Azure will slow down as its clients pull back on spending. That’s a valid concern. But Microsoft is a cash flow machine. It’s also selling for less than 25-times forward earnings now, and earnings are still growing at a double-digit rate. Long story short, Microsoft is still a reliable blue chip growth stock option, and it’s now at its best entry point so far in 2022.Paychex (PAYX)Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhoneSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a software company focused on human resources services. The company helps firms with things such as payroll, as the name would suggest, along with benefits, insurance, and compliance.PAYX stock has slumped in part with the broader market and perhaps on concerns of a slowdown in the economy. However, investors should be aware that employment remains exceptionally strong; the U.S. unemployment rate is still at just 3.5%. This is well below the historical median. Demand for labor is also strong, and a quarter or two of weak economic output won’t change the country’s unusually strong outlook for employment too much.Paychex shares have dropped from $140 to around $110 over the past month or so. In doing so, the stock has fallen to near its 52-week-low. At this price, Paychex offers a 2.8% dividend yield on top of its consistent earnings growth record.Zoom Video (ZM)Zoom (ZM) logo on a buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comZoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) was one of the market’s hottest stocks in 2020. The video communications leader surged from around $70 a share to more than $500 during the pandemic. The company’s potential seemed limitless as companies, schools, and universities signed up for paid Zoom calls at a record clip.But now, the tide has entirely turned. Zoom stock fell back to $180 by the end of 2021 as the surge in demand faltered. And in 2022, things went from bad to worse; ZM stock has plunged from $180 to just $78 today. Now, it’s as if the 2020 boom never happened at all; shares are only marginally above their pre-Covid levels.The thing is, a lot of Zoom’s new customers have stuck around. The company is actually quite profitable today. Analysts see the company earning $3.72 per share this year, which puts the company at less than 21-times forward earnings.The issue is that earnings are expected to be roughly flat into 2024 as the company deals with customer churn and slowing demand following the unprecedented demand in 2020 and 2021. However, the company’s earnings are strong enough here to support ZM stock at this price, and growth should return in due time once the economy picks back up. The move toward remote work has leveled off for now, but the longer-term trajectory remains upward for Zoom and video conferencing.Datadog (DDOG)The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a leading provider of monitoring and security services for cloud applications. The service operates across apps, networks, databases, code, workflow, servers, and many other locations. In all, Datadog aims to give its customers an all-in-one platform that works everywhere instead of being confined to certain use case silos.Datadog’s platform has been incredibly successful-to-date in terms of driving adoption. The company had just $101 million of revenues in 2017. By the end of 2021, it had grown to $1.0 billion, making for a quick tenfold jump. Analysts see the company’s revenues surging to $2.2 billion for full-year 2023.Unlike many SaaS companies, Datadog has achieved bottom line financial results to complement the top-line growth. It has, for example, put up a 26% free cash flow margin over the past 12 months. The company, while not tremendously profitable, does also consistently earn positive earnings per share which puts it ahead of many rivals. Datadog’s $1.7 billion of cash on hand also ensure that the company won’t need to raise money during these trying market conditions. For those seeking a pure hyper-growth play, Datadog looks like one of the eventual winners once sentiment recovers.Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comIn addition to most Nasdaq stocks, streaming media stocks have gotten absolutely hammered over the past 12 months. Video streaming has gone from boom to bust as subscriber numbers roll over. Turns out, as the economy has reopened, demand for home entertainment has cooled. The competition for the television screen is brutal with a seemingly unending stream of new services undercutting Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).It’s easy to paint the bear case for NFLX stock. However, people are throwing in the towel on the streaming giant too quickly. A look to past experience clarifies this. Doubters believed Netflix was collapsing in 2011 during its Qwikster debacle. That was when Netflix wanted to keep its DVD-by-mail service going through a subsidiary. Ultimately, the company was forced to reverse course, and critics believed taking the leap to a streaming-only model would crush the firm’s economics.NFLX stock plunged more than 75% peak-to-trough during the 2011 business model crisis. That said, Netflix ultimately recovered and people buying during the panic saw shares go up as much as 50-fold over the next decade.We’re seeing a similar slump in Netflix now as people question whether the company will ever be able to dominate its industry. But let’s consider some facts. The company is set to make more than $10/share in earnings this year. That’s a large number, and adds up to a P/E ratio of just 24. Hardly a disaster. And the company is generating $30 billion a year in subscriber revenues today. That’s plenty to be a highly successful business. Would it be great if Netflix can promptly return to subscriber growth? Of course. But at this price, Netflix stockholders can do just fine even if the business serves up flat results for another year or two.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a leader in the semiconductor industry and one of the top Nasdaq stocks on many investors’ radar. This company focuses on analog semiconductors, which are used in a variety of ways to convert real-world inputs such as wind speed or temperature into digital data, along with applications in fields such as audio and power systems.Analog is a great market, since it is more stable and slower-moving than other semiconductor fields. Texas Instruments can sell many of its designs for a decade or more, as opposed to semis for categories such as smartphones where the market changes radically every few years.Texas Instruments is in the sweet spot right now. Analog chips are vital for connected cars, internet of things applications, and other such niches with strong growth trajectories. Management’s focus on maximizing its free cash flow and hiking its dividend have proven shareholder-friendly during a time when so many other tech companies have failed to protect investors. All this makes TXN stock a great growth stock to own even as markets remain chaotic.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

28,b38b3a9b-4ee1-3ee2-8231-bac43724fbf3,ADM,2022-10-10,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-archer-daniels-121822085.html,1665317902,STORY,['ADM'],"[How far off is Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.05bUS$2.75bUS$2.18bUS$2.11bUS$2.07bUS$2.06bUS$2.07bUS$2.08bUS$2.10bUS$2.13bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -1.67%Est @ -0.59%Est @ 0.17%Est @ 0.7%Est @ 1.07%Est @ 1.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$2.9kUS$2.5kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.1b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$38bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$56b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$85.4, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Archer-Daniels-Midland, there are three pertinent aspects you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Archer-Daniels-Midland has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is potentially serious)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does ADM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

In addition, sequential quarterly demand recovery was lower than expected in China due to a resumption of certain pandemic-related restrictions. The sales volume declines were most pronounced in September and resulted in a reduction in the earnings benefit from higher selling prices and reduced manufacturing efficiencies versus the prior forecast.Softer demand conditions are expected to continue into the fourth quarter along with continued higher levels of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Raw material cost inflation remains at historically elevated levels but has begun to moderate in some regions. The company is expecting selling prices to be up by between 10% and 12% compared to the prior-year fourth quarter, and up between 18% and 20% on a two-year stacked basis. The company anticipates fourth quarter year-over-year segment earnings growth of near 20%, as year-over-year segment margin recovery momentum accelerates.PPG’s reported fourth quarter 2021 earnings per diluted share were $1.12 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.26. Both the reported and adjusted figures included a $0.20 benefit from a lower tax rate related to favorable discrete items that are not expected to recur in the fourth quarter of 2022.The company will announce third quarter financial results and provide further information on expectations for the fourth quarter on October 19, following the close of the equity markets in the U.S. The company previously forecasted third quarter earnings per diluted share of between $1.60 and $1.85 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $1.75 and $2.00.Story continuesPPG: WE PROTECT AND BEAUTIFY THE WORLD™At PPG (NYSE:PPG), we work every day to develop and deliver the paints, coatings and materials that our customers have trusted for more than 135 years.

PPG is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the third quarter 2022 without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact such measure are uncertain or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. PPG’s management considers adjusted earnings per diluted share useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Adjusted earnings per diluted share as used by PPG in this press release may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and may be identified by their use of words like ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""will,"" ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""intends,"" ""projects,"" ""estimates"" or other words of similar meaning. The forward-looking statements contained herein include statements relating to sales volumes, margins and earnings, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to achieve selling price increases, business demand trends, and tax rates. These statements are based on information available to PPG as of the date hereof, and actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied, due to market conditions, as well as risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the pace of recovery from the pandemic, global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here, in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our June 30, 2022 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our other filings with the SEC, are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.All information in this release speaks only as of October 10, 2022 and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information.

31,ee48c43f-f3af-327a-9b86-aa0c1af044a7,GS,2022-10-10,Tech Earnings Matter More Than Ever as the Bubble Deflates,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-earnings-matter-more-ever-101957671.html,1665397197,STORY,['GS'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Investors in technology companies are focused more than ever on profits, following an era when low interest rates drove a speculative frenzy in money-losing companies.Unprofitable companies have underperformed this year and are likely to continue doing so, investors say. A slowing economy and the threat of recession make their stocks a riskier bet than usual, suggesting that the unwinding from the peak of pandemic-era speculation may not yet be done.A basket of money-losing tech companies compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has plunged 57% in 2022, including a drop of 0.3% on Monday. To compare, an exchange-traded fund focused on dividend-paying companies in the industry has fallen 22% on a total-return basis, and the Nasdaq 100 Index has dropped 32%.The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.1% on Monday.The drop has come as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises rates to fight inflation, a headwind to stocks that are priced on their prospects far out in the future.

That alone will help drive $600 million in advertising sales in 2023 for the segment. Anmuth expects those numbers to swell by 2026 as Netflix's execution on selling ads improves.By 2026, Anmuth thinks Netflix's US/Canada segment will boast 22 million subscribers and drive $2.65 billion in advertising sales.Optimism on Wall Street regarding the financial impact of Netflix's looming ad-tier has greatly supported the stock in recent months. Shares of the streaming giant are up 19% in the past three months, out-performing the S&amp;P 500's 4% drop.""Given Netflix's recently muted sub growth, advertising is critical to re-accelerating revenue, expanding Netflix's SAM [subscription addressable market], and driving greater profitability,"" explained Anmuth.""The Netflix narrative has shifted from slow/no sub growth on the current business to advertising and paid sharing coming in 2023.""To Anmuth's point, the first half of 2022 has been un-Netflix like — factors that have led to the stock plunging 63% year to date.The company shed more than one million paid subscribers in the first two quarters of the year as the economy slowed and consumers cutback. Becoming more mobile post COVID-19 pandemic has also weighed on subscriber trends for Netflix, as has been the rising of competing streaming platforms from Disney and Paramount.But there is a real chance for Netflix to make a meaningful business by offering an ad-supported pricing tier for consumers, Cowen analyst John Blackledge says. Hence, Netflix's shares have come back alive.""I think it will be a net-net-incremental [positive],"" Blackledge said on Yahoo Finance Live.

But it also found that banks are slowing the trend by partnering with larger banks who have already built connections to fintechs.The report – The Forces Disrupting Payments – showed that banks, community banks and credit unions continue to be at risk of disintermediation – when businesses circumvent their banks by engaging directly with fintechs – with only a third of businesses surveyed believing their FIs fully understand their payment needs. In fact, 62% of the business respondents said they are already working with a fintech provider.Overall, however, businesses said that they would rather partner with another bank than have to seek third-party fintech providers. Smaller banks, in particular, are finding it beneficial to partner with larger FIs that have already vetted and validated the numerous fintech payment options available.""Banks need to solve for points of friction as their business customers show a greater expectation for robust, real-time capabilities,"" says Isabel Schmidt, Co-Head of Global Payments at BNY Mellon. ""Our experience is that clients who partner with financial institutions that are connected to fintechs and their capabilities stand a greater chance of success.""""The threat of disintermediation is the impetus for a lot of innovation among banks as they collaborate with fintechs on new ways to drive growth,"" says Erika Baumann, author of the report at Aite-Novarica Group. ""This leads to a market opportunity for fintechs, as well as FIs that have reacted to market demand by developing robust services to fill the biggest gaps in their payment strategies.""The report also reveals that 87% of businesses have made significant or somewhat significant investments in improving their own organization's payments technology or processes. Despite this, those still planning to make an investment is still very high (88%), presenting an abundance of market opportunities for fintechs and FIs who, together, come to market with effective, comprehensive payment services that can cater to a spectrum of client needs.Story continuesThe findings of the report – produced in collaboration with Aite – are based on feedback from a survey of 790 employees of midsized and large organizations in seven North American and European countries.ABOUT BNY MELLON BNY Mellon is a global investments company dedicated to helping its clients manage and service their financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle.

A slowing economy and the threat of recession make their stocks a riskier bet than usual, suggesting that the unwinding from the peak of pandemic-era speculation may not yet be done.A basket of money-losing tech companies compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has plunged 57% in 2022, including a drop of 0.3% on Monday. To compare, an exchange-traded fund focused on dividend-paying companies in the industry has fallen 22% on a total-return basis, and the Nasdaq 100 Index has dropped 32%.The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.1% on Monday.The drop has come as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises rates to fight inflation, a headwind to stocks that are priced on their prospects far out in the future.

The Biden administration’s latest curbs encompass three broad categories, though questions remain about their scope and final impact, as well as Washington’s ability to enforce them. These include:1. Ban on the shipment of chips for AI and high-performance computing, plus gear that can used to manufacture such semiconductors.The new restrictions, first announced by Nvidia in exchange filings in September, are intended to sever the flow of US know-how to China’s military and surveillance systemsThey will hurt Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s business in China, in particularIt’s unclear whether the bans may curtail the flow of older chips, which can be upgraded or modified for use in modern AI computingChina’s AI chipmakers, including Biren, may face some restrictions on outsourcing production to TSMCIt’s unclear if restrictions extend to older-generation equipment from non-American firms such as ASML Holding NV and Tokyo Electron Ltd. More mature-generation gear can in theory be used to produce current-generation components.Story continues2. Chipmaking gear restrictions that cover production of both logic and memory chips. The ban now encompasses tools for:Logic chips using so-called nonplanar transistors made with 16-nanometer technology or anything more advanced than that. Generally speaking, the smaller the nanometers, the more capable the chip18-nanometer dynamic random access memory chipsNand-style flash memory chips with 128 layers or moreForeign companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. can apply for licenses to continue acquiring machinery they need for their plants in ChinaThe new rules also cover broad, de facto prohibitions on US persons “supporting” the development or manufacture of chips covered by the restrictions.3.

That more severe step effectively blocks companies from buying US technologyIt strikes directly at Beijing’s multibillion-dollar effort to build a world-class semiconductor industry and replace American technology.

We picked the top 11 holdings and ranked them in increasing order of Motley Fool Asset Management's stake in them.Best Motley Fool Stocks To Buy Now11. Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC)Motley Fool Asset Management's Stake Value: $17,147,000Percentage of Motley Fool Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 1.61%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) is an American software company that provides HR payroll software and data analytics among other software products. The company is cash-rich and invests in itself. On August 15, Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) announced that it is increasing and extending its share repurchase program of $550 million by $1.1 billion. The new share repurchase program brings its existing authorization to $1.65 billion, which the company expects to complete by August 15, 2024. The company has free cash flows of $210.69 million.Wall Street is bullish on Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC). This August, KeyBanc analyst Jason Celino raised his price target on Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) to $432 from $390 and reiterated a buy-side Overweight rating on the shares. On September 1, Citi analyst Steven Enders started coverage of Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) with a Buy rating and a $457 price target. Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) is ranked among the top holdings of Motley Fool Asset Management and is among the best Motley Fool stocks to buy now.At the end of Q2 2022, 43 hedge funds were long Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) and held stakes worth $1.20 billion in the company. Of those, $17 million were of Motley Fool Asset Management Company. The investment covers 1.61% of the fund's 13F portfolio.Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:“We are short shares of Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC), a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year, Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow, a testament to the fact that, while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets, there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation, in particular, doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth, meaningful TAM saturation, and increasing competitive intensity.Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR, and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart, and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue, the company is a scaled business, and combined with Paylocity, Bamboo, and other dynamic tech companies in the sector, the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim, and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward.At the same time, ADP is fighting back, increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto, two rapidly growing startups in the space, have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations, and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough, US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip, which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s, price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about, but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM)Motley Fool Asset Management's Stake Value: $17,548,000Percentage of Motley Fool Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 1.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a cloud-computing company best known for its Jira software products.

Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability, combined with substantial R&amp;D investment, points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile, we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However, we believe its low priced, mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues, strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins, we added to our position.”8.

(NASDAQ:AXON) and has a stake worth $24 million in the company. The stock is one of the best Motley Fool stocks to buy now.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NYSE:AXON) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NYSE:AXON) is a public safety-oriented company that sells its products to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Its mission is to “…make the bullet obsolete” using non-lethal TASER® devices combined with digital cameras, cloud-based software, and virtual reality training. This array of technology aims to provide better relationships between law enforcement and its constituent communities, and to reduce fatal outcomes dramatically when stressful confrontations occur. Axon takes its mission seriously and has an extensive ethics committee that includes members of law enforcement and activist communities. Axon claims that with usage of body cameras, complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors.The company has three major product lines: first, high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second, subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody, search, and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third, non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258,000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination, its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming, while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future, Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed, drone-based camera products, more VR training, and additional cloud-based software, including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys, which could be a $1 billion market on its own.From a financial perspective, the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales, about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals, so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables, which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026), margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth, which was nearly 27% in 2021, should continue at over 20%, given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally, the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow), Axon has significant capital to grow its business, complete accretive acquisitions, and potentially return capital to shareholders.”6. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Motley Fool Asset Management's Stake Value: $32,694,000 Percentage of Motley Fool Asset Management's 13F Portfolio: 3.07%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 137On September 19, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.49 per share of common stock.

As of June 30, Motley Fool Asset Management's stake in the company is valued at $32.69 million. The investment covers 3.07% of the fund's 13F portfolio.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The Fund’s holdings in the Payments and Information Services themes also contributed to relative performance. Within Payments, lower exposure to this lagging theme and outperformance of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) added the most value. These global payment networks are viewed as safe havens during market downturns but are also benefiting from resilient payment volumes and a sharp rebound in international travel.”In addition to Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), other highly profitable stocks among Motley Fool Asset Management's top holdings include Alphabet Inc.

And dividend investors don’t often think about tech stocks. However, there are undervalued tech stocks with dividends that are worth focusing on.In fact, there are a handful of tech stocks with low valuations and attractive dividends. Of course, not all tech stocks with nice dividends are worth buying, but a handful of them certainly are.As investors continue to fish for a low in the stock market, many of these stocks are worth buying on pullbacks by the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegardless of what the Fed is doing or how stocks are trading, businesses in the U.S. remain relatively healthy. Although the demand for their  products and services is easing somewhat, they are generally holding up well.Let’s look at several tech stocks with dividends right now.TickerCompanyCurrent PriceAVGOBroadcom$448IBMInternational Business Machines$135INTCIntel$27.80HPEHewlett Packard Enterprise$13.80CSCOCisco Systems$43.65Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comChip stocks have had a hard time recently, as this group has been pulverized in 2022. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a name worth considering.At its current prices, Broadcom offers a unique combination of stability, value and yield.Analysts, on average, expect AVGO to deliver 21% revenue growth this year and 6% growth next year. That’s alongside average forecasts calling for 34% and 8% earnings growth this year and next year, respectively.Broadcom is trading at an attractive 12 times this year’s earning. While it’s possible that analysts’ mean forecasts won’t prove accurate, the fact that analysts are upbeat on AVGO is positive.Add in the stock’s 3.5% dividend yield, and  AVGO is poised to succeed. If AVGO stock revisits the low $400s, it will be hard to ignore.Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: International Business Machines (IBM)The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.Source: Twin Design / Shutterstock.comStory continuesSo many investors are obsessed with tech stocks, but most of them overlook the dinosaurs of the sector. One such dinosaur is International Business Machines (NASDAQ:IBM).No one seems to give this stock any love, yet they are ignoring the obvious: IBM has been a relative strength leader!Given that fact, it may be an under-the-radar find for some investors.Analysts, on average, expect 5% revenue growth from IBM this year alongside 15% earnings growth. That’s very high for IBM, as those who have followed this stock for the last decade know. As for next year, analysts expect about 6% earnings growth on sub-1% revenue growth.At current prices, investors are paying about 15 times earnings and collecting a 4.8% dividend yield. When I last looked at IBM stock about a month ago, it had a lower valuation and a higher yield, but the stock has rallied more than 13% since thenFor the year, the shares are now up about  1% versus the Nasdaq’s 33% decline. Over the last 12 months, IBM is up 11.5% while the Nasdaq is down 35%.How’s that for outperformance?Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Intel (INTC)intel stockSource: canon_shooter / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has  been around forever and will likely remain around forever. However, its longevity can’t mask reality, which is rather bleak for the chipmaker at the moment.Intel is not growing, as shown by its 15.5% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3. The sharp drop of global PC sales, identified by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). may continue.Analysts’ estimates of Intel’s revenue growth could be better, but it has a 5.2% dividend yield and a healthy payout ratio. It recently raised more cash via the Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) IPO, while INTC still holds some MBLY stock, and INTC will benefit if MBLY rises further.All that said, I would love to see Intel fall below $25 before buying it. After the shares’ recent rally, their valuation is no longer as attractive as it once was. Plus, as we’re hearing from other semiconductor and chip companies, the sector is not doing well.But Intel will survive the test of time.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockPCs may be a problem, but not for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). This company, is focused on “a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.”That puts it in a different position than HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and leaves it in a well-suited to focus on other areas of tech. Unfortunately however,, growing has not been easy for HPE.Analysts expect mild revenue and profit growth this year and next year, but on the plus side, their average estimates do call for top-and bottom-line gains. Further, the shares trade at a meager seven times earnings.Consequently, HPE stock, which pays a 3.5% dividend yield, may be worth watching.Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comFinally, we have Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). While it was a darling of investors during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago, that has not been the case in recent years. Cisco has performed okay, but it has been anything but a runaway train.However, Cisco may be worth an extra look amid the current downtrend.Worth noting is that the stock trades at just 12.5 times this year’s earnings estimates and pays a 3.4% dividend yield. Cisco is not the most exciting name on this list, but its dependability and low valuation are worth focusing on.On average, analysts expect 5% earnings and revenue growth from CSCO this year. However, in 2023, analysts’ mean outlook call for 7% earnings growth on and just 4% revenue growth. If CSCO can deliver that type of mid-level growth alongside a solid yield, then we may see the stock push higher over time.A decline of the shares below $40 would have my attention even more.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Luxfer LXFR, Bank OZK OZK, The First of Long Island FLIC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Honeywell International HON.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Watch on Recent Dividend Hikes as Rates RiseThe Federal Reserve, in its effort to fight inflation, increased the interest rate by 75 basis points yet again in its last meeting in September. The inflation data commonly, represented by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rose 0.1% for the month of August after remaining unchanged from July, mostly because of the increasing prices of goods and services, including rents, food and healthcare.Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in his speech that the central bank would continue with its hawkish stance to bring inflation to its desired level of around 2%. Investors are now worried that the Fed’s aggressive tightening measures to curb inflation might derail economic growth in the near future. The impact of rising interest rates will increase the cost of borrowing, which will have a spiraling impact on consumer spending and unemployment. It will thus slow down economic growth, which may force the economy toward a recession.The broader index continues to bleed lately, with the S&amp;P 500, the DOW &amp; the Nasdaq declining 21.44%, 17.64%, and 29.22%, respectively, so far this year. The rising global geo-political tensions between Russia-Ukraine and China-Taiwan continue to dent investors’ sentiment.Thus, investors who wish to park their money to earn a sizable income in such a gloomy environment may keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks. These dividend stocks hold a long track of profitability and have a proven business model that helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions. Due to their matured business models, investors can expect a steady flow of income along with higher protection of capital against wild swings in their prices. It is often seen that companies that reward shareholders with a comparatively high dividend payout tend to outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.Story continuesOn that note, let us look at companies like Luxfer, Bank OZK, The First of Long Island, Lockheed Martin and Honeywell International that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Luxfer is a materials technology company, specializing in the design, manufacture and supply of high-performance materials, components and gas cylinders.

57,f30d88ac-c73d-335c-8a8e-268ffcd501a9,LMT,2022-10-10,Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $3.00,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-nyse-lmt-increasing-143526165.html,1665326126,STORY,['LMT'],"[The board of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $3.00 on the 30th of December, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.0%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Lockheed Martin's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 66.8%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 42% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendLockheed Martin Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $4.00 total annually to $12.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Lockheed Martin Could Grow Its DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Lockheed Martin has grown earnings per share at 6.4% per year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.Lockheed Martin Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

KR, General Mills GIS and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ.Sail Through Rough Waters with These 3 Low-Beta StocksWhen looking for safe places to park cash during heightened volatility, targeting low-beta stocks is an excellent strategy that investors can deploy.Beta is a measure of a stock's systematic risk, or volatility, compared to the market as a whole. Generally, the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Stocks with a beta higher than 1.0 are more sensitive to the market’s movements, while those with a beta less than 1.0 are less susceptible.For those seeking shelter from volatility, three stocks – The Kroger Co., General Mills and Johnson &amp; Johnson – would be great places to start.On top of carrying a beta of less than 1.0, all three have rock-solid dividend metrics, a significant positive that helps alleviate drawdowns in other positions.All three have widely outperformed the general market in 2022, indicating that buyers have defended the stocks at a much higher level than most.Let’s take a deeper look at each one.General MillsGeneral Mills is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We see their products on nearly every shelf.GIS carries a beta of 0.32.The company has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions as of late, helping push the company into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).For those seeking an income stream, General Mills has that covered; the company’s annual dividend yields a rock-solid 2.8% paired with a payout ratio sitting at 53% of earnings.The company’s annual dividend yield is just a tick below the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector average of 2.9%.Further, GIS is forecasted to grow at an inspiring pace – earnings are forecasted to grow 3.6% in FY23 and a further 6.6% in FY24.Story continuesThe earnings growth comes on top of forecasted revenue increases of 2.8% and 2.2% for FY23 and FY24, respectively.Johnson &amp; JohnsonHeadquartered in New Jersey, Johnson &amp; Johnson is an American multinational corporation that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.JNJ carries a beta of 0.56.Johnson &amp; Johnson has been heavily dedicated to rewarding its shareholders; the company is a member of the elite Dividend King club, upping its dividend payout for a mind-boggling 60 consecutive years.The company’s annual dividend yields a sizable 2.8%, notably higher than its Zacks Medical sector average of 1.5%.JNJ has an impressive earnings track record – the company hasn’t reported earnings below the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate dating all the way back to 2012. Just in its latest print, JNJ penciled in a marginal 0.8% bottom line beat.Sales results have also been commendable, with JNJ exceeding revenue estimates in seven of its last ten quarterly reports.In addition, JNJ shares appear reasonably priced, further bolstered by its Style Score of a B for Value.Shares trade at a 16.0X forward earnings multiple, a few notches below their five-year median of 16.8X and representing a sizable 24% discount relative to their Zacks Medical sector.The Kroger Co. Founded in 1883, the long-time retailer operates approximately 2,700 retail stores under various banners and divisions in 35 states.KR has a beta of 0.51.Like General Mills, analysts have been bullish on Kroger’s near-term earnings outlook over the last several months, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).KR shares are cheap; the company’s 10.8X forward earnings multiple is nicely below its 12.6X five-year median and reflects a steep 55% discount relative to its Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.For the cherry on top, KR rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend that yields a respectable 2.4%, notably higher than its Zacks Sector average of 1%. KR’s dividend growth is even more impressive – the company has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years, paired with a double-digit 13.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineWith the market sailing through a historically-volatile year, it goes without saying that adding some defensive stocks would benefit investors.Low-beta stocks are a great way to shield yourself against volatility, as they are less susceptible to the market’s moves.Of course, some gains could be missed, but defense wins ballgames.For those searching for low-beta stocks with solid dividend payouts, all three stocks deserve consideration.Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

If you want to see some more of the best fundamental stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy.A good fundamentals stock is a stock of a company that's profitable and that has durable competitive advantages to maintain its profitability over time and to grow. Ideally that company would also be well run and have substantial growth opportunities in its future. That company would have scale and a strong history of earnings.Furthermore the best fundamental stocks would also include those aforementioned companies that also trade for a potential discount to their long term value. In terms of metrics, indicators such as a strong history of profits and history of returning profits back to shareholders is important. A history of dividends can also help.Currently, the market is facing several headwinds including rising interest rates and also a potentially slowing economy. Despite the economy potentially slowing, inflation is still a problem as well.Due to all the headwinds, the market has declined substantially with even many of the leading high quality stocks down over 20%+ year to date. In terms of the major indexes, the NASDAQ is down around 32%, the S&amp;P 500 is down around 23.6% and the Dow Jones is down around 19.3%.While the market could decline further given geopolitical events or if the economic data fails to meet expectations, there is also potential opportunity for long term investors to buy quality stocks.In the long term, quality companies with strong fundamentals could increase their earnings over time and potentially be worth more in times when the market is more bullish in terms of valuations on earnings.Given the market decline, the stocks of many quality companies are on sale, and there are several companies that could potentially fit in the list of the 10 best fundamentals stocks to buy.Where to Invest?Copyright: hin255 / 123RF Stock PhotoStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy, we used subjective measures to pick 10 stocks that have a strong history of quality earnings that also trade for reasonable valuations.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database who held shares in the stocks at the end of Q2.10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy10.

This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade prior to the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.”Stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

""Great apes die from heart disease just like people do.""Heart disease is the leading cause of death among apes living in zoos. The Columbus Zoo, in conjunction with the Great Ape Heart Project based in Detroit, implanted the monitors in two gorillas, two orangutans, and for the first time in the world, two bonobos.Bonobos share more than 98% of the same DNA as humans. All six apes implanted with Reveal LINQ are experiencing symptoms of heart disease.""These devices will provide the ability to monitor the apes in real time and adjust medications as needed, to make sure we're providing the best care to these animals through all their years,"" said Dr. Priya Bapodra-Villaverde, Columbus Zoo senior veterinarian. ""Not only are these procedures a breakthrough for these six individual great apes, but the cardiac monitors will also provide critical knowledge to advance veterinary care for their species.""Reveal LINQ is about one third the size of a AAA battery. Implanted under the skin, it can monitor a patient's heart 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for several years. The system records heart activity and sends data to the patient's doctor - or veterinarian - alerting them to any detected abnormal heart rhythms.""The data we collect will be included in the world's largest data base of cardiac health-related data in great apes,"" said Dr. Marietta Danforth of the Great Ape Heart Project. ""This information is on gorillas, orangutans, bonobos and chimpanzees worldwide amongst zoos, and allows us to look at trends over time.""Story continuesMedtronic is a long-time partner of the Great Ape Project and donated 40 ICMs to the effort. Similar procedures will take place at several more U.S. zoos in the coming months.In addition to great apes, Reveal LINQ devices are helping monitor the hearts of gray and maned wolves, mountain lions, oryx, Svalbard reindeer, mule deer, jaguars and bears (""How healthcare technology is changing wildlife conservation."").In total, Medtronic has supported research in 20 different species to date with additional species planned in 2023.""Our Mission, to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life, goes beyond creating medical devices to improve human life,"" said Tim Laske, vice president of research in the Medtronic Cardiac Ablation Solutions Operating Unit.

The trial met its primary efficacy outcome measure, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD, which measures how far patients can walk in 6 minutes) from baseline at 24 weeks. Eight of nine secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement (defined as improvement in 6MWD, improvement in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, and either improvement in WHO FC or maintenance of WHO FC II), and the outcome measure of time to death or the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event (TTCW). The Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT®, which was assessed as the ninth and final secondary outcome measure, did not achieve statistical significance. The overall safety profile of sotatercept in STELLAR was in general consistent with what has been observed in Phase 2. Results from the study will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress.""In the Phase 3 STELLAR study, sotatercept added to currently approved background therapy showed a profound effect on the primary efficacy outcome measure of improvement from baseline to 24 weeks in six-minute walk distance. The results from the secondary efficacy outcomes, including a favorable benefit seen in patients’ time to a clinical-worsening event, are especially noteworthy,"" said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We believe that in totality, the results observed in the STELLAR study suggest that sotatercept has the potential to transform the treatment of patients with PAH. We are moving with urgency on our regulatory applications to bring this investigational therapy to these patients.""Story continuesAbout STELLARSTELLAR (NCT04576988) is a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sotatercept compared to placebo, as an add-on to background therapy for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group 1). The primary endpoint is exercise capacity, as measured by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) 24 weeks following initiation of treatment. Nine secondary outcome measures were assessed: proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement (consisting of improvement in 6MWD, improvement in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, and either improvement in WHO FC or maintenance of WHO FC II); change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR); change from baseline in NT-proBNP levels; proportion of participants who improved in WHO FC; time to death or the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event (TTCW); proportion of participants who maintained or achieved a low risk score using the simplified French Risk score calculator; change from baseline in the Physical Impacts domain score of PAH; change from baseline in the Cardiopulmonary Symptoms domain score of PAH-SYMPACT®; and change from baseline in the Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain score of PAH-SYMPACT®.About pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive and life-threatening blood vessel disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries and elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Currently, an estimated 40,000 people in the U.S. and 30,000 people in the European Union are living with PAH and the disease progresses rapidly for many patients despite current standard of care treatment. PAH results in significant strain on the heart, leading to limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy. The 5-year mortality rate for patients with PAH is approximately 43 percent.About sotaterceptSotatercept is an investigational, potential first-in-class activin receptor type IIA-Fc (ActRIIA-Fc) fusion protein in development for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group 1). Sotatercept was designed to rebalance pro-proliferative (ActRIIA/Smad2/3-mediated) and anti- proliferative (BMPRII/Smad1/5/8-mediated) signaling associated with pulmonary arterial wall and right ventricular remodeling.Sotatercept has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as Priority Medicines designation by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of PAH.Merck acquired exclusive rights to sotatercept in the pulmonary hypertension field through the acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Southern hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Southern peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Southern will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?Southern's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 4.2%. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 33% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 14% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Southern's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that Southern maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Southern  that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

70,6129c3c4-96d5-30ea-9af9-1f98230542c3,CI,2022-10-10,Cigna's (NYSE:CI) 25% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same three-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cignas-nyse-ci-25-cagr-120045589.html,1665403245,STORY,['CI'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) share price is up 89% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 21% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 43% in the last year , including dividends .Since the stock has added US$3.3b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Cigna While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Cigna achieved compound earnings per share growth of 15% per year. In comparison, the 24% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Cigna's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Cigna the TSR over the last 3 years was 95%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cigna shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 43% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 10% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cigna better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Cigna that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Constant geopolitical concerns and rising defense budgets around the world provide a strong backdrop for the biggest defense companies.The major defense companies have sustainable dividends, even during recessions, due to the persistent need for global defense. In turn, investors have generated strong returns from defense stocks, as well as steady dividend growth each year.This article will discuss three top defense stocks for dividend growth investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNOCNorthrop Grumman$485.68LMTLockheed Martin$400.19RTXRaytheon Technologies$84.38Northrop Grumman (NOC)A photograph of the underside of a Northrop Grumman stealth bomber.Source: Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is a major defense company with four business segments: aeronautics systems (aircraft and UAVs), mission systems (radars, sensors and systems for surveillance and targeting), defense systems (sustainment and modernization, directed energy, tactical weapons), and space systems (missile defense, space systems, hyper-sonics and space launchers). The company generates over $35 billion in annual revenue.Northrop Grumman’s revenue fell 4% in the most recent quarter, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined 6%. Still, the company remained highly profitable, and future growth is likely as NOC won $13 billion billion in contracts in the second quarter. Its total backlog is at approximately $80 billion, of which $34 billion is currently funded.For full-year 2022, management expects $36.2 billion to $36.6 billion in revenue, along with adjusted EPS of at least $24.50.Northrop Grumman’s earnings have increased substantially over time, driven by top-line growth from contract wins, modernization and upgrades, services, and acquisitions. A significant reduction in share count has helped drive EPS gains as well.Looking forward, the company will achieve both revenue and EPS growth through its involvement in the F-35, B-2, E2-2D, B-21, and space platforms.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman has paid a growing dividend for 19 years. The payout ratio is currently low at approximately 18% so there is room for further increases. The stock currently yields 1.4%.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130J Super Hercules of the United States Air Force performing at Aero India 2017.Source: Joe Ravi / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the world’s largest defense company and a great pick among dividend stocks. It derives roughly 60% of its revenue from the U.S. Department of Defense. Other U.S. government agencies represent 10% of revenue, with 30% from international clients. The company consists of four business segments. Aeronautics, which produces military aircraft like the F-35, F-22, F-16 and C-130, is the biggest segment at 40% of sales. The rotary and mission systems represents 26% of sales and produces combat ships, naval electronics and helicopters. The company also operates a missiles and fire control business and a space systems segment.In the second quarter, net sales fell 9%. The quarter was impacted by lower sales in all segments. Still, Lockheed Martin expects annual revenue of $65.25 billion and EPS of $21.55 for the full year.We expect the company to generate 6% annual EPS growth over the next five years. Lockheed Martin’s backlog is approximately $134.6 billion with an increase in missiles and fire controls, space and rotary, and mission systems. EPS have grown in recent years on the strength of the F-35, tactical and strike missiles, satellite and missile defense programs, and the Sikorsky acquisition. The F-35 is one of the most advanced stealth military aircraft in the world and will likely drive growth for the long term. The Pentagon plans to buy 2,456 F-35s, and this does not include sales to allies.Lockheed Martin is an entrenched military prime contractor. It produces aircraft and other platforms that serve as the backbone for the U.S. military and other militaries around the world. This leads to a competitive advantage as any new technologies would have to significantly outperform extant platforms. These platforms have decades-long life cycles. Additionally, Lockheed Martin has the expertise and experience to perform sustainment and modernization. These characteristics lead to a good degree of recession resistance.The company has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 2.9%.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) was formed after the merger of two previously independent industrial giants, Raytheon and United Technologies. The combined company then spun off Carrier (CARR) and Otis (OTIS), which now trade on their own. Raytheon Technologies is one the largest aerospace and defense companies in the world with $64 billion in 2021 sales.The company has four segments: Collins Aerospace Systems, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space and Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense. Raytheon has performed relatively well over the course of 2022 compared to its peers, with steady growth in revenue. For example, last quarter, revenue grew 2.7% to $16.3 billion. Adjusted EPS of $1.16 rose 12.6% year-over-year. Revenue grew 10% and 16% in the Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney segments, respectively.We expect Raytheon Technologies to grow its EPS by 7% per year over the next five years. The company backlog at the end of the quarter was $161 billion, compared to $154 billion in the 2022 first quarter, of which $96 billion was from commercial aerospace and $65 billion was from defense. Raytheon Technologies reaffirmed prior guidance for 2022, with the company still expecting sales of $67.75 billion to $68.75 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.80.The company continues to generate growth, which, in turn, means rising dividends for shareholders. In April 2022, Raytheon Technologies increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to 55 cents per share. Both United Technologies and Raytheon have put together solid operating records. In the last decade United Technologies grew EPS by an average rate of 7.2%, while increasing its dividend for 28 years prior to the merger. The stock has a current dividend yield of 2.7%.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:NKE) Might Be Difficult",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/getting-cheap-nike-inc-nyse-120148820.html,1665403308,STORY,['NKE'],"[NIKE, Inc.'s (NYSE:NKE) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 24.2x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 13x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.NIKE hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for NIKE peKeen to find out how analysts think NIKE's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?NIKE's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 7.1%. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 32% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why NIKE is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of NIKE's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.The money you have invested in the stock market is at big risk of being further vaporized in the remaining weeks of October. Full stop.That's not a scare tactic so you share this newsletter with five friends. It's just the assessment of one person who has been doing this close to 20 years now. I think investors took too many hits on the ""hopium pipe"" (thanks RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas for this new fin-term for my vast arsenal) during the two-day, rip-your-face off rally to start the fourth quarter.Now, it's reality check time again as the high wears off.Here are a few risks barreling toward you...Inflation dataThis week, inflation data in the form of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), and price expectations from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are coming out. The CPI report is arguably the most important at the moment as investors look for signs that inflation is cooling at the hands of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes.The problem is that the CPI report isn't expected to slow much on a month-to- month basis. ""Core inflation continues to wield significant momentum,"" Wells Fargo Economist Sarah House pointed out in a client note.In turn, that sets the table for a harsh market reaction like what we saw on Friday to a too-hot September jobs report.Raw earnings numbersWarnings in recent weeks from AMD, Micron, Nike, FedEx highlight how crappy this earnings season will be. The negative reactions to those warnings underscore how the market hasn't truly priced in downside risks from the stronger dollar, still-high inflation, and the higher cost of capital.Story continuesThe ugliness of the top and bottom lines could surprise investors, even when considering expectations have been marked lower.Consensus expects 3% year-over-year EPS growth for S&amp;P 500 companies, 13% sales growth, and 75 basis points of margin contraction to 11.8%, according to data crunched by Goldman Sachs. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to fall by 3% and margins to contract by 132 basis points.I expect investors to be reminded of this new economic normal (which mirrors stagflation) in earnings out later this week from banks Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.Executive toneIf you hate listening to earnings calls, suck it up and get on them this earnings season. The economy is downshifting and you need every clue possible on companies to survive.I think the tones on conference calls will be decidedly bearish. Two good points on this one from Goldman Sachs:""Topics for managements to discuss: (1) headwind to sales due to a stronger U.S. dollar, (2) headwind to margins due to elevated inflation and high inventories, (3) tax changes effective in 2023."" All bearish topics.""Early guidance from managements has demonstrated the various headwinds to corporate profitability. CEO confidence for the six months ahead fell to levels last seen in 1980. Earlier in September, FedEx pre-announced a large EPS miss and withdrew 2023 guidance. More recently, Micron guided revenue and EPS below consensus expectations, citing uncertain demand and growing inventory. In addition, more than 10% of S&amp;P 500 market cap has pre-announced earnings this quarter, consistent with prior periods of high uncertainty as companies manage investor expectations."" Expect other companies to act in a similar fashion to these early reporters.On a more upbeat note, Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance Live demand for Corona and Modelo remain strong.

75,f0e0f032-bd4e-38eb-bc98-2ab26df60a40,NKE,2022-10-10,"JPMorgan, Citigroup, FedEx, Nike and Micron are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-citigroup-fedex-nike-micron-083108628.html,1665390668,STORY,"['FDX', 'JPM', 'C', 'NKE', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 10, 2022 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, FedEx FDX, Nike NKE and Micron MU.Why Is the Market So Down on Big Bank Stocks?The big bank stocks have been laggards in the ongoing market pullback, though the Finance sector as a whole has held up relatively well on the back of strength in the insurance and regional bank spaces.It will be interesting to see if the group’s stock market fortunes will change in any way as JPMorgan and Citigroup kick-start the Q3 reporting cycle for the group on Friday, October 14th.JPMorgan shares are practically neck-to-neck with the Tech sector in the year-to-date period.The performance variance between JPMorgan and Citigroup this year, while not much, is nevertheless likely a function of the latter’s persistent earlier underperformance that Citigroup’s new management has been trying to account for through a strategic restructuring and repositioning.Bank Earnings ExpectationsWith respect to current earnings expectations for the group, Q3 earnings for the Zacks Finance sector are expected to be down -9.9% on +2.6% higher revenues. For the Zacks Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan and Citigroup are a part, Q3 earnings are expected to be roughly a fifth below the year-earlier level on +5.8% higher revenues.For JPMorgan, Q3 earnings are expected to be -25.3% below the year-earlier level on +8.5% higher revenues, while the same for Citigroup are currently expected to change -42.2% and +7.6% respectively on a year-over-year basis.The primary reason for the big year-over-year decline in Q3 earnings for the banks is the very high level of reserve releases in the year-earlier period.You would recall that the banks had booked significant reserves or provisions for loan losses as the pandemic took hold, which they subsequently released. Booking reserves is a direct hit to earnings and its subsequent release boosts profitability. This makes year-over-year comparisons somewhat misleading.Story continuesMost analysts look at bank profitability on a so-called ‘pre-provision’ basis, which strips out the impact of such reserves. If we look at bank profitability for 2022 Q3 on such a ‘pre-provision’ basis, they are essentially flat from the year-earlier level.If we look at a money-center bank like JPMorgan, we find that the commercial banking business is actually doing very well, with improved margins and modestly higher loan volumes offsetting weakness in the mortgage business and rising expenses. We know from Fed data that loan growth in the aggregate was up nicely in Q3, with credit card outlays particularly strong. In fact, other than home equity loans, all other loan categories should be up in the high single digits range in Q3.The positive revenue growth expected for JPM is reflective of the expected strong net interest income, a direct function of expanded margins and bigger loan volumes.On the capital markets side, the investment banking business is down significantly from the year-earlier level, perhaps by as much as -50%, with both M&amp;A and capital raising activities materially down.On the trading front, we are up against record volumes from the year-earlier level. But overall trading volumes, in the aggregate for the group as a whole, should essentially be flat from the year-earlier level. That said, there will be variations among the players, with some like JPMorgan modestly up from the year-earlier level, and others like Citi modestly down.Why the Downbeat Sentiment on Big Bank Stocks?Given the cyclical orientation of the banking business, they remain vulnerable to the rising recession risks to the economy as a result of the Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening. We see this heightened risk in the unusual behavior of the treasury bond yield curve, with shorter dated instruments that are more aligned Fed policy yielding above longer-dated bonds.I wouldn’t repeat why yield curve inversions are scary things and why it’s useful for all of us to keep a close eye on the risk of such a development. But I do want to point out here that I am sympathetic to the view that the current yield curve and its signaling power about future economic growth may not be fully comparable to historical periods as a result of the Fed’s extraordinary QE policies since the global financial crisis.Irrespective of this plausible but otherwise minority view of the yield inversion, they are a net negative for growth outlook. This, coupled with elevated oil prices and the geopolitical uncertainty resulting from the Ukraine war appear to be weighing on bank stocks lately.The market fears that JPMorgan and its peers will make a lot of money in the run up to the start of the recession as a result of higher margins, but all of that will get offset by the inevitable deterioration in loan portfolios as recessionary forces take hold. That happens through ‘provisions for loan losses’ that banks will eventually need to book as recession becomes unavoidable.The Covid recession turned out to be a non-event on the provisions front, as they ended up releasing the reserves that they had booked earlier. But that was because of the extraordinary fiscal support from the government.The typical behavior in a recession is for the booked provisions to eventually get charged off (or written off), with the magnitude of the charge-offs a function of how bad or otherwise the recession is. The 2008 episode was particularly nasty in this respect, given how central housing was to that downturn.The market has likely ‘over-learnt’ that lesson, as the banking group’s fundamentals remain rock solid at present, thanks in large part to the regulatory changes implemented in the wake of the 2008 recession. As such, we don’t see a lot of fundamental support for the excessively negative sentiment on big bank stocks at present, even if we assume a ‘typical’ recession on the horizon.We see the bank stocks as attractively positioned currently on valuation grounds as well. The group is currently trading at 46% of the S&amp;P 500 multiple, which compares to a 15-year high of 125%, low of 40% and median of 67%. Other valuation metrics validate this view as well.What to Expect from the Q3 Earnings Season after the Nike &amp; Micron ReportsWe have been skeptical of extrapolating from FedEx’s downbeat quarterly numbers as we see a big part of the FedEx problems as company specific. But FedEx is hardly alone in pointing towards a cloudier horizon.We don’t typically associate Nike with management and operational missteps, but we just heard them tell us of an inventory overhang that has negative implications for margins and profitability. Part of the +44% jump in Nike’s inventory is reportedly related to apparel whose movement through the company’s supply chain was affected by the logistical challenges.We don’t know the details, but it’s fair to assume that some part of the inventory buildup is related to softening demand. After all, the U.S. Fed’s ongoing tightening cycle is directed at crimping aggregate demand as a way to bring down inflationary pressures.Nike’s inventory problem validates what we heard from retailers in the Q2 reporting cycle. Chipmaker Micron is faced with a comparable issue that forced it to cut guidance and slash capex to bring chip supplies in alignment with market demand that has come down as a result of weakening PC, tablet and smartphone sales.We are starting to look at these early reports from FedEx, Nike, Micron and others for their fiscal periods ending in August as giving us a preview of what likely lies ahead as the banks kick-off the Q3 reporting cycle in about two weeks. For the record, we and other data vendors count these early reports as part of the Q3 earnings season.Q3 Earnings Season ScorecardThe aforementioned JPMorgan and Citigroup results won’t be the first quarterly reports for the Q3 earnings season. In fact, we have already seen 20 S&amp;P 500 members report results in recent days for their respective fiscal periods ending in August. We count all of these August-quarter results as part of our September-quarter tally.For the 20 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +1% from the same period last year on +12.6% higher revenues, with 70% beating EPS estimates and 55% beating revenue estimates.We are trying hard not to draw any conclusions here given how small the sample size of Q3 results is at this stage. But it’s hard to put a gloss on the fact that these 20 index members, some of whom are true bellwethers like FedEx and Nike, struggled to beat consensus estimates.In fact, you can see above that the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking the 5-year lows for this group of companies. Needless to add that it is hardly a reassuring start to the Q3 reporting cycle.The Earnings Big Picture2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +0.4% on +9% higher revenues.Don’t forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -6.2% from the same period last year.The +6.7% earnings growth expected for the index this year drops to +0.1% once the Energy sector’s contribution is excluded.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What Will Q3 Earnings Season Tell Wall Street?  Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

(NYSE:NKE) has seen better days. It has faced many setbacks recently, including delays in deliveries, higher shipment costs and factory lockdowns due to Covid-19. In response, the company has been investing more in its online presence and has restructured how it sells its products.Although Nike shares may have done well in the recent past, this year is different. The sports apparel company is facing a steep increase in inventories and diminished operating income. Investment banks are cutting their price targets on the company as it regroups.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKEOn the bright side, Nike has has great success with its digital sales in recent years. In particular, its digital sales skyrocketed during the pandemic as more and more people turned to online shopping. However, it has hit a snag recently due to inflation. Regardless, its digital sales platform is one of the most advanced in the industry and provides a great way for the company to reach its customers. Nike also has a strong brand and a loyal customer base.The near to medium-term outlook for Nike is stressed, though. Inflation is not going to go away anytime soon, while the U.S. Consumer Price Index jumped 8.3% during the year through August. Although the figure cooled from the preceding two months, it is still significant. With disposable incomes falling, Nike will find it difficult to sell its products.Nike is getting hit with the perfect stormNike is one of the world's most popular brands, and it has built its success on a foundation of innovation and marketing excellence. In recent years, the company has been forced to change course in the face of increased competition from online retailers. Digital sales have been a major priority for Nike, and its efforts have clearly paid off.The company's robust e-commerce platform helped it offset some of the lost sales from its brick-and-mortar stores. Nike's strong performance during the pandemic is a testament to its to adapt to changing market conditions.Story continuesNike has been adjusting its priorities to focus on selling directly to consumers. The move allows it to sell more products than ever, as nearly half of all sales are made through digital platforms. It also offers apps that let customers keep track of its new products and order items while also helping people stay healthy. This means there is potential for more business and online sales in the years ahead.However, it is now working to overcome the effects of inflation and other headwinds.In September, Nike reported that its revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were up 4% at $12.7 billion. The company's direct sales grew 8% to $5.1 billion, while digital sales recorded an impressive hike of 16% on a reported basis. Due to lockdowns, China experienced a 16% decrease in sales from the previous quarter.Nike's earnings per share declined by 20% to 93 cents from the previous quarter. The gross margin saw a 2.2% decrease due to logistical and freight costs and markdowns in its direct sales business. The margin decrease was mainly due to the North American region, where Nike sold excessive inventory at significant discounts.The company has $9.66 billion worth of inventory, which is a 44% increase from the previous year. Supply chain issues made for higher inventory levels for Nike, but that was partially offset by increased demand in North America and the low rates of its foreign counterparts.Logistics have been a major issue in recent years, with the pandemic being the most notable example. This and other delays caused bottlenecks for all businesses. Besides the delayed deliveries, the freight cost over the last couple of years has skyrocketed. It seems like the bottlenecks are finally easing now, though.A sluggish holiday season is raising alarm bellsEarly warning signs indicate we will see sluggish holiday sales in the retail sector. Ocean shipping logistics managers told CNBC they are seeing significant consumer pullback currently.They have also noticed a decrease in ocean freight orders for September and October across many products, from machinery to housing.The recent developments in the retail industry are no surprise to those paying attention. For months, retailers have been ordering more inventory than last year to avoid the ""empty shelves"" phenomenon that occurred during the pandemic.However, this has led to many retailers having excess inventory on hand. This will likely lead to even more discounting and clearance sales in the coming weeks as they try to get rid of their excess stock before it becomes obsolete. Nike will likely also suffer a similar fate.TakeawayNike is a reliable stock that has done well in most circumstances. However, the recent build-up in inventory is cause for concern.It is a red flag for investors, indicating the company may have difficulty moving its products. The build-up in inventory will eventually lead to markdowns and discounts, which will eat into Nike's profits. Under these circumstances, the stock will remain under pressure this year.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

SubscribeMonday, October 10, 2022Today's newsletter is by Brian Sozzi, an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.The money you have invested in the stock market is at big risk of being further vaporized in the remaining weeks of October. Full stop.That's not a scare tactic so you share this newsletter with five friends. It's just the assessment of one person who has been doing this close to 20 years now. I think investors took too many hits on the ""hopium pipe"" (thanks RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas for this new fin-term for my vast arsenal) during the two-day, rip-your-face off rally to start the fourth quarter.Now, it's reality check time again as the high wears off.Here are a few risks barreling toward you...Inflation dataThis week, inflation data in the form of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), and price expectations from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are coming out. The CPI report is arguably the most important at the moment as investors look for signs that inflation is cooling at the hands of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes.The problem is that the CPI report isn't expected to slow much on a month-to- month basis. ""Core inflation continues to wield significant momentum,"" Wells Fargo Economist Sarah House pointed out in a client note.In turn, that sets the table for a harsh market reaction like what we saw on Friday to a too-hot September jobs report.Raw earnings numbersWarnings in recent weeks from AMD, Micron, Nike, FedEx highlight how crappy this earnings season will be. The negative reactions to those warnings underscore how the market hasn't truly priced in downside risks from the stronger dollar, still-high inflation, and the higher cost of capital.Story continuesThe ugliness of the top and bottom lines could surprise investors, even when considering expectations have been marked lower.Consensus expects 3% year-over-year EPS growth for S&amp;P 500 companies, 13% sales growth, and 75 basis points of margin contraction to 11.8%, according to data crunched by Goldman Sachs. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to fall by 3% and margins to contract by 132 basis points.I expect investors to be reminded of this new economic normal (which mirrors stagflation) in earnings out later this week from banks Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.Executive toneIf you hate listening to earnings calls, suck it up and get on them this earnings season. The economy is downshifting and you need every clue possible on companies to survive.I think the tones on conference calls will be decidedly bearish. Two good points on this one from Goldman Sachs:""Topics for managements to discuss: (1) headwind to sales due to a stronger U.S. dollar, (2) headwind to margins due to elevated inflation and high inventories, (3) tax changes effective in 2023."" All bearish topics.""Early guidance from managements has demonstrated the various headwinds to corporate profitability. CEO confidence for the six months ahead fell to levels last seen in 1980. Earlier in September, FedEx pre-announced a large EPS miss and withdrew 2023 guidance. More recently, Micron guided revenue and EPS below consensus expectations, citing uncertain demand and growing inventory. In addition, more than 10% of S&amp;P 500 market cap has pre-announced earnings this quarter, consistent with prior periods of high uncertainty as companies manage investor expectations."" Expect other companies to act in a similar fashion to these early reporters.On a more upbeat note, Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance Live demand for Corona and Modelo remain strong.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 28% in the last quarter. But that's small comfort given the dismal price performance over the last year. Like a receding glacier in a warming world, the share price has melted 65% in that period. The share price recovery is not so impressive when you consider the fall. You could argue that the sell-off was too severe.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last year, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. View our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unfortunately PayPal Holdings reported an EPS drop of 58% for the last year. This proportional reduction in earnings per share isn't far from the 65% decrease in the share price. Therefore one could posit that the market has not become more concerned about the company, despite the lower EPS. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on PayPal Holdings' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that PayPal Holdings shareholders are down 65% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PayPal Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for PayPal Holdings  you should be aware of.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines International Business Machines Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Del Bene, for US$222k worth of shares, at about US$139 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$119. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Robert Del Bene.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$135k for 1.08k shares. But they sold 1.60k shares for US$222k. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like International Business Machines better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At International Business Machines Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, International Business Machines insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Specifically, Independent Director David Farr bought US$125k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. International Business Machines insiders own about US$85m worth of shares. That equates to 0.08% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At International Business Machines Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The more recent transactions are a positive, but International Business Machines insiders haven't shown the sustained enthusiasm that we look for, although they do own a decent number of shares, overall. So they seem pretty well aligned, overall. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in International Business Machines.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

And dividend investors don’t often think about tech stocks. However, there are undervalued tech stocks with dividends that are worth focusing on.In fact, there are a handful of tech stocks with low valuations and attractive dividends. Of course, not all tech stocks with nice dividends are worth buying, but a handful of them certainly are.As investors continue to fish for a low in the stock market, many of these stocks are worth buying on pullbacks by the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegardless of what the Fed is doing or how stocks are trading, businesses in the U.S. remain relatively healthy. Although the demand for their  products and services is easing somewhat, they are generally holding up well.Let’s look at several tech stocks with dividends right now.TickerCompanyCurrent PriceAVGOBroadcom$448IBMInternational Business Machines$135INTCIntel$27.80HPEHewlett Packard Enterprise$13.80CSCOCisco Systems$43.65Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comChip stocks have had a hard time recently, as this group has been pulverized in 2022. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a name worth considering.At its current prices, Broadcom offers a unique combination of stability, value and yield.Analysts, on average, expect AVGO to deliver 21% revenue growth this year and 6% growth next year. That’s alongside average forecasts calling for 34% and 8% earnings growth this year and next year, respectively.Broadcom is trading at an attractive 12 times this year’s earning. While it’s possible that analysts’ mean forecasts won’t prove accurate, the fact that analysts are upbeat on AVGO is positive.Add in the stock’s 3.5% dividend yield, and  AVGO is poised to succeed. If AVGO stock revisits the low $400s, it will be hard to ignore.Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: International Business Machines (IBM)The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.Source: Twin Design / Shutterstock.comStory continuesSo many investors are obsessed with tech stocks, but most of them overlook the dinosaurs of the sector. One such dinosaur is International Business Machines (NASDAQ:IBM).No one seems to give this stock any love, yet they are ignoring the obvious: IBM has been a relative strength leader!Given that fact, it may be an under-the-radar find for some investors.Analysts, on average, expect 5% revenue growth from IBM this year alongside 15% earnings growth. That’s very high for IBM, as those who have followed this stock for the last decade know. As for next year, analysts expect about 6% earnings growth on sub-1% revenue growth.At current prices, investors are paying about 15 times earnings and collecting a 4.8% dividend yield. When I last looked at IBM stock about a month ago, it had a lower valuation and a higher yield, but the stock has rallied more than 13% since thenFor the year, the shares are now up about  1% versus the Nasdaq’s 33% decline. Over the last 12 months, IBM is up 11.5% while the Nasdaq is down 35%.How’s that for outperformance?Undervalued Tech Stocks With Dividends: Intel (INTC)intel stockSource: canon_shooter / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has  been around forever and will likely remain around forever. However, its longevity can’t mask reality, which is rather bleak for the chipmaker at the moment.Intel is not growing, as shown by its 15.5% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3. The sharp drop of global PC sales, identified by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). may continue.Analysts’ estimates of Intel’s revenue growth could be better, but it has a 5.2% dividend yield and a healthy payout ratio. It recently raised more cash via the Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) IPO, while INTC still holds some MBLY stock, and INTC will benefit if MBLY rises further.All that said, I would love to see Intel fall below $25 before buying it. After the shares’ recent rally, their valuation is no longer as attractive as it once was. Plus, as we’re hearing from other semiconductor and chip companies, the sector is not doing well.But Intel will survive the test of time.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockPCs may be a problem, but not for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE). This company, is focused on “a cloud operating experience, built-in security, and optimized performance for your workloads to drive your business forward.”That puts it in a different position than HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and leaves it in a well-suited to focus on other areas of tech. Unfortunately however,, growing has not been easy for HPE.Analysts expect mild revenue and profit growth this year and next year, but on the plus side, their average estimates do call for top-and bottom-line gains. Further, the shares trade at a meager seven times earnings.Consequently, HPE stock, which pays a 3.5% dividend yield, may be worth watching.Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comFinally, we have Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). While it was a darling of investors during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago, that has not been the case in recent years. Cisco has performed okay, but it has been anything but a runaway train.However, Cisco may be worth an extra look amid the current downtrend.Worth noting is that the stock trades at just 12.5 times this year’s earnings estimates and pays a 3.4% dividend yield. Cisco is not the most exciting name on this list, but its dependability and low valuation are worth focusing on.On average, analysts expect 5% earnings and revenue growth from CSCO this year. However, in 2023, analysts’ mean outlook call for 7% earnings growth on and just 4% revenue growth. If CSCO can deliver that type of mid-level growth alongside a solid yield, then we may see the stock push higher over time.A decline of the shares below $40 would have my attention even more.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But the company, whose brands include Audi, Bentley, Porsche and Lamborghini, is pushing just as aggressively into electric vehicles as either General Motors (NYSE:GM) or Ford (NYSE:F). In fact, Volkswagen has announced that it will spend a massive $180 billion to ensure that 25% of all the vehicles its sells globally are electric by 2026.

By 2030, EVs are expected to comprise 50% of Ford’s total sales.

And while competitors such as Volkswagen and Ford are hot on its heels, Tesla continues to retain a commanding lead over all other automakers when it comes to the manufacturing and sale of EVs. The company’s total electric-vehicle production for the recently completed third quarter amounted to 365,000, which was far ahead of any other automaker.For all of last year, Tesla produced just shy of one million (930,422) electric vehicles, a new record for the company. This year, Tesla is on track to make more than 1.5 million EVs.Tesla is increasingly a global company, having opened a new manufacturing facility outside Berlin, Germany this year and expanded its existing manufacturing hub in Shanghai, China.And the company continues to refine and improve the batteries its vehicles use as it drives towards CEO Elon Musk’s goal of selling 20 million Tesla EVs a year by 2030. If there’s one potential pitfall for Tesla, it is distraction. Whether it be Musk’s public battle over Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or the company’s foray into humanoid robots, Tesla is often managing things other than EVs. If the company can keep its eyes on the road ahead, though, it should be just fine.TSLA stock is down 35% this year and trading at $230 per share.

(NYSE:PNC) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-pnc-financial-services-123017248.html,1665318617,STORY,['PNC'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase PNC Financial Services Group's shares on or after the 14th of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of November.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.50 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.00 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that PNC Financial Services Group has a trailing yield of 4.0% on the current share price of $151.34. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see PNC Financial Services Group paying out a modest 41% of its earnings.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, PNC Financial Services Group's earnings per share have been growing at 12% a year for the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. PNC Financial Services Group has delivered 16% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs PNC Financial Services Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating PNC Financial Services Group more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks PNC Financial Services Group is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for PNC Financial Services Group you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:ADI) institutional owners after losing 12% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-analog-110011388.html,1665399611,STORY,['ADI'],"[If you want to know who really controls Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 4.0% increase in share prices after a year of 12% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Analog Devices, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Analog Devices already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Analog Devices' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Analog Devices is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.8% and 3.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Analog Devices, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$252m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Analog Devices. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Analog Devices .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:PAYC) is an American software company that provides HR payroll software and data analytics among other software products. The company is cash-rich and invests in itself. On August 15, Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) announced that it is increasing and extending its share repurchase program of $550 million by $1.1 billion. The new share repurchase program brings its existing authorization to $1.65 billion, which the company expects to complete by August 15, 2024. The company has free cash flows of $210.69 million.Wall Street is bullish on Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC). This August, KeyBanc analyst Jason Celino raised his price target on Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) to $432 from $390 and reiterated a buy-side Overweight rating on the shares. On September 1, Citi analyst Steven Enders started coverage of Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) with a Buy rating and a $457 price target. Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) is ranked among the top holdings of Motley Fool Asset Management and is among the best Motley Fool stocks to buy now.At the end of Q2 2022, 43 hedge funds were long Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) and held stakes worth $1.20 billion in the company. Of those, $17 million were of Motley Fool Asset Management Company. The investment covers 1.61% of the fund's 13F portfolio.Here is what Kerrisdale Capital had to say about Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) in its July 2022 investor letter:“We are short shares of Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC), a $19 billion SaaS-based payroll services company that has been one of the best performing large capitalization software stocks since it went public in 2014. Even after the market turmoil of this year, Paycom trades at more than 70x the consensus estimate for this year’s free cash flow, a testament to the fact that, while unprofitable tech companies and temporary pandemic winners have been justly punished in the markets, there’s still plenty of froth left in allegedly higher quality fare. Paycom’s valuation, in particular, doesn’t come close to reflecting the near term headwinds of slowing employment growth, meaningful TAM saturation, and increasing competitive intensity.Paycom’s steady and robust growth over the past decade has come by way of taking market share from payroll industry behemoths ADP and Paychex. Paycom has been accompanied in this quest by high-tech peers Paylocity (PCTY) and closely held BambooHR, and has been buttressed by secular job growth trends in the US small and medium business sector. But Paycom is no longer a $100 million annual revenue upstart, and neither are its peers. At $1.4 billion of run-rate recurring revenue, the company is a scaled business, and combined with Paylocity, Bamboo, and other dynamic tech companies in the sector, the group’s share of the SME payroll market is north of 40%. That’s a lot more than the blue-sky implications of Paycom’s 5% market share claim, and it means that further market share gains will be a lot more difficult going forward.At the same time, ADP is fighting back, increasing its customer retention rate and growing its employee rolls. Rippling and Gusto, two rapidly growing startups in the space, have also recently raised capital at $10-billion-plus valuations, and are actively fighting for market share. All this means that the competition faced by Paycom is about to get a lot tougher. If that weren’t enough, US employment growth looks to be decelerating at a fairly significant clip, which means that all the payroll players will be fighting in a smaller field. For a SaaS company with an astronomical valuation like Paycom’s, price cutting is probably not something investors are accustomed to thinking about, but they might soon have to…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

Despite positive fundamental momentum—the company recently reported 30% revenue growth and 28% trailing twelve months FCF margins—shares traded lower during Q2 as investors rotated out of high-growth stocks with elevated multiples. The company’s highly efficient sales and marketing capability, combined with substantial R&amp;D investment, points to sustained long-term revenue and FCF growth. Meanwhile, we recognize a recession would likely have an impact on Atlassian via slowing growth metrics. However, we believe its low priced, mission critical cloud tools would prove relatively resilient in this scenario. For these reasons and shares trading at a very attractive valuation for a business with highly recurring revenues, strong revenue growth prospects and attractive margins, we added to our position.”8.

Axon claims that with usage of body cameras, complaints against police departments are down 88% and use of force is down 58%. We believe the company is a premier part of the solution to prevent bad actors in law enforcement and the mistrust that has resulted from those bad actors.The company has three major product lines: first, high-definition cameras (sensor division) worn on the body or mounted on vehicles (newer products incorporate live streaming and automated license plate readers); second, subscription-based digital evidence software (evidence.com) that stores body camera and third-party video allowing for evidentiary chain of custody, search, and report writing (officer court time reduced by 70%); and third, non-lethal TASER devices (that can temporarily incapacitate dangerous and violent actors using an electrical shock) that save lives by avoiding discharging firearms (the company claims 258,000 lives have been saved so far). When used in combination, its cameras provide GPS officer location and live streaming, while its software can provide real-time operations mapping of active situations. In the future, Axon seeks to add consumer safety products (launching in 2022) that will automatically notify 911 if deployed, drone-based camera products, more VR training, and additional cloud-based software, including evidence software usable by prosecutors and defense attorneys, which could be a $1 billion market on its own.From a financial perspective, the company is really built upon recurring revenue – it is not a one-time device sales company. Software made up 28.5% of 2021 revenues. And while hardware made up 43% of 2021 sales, about two-thirds of that is now bundled under long-term deals, so really only about 15% of the company’s total revenue is one time in nature. The remaining 27% of sales is warranty and cartridge consumables, which are largely recurring as well. As software grows as a proportion of revenue (to what we believe will be over 40% by 2026), margins should expand. We believe that EBITDA margins can expand from 20% in 2021 to nearly 30% by 2026. Revenue growth, which was nearly 27% in 2021, should continue at over 20%, given that the company is less than 2% penetrated into its $52 billion addressable market. Finally, the company has over $400 million of cash and no debt on its balance sheet. When combined with its significant free cash flow (about 75% of EBITDA converts to free cash flow), Axon has significant capital to grow its business, complete accretive acquisitions, and potentially return capital to shareholders.”6.

(NYSE:V) stock rose 3.5% last week, insiders who sold US$637k worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$223, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Visa Visa Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, James Hoffmeister, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$402k worth of shares at a price of US$231 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$184. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Visa didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of VisaAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Visa insiders own about US$190m worth of shares (which is 0.05% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Visa Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Visa shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Visa insiders selling. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for Visa.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

97,ee48c43f-f3af-327a-9b86-aa0c1af044a7,V,2022-10-10,Tech Earnings Matter More Than Ever as the Bubble Deflates,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-earnings-matter-more-ever-101957671.html,1665397197,STORY,['V'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Investors in technology companies are focused more than ever on profits, following an era when low interest rates drove a speculative frenzy in money-losing companies.Unprofitable companies have underperformed this year and are likely to continue doing so, investors say. A slowing economy and the threat of recession make their stocks a riskier bet than usual, suggesting that the unwinding from the peak of pandemic-era speculation may not yet be done.A basket of money-losing tech companies compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has plunged 57% in 2022, including a drop of 0.3% on Monday. To compare, an exchange-traded fund focused on dividend-paying companies in the industry has fallen 22% on a total-return basis, and the Nasdaq 100 Index has dropped 32%.The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.1% on Monday.The drop has come as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises rates to fight inflation, a headwind to stocks that are priced on their prospects far out in the future. Goldman’s basket sank 6.7% on Friday, after a strong jobs report underlined that the Fed is likely to remain hawkish. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has jumped to almost 3.9%, more than double where it started the year.“Profitability has become much more important,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “There may come a time where unprofitable companies outperform again, but I don’t think Fed policy or the market backdrop will favor them anytime soon. I think they’re in for more pain until we see inflation moderate and the Fed slows its pace of hikes.”He favors companies with stable businesses and high visibility into profit streams, including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and Nvidia Corp.The focus on profitability represents a sharp about-face from pandemic-era trends, when ultra-low rates and economic stimulus fueled outperformance in hyper-growth stocks. Goldman’s basket soared more than 400% between a low in March 2020 and a peak hit less than a year later. It has since dropped 73% from the high.Story continuesAmong the unprofitable companies with the biggest stock declines this year are Unity Software Inc., Okta Inc. and Asana Inc., all down 68% or more.While the selloff has compressed price-earnings multiples, many unprofitable tech companies -- notably high-growth software stocks -- continue to trade at sky-high valuations. According to KeyBanc Capital Markets, software valuations remain above average in terms of enterprise value to free cash flow.In another risk, many unprofitable companies offer stock-based compensation packages to employees. This has become a headwind amid the market’s decline, as companies either have to issue more shares to keep talent, which dilutes the stakes of other investors, or they have to pay more in cash, a further drag on the bottom line.“There’s been a complete 180 in the market backdrop compared to 2020, with rates going up and the economy slowing,” said Patrick Burton, a portfolio manager at Winslow Capital Management, which oversees about $26 billion. “Not only has the cost of capital skyrocketed and the math stopped working for stock compensation, but these companies should see slower growth. That makes us think they have more room to drop.”Burton favors tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc., and said some chipmakers had become attractive given their year-to-date weakness.“We wouldn’t branch out into unprofitable tech,” he said. “Eventually, high-growth unprofitable stocks will come back, but we don’t expect that for a long time.”Tech Chart of the DayThe collapse in Meta Platforms Inc.’s stock shows no sign of stopping. The Facebook parent closed Friday at its lowest since January 2019, extending a slump that has erased 60% -- and about $577 billion -- off its market value this year. Last week’s drop of 1.6% represented its fourth straight negative week, and it stood in contrast to the gains posted by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Alphabet, as well as social-media peers Pinterest Inc., Snap Inc., and Twitter Inc.Top Tech StoriesThe Biden administration’s new restrictions on technology exports to China could undercut the country’s ability to develop wide swaths of its economy, from semiconductors and supercomputers to surveillance systems and advanced weapons.Chinese semiconductor stocks slumped after fresh US curbs on China’s access to American technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season, stoking concerns that the industry’s downturn is far from over.US restrictions on China’s access to advanced American technologies could slash growth of the country’s largest chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., by half next year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.Twitter Inc. has restricted and locked the account of billionaire musician and fashion designer Kanye West, just one day after he returned to the social media platform for the first time in almost two years. Twitter said the account was locked due to a violation of its policies.Chinese food delivery titan Meituan is studying an expansion into Hong Kong and international markets as domestic growth slows, according to people familiar with the matter.Japanese printer maker Seiko Epson Corp. may raise prices in response to the chronic supply chain upheaval that’s disrupted electronics firms around the world.Noom Inc., the maker of a controversial weight loss app, is looking for a new chief executive officer to replace co-founder and CEO Saeju Jeong.Electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. will recall about 13,000 vehicles -- nearly all of vehicles delivered to customers -- after discovering a minor structural defect.(Updates to market open.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"
98,40b503d1-c4e0-3147-a81e-ab1ea2cecd1d,V,2022-10-10,7 Stocks for Beginners to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-beginners-buy-now-105502929.html,1665140102,STORY,"['DIS', 'ENI.MI', 'BP', 'KO', 'V']","[It’s never too early to begin investing. The earlier a person begins investing, the more time their money has to compound and the greater their returns are likely to be. Every reader has likely heard a similar sentiment. It’s difficult to paint a picture of the average stock investor. Statistics say that 39% of 18-29-year-olds own stocks. That is the lowest percentage of any age group. Nearly six in ten of Americans 65 and older own stocks. Their portfolios have an average value of $109,000 while the average portfolio of those under 35 is worth $7,360. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBeginner investors should buy time-tested stocks. That means they should skew toward blue-chip firms and let the power of compounding do its magic. Although they have more time until they retire and thus a greater ability to absorb risk, slow and steady will win the race for them.AAPLApple$139GOOG,GOOGLAlphabet$83.50VVisa$195QQQInvesco QQQ Trust Series$261COSTCostco$487JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$171MELIMercadoLibre$871 Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done it again, to no one’s surprise. Its stock has risen on news of yet another quarterly record revenue . While competitors’ sales languish as consumer spending slows and recession fears ramp up, Apple continues to post impressive results. The world’s most valuable firm by market capitalization generated a record $90.1 billion of revenue last quarter. Apple’s iPhones accounted for $42.6 billion of that $90.1 billion of revenues, as iPhone revenue jumped nearly 10% year-over-year. So Apple continues to be the strongest of the tech giants as others falter. AAPL stock is an excellent choice for beginner investors because of its tremendous stability in an otherwise volatile tech sector. Further, it provides a dividend of 23 cents that management continues to grow. AAPL stock currently has a dividend yield of 0.54%. That is relatively low. However, the company has increased its dividend by an annual average of 9.5% over the past five years. Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is among the faltering tech giants mentioned in the paragraph above. So it’s somewhat curious that  I’m recommending it at this point. And unlike Apple, Alphabet did not report strong Q3 results at all. Google’s bread and butter is advertising revenues from its search engine, YouTube ad revenue, and its cloud business. Alphabet reported its earnings last week on Oct. 25. And its ad revenues were very problematic, rising only 2.5% YOY. Analysts, on average, expected the company to report $56.9 billion of ad revenue, so the $54.48 billion of ad sales that it actually reported was disappointing. YouTube’s ad revenues reached $7.07 billion, well below the $7.5 billion that analysts had anticipated. None of this seems to suggest that GOOG stock is a buy. However, there is a silver lining. Google’s search ads are expected to fare better during the continued economic downturn than direct response and display ads. So the shares may not perform well in the short term, but they should outperform the stocks of other ad giants. A beginner investor who buys GOOG now will get an inexpensive stock which is extremely likely to rebound over time and provide strong returns. Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) stock has short-term and long-term positive catalysts that make it a smart investment for beginner investors. In the short term, it’s clear that credit card spending remains strong. Total credit card balances hit $916 billion in September. That’s a level not seen since before the pandemic. The data point indicates that Americans are spending and borrowing despite increasing fears of recession. Whatever the case, Visa is among the credit card companies that stand to benefit as credit card balances are currently 23% higher than their pandemic low. while its defaults remain below pre-pandemic levels. Beginner investors should also understand that Visa is an excellent long-term choice. Its annual return over the past decade has averaged 19%. Visa stock also  a dividend which yields a modest 0.69%. However, its dividend has grown at an average annual rate of 17.4% over the past five years. Invesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ)Tiles that say ETF on top of stacks of coins on a blue backgroundSource: kenary820 / ShutterstockBeginner investors should buy Invesco QQQ Trust Series (NASDAQ:QQQ) stock. In fact, they would be wise to consider any number of ETFs that are tailored to their individual interests and own stocks in sectors in which they believe strongly. Generally speaking, ETFs provide trading flexibility, diversification, lower costs, and tax benefits, compared to mutual funds. Beginner investors should consider QQQ stock because it provides the benefits listed above. Further, because QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index. the ETF also provides exposure to the tech-heavy Nasdaq. As a result, investors will get exposure to the best tech stocks, including Apple, Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). A beginner investor who owns QQQ will learn, among other things, about interest rates and their effects on the tech sector.  The price of QQQ is low now but will rise in time when the Fed ultimately slows its quantitative tightening process. So the long-term outlook of QQQ is bright. Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comIt’s reasonable to argue that buying Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock now isn’t a great idea. The bulk wholesaler has received a lot of attention as  worries about inflation  have risen in 2022. Consumers are looking for ways to ease the burden of inflation. And bulk buying is an obvious means of doing so. So it’s no surprise that investors have flocked to COST stock, causing it to rise. That has left many pundits arguing that Costco stock is overpriced. They have a reasonable argument because Costco’s P/E ratio of 38.7 is higher than that of 84% of defensive-retail stocks. But there are many equally reasonable arguments against the idea that Costco is overpriced. For example, its return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital are all better than 90% of those of other companies in the defensive-retail sector. That suggests Costco is fairly priced. It’s a great stock and is likely to continue rising as the economy worsens on rising 2023 recession fears. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comBeginner investors should consider a strong healthcare stock like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Healthcare stocks tend to do well during recessions, making JNJ a good choice now. Further, Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently particularly well-positioned. The company is flush with cash after raking in loads of money from the sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and other products. It has approximately $34 billion of cash on hand. That gives JNJ the ability to buy other pharma companies whose valuations have dropped sharplyBut Johnson &amp; Johnson is not jumping to make acquisitions. It remains focused on the  spin off of its consumer business, Kenvue, which is slated to occur next year. JNJ can afford to wait before making acquisitions because a recession appears more and more likely to occur next year. JNJ stock has every chance to rise, management will keep the company stable at worst, and investors will get dividends in the meantime. So there’s a lot to like about JNJ. MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has been described as the Amazon of Latin America. MELI is an eCommerce platform based in Uruguay with operations that span Mexico, Central America, and all of South America. Amazon was founded in 1994 and MercadoLibre was launched in 1999. So the two aren’t very different in age. However, MercadoLibre might be able to grow more rapidly going forward. And its shares have provided massive annual average returns of 26.14% over the past ten years. Amazon, on the other hand, has provided slightly lower average annual returns of 25.84%.MELI stock is deeply undervalued, according to most Wall Street analysts. More than 20 analysts currently cover MercadoLibre. The vast majority of them rate the shares a “buy.” Their average price target on the shares is $870. The company is growing at breakneck  speed, as its annual average EBITDA growth over the last three years is 154%, and its revenue that has grown by an average of 64% annually in the same period. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. In fact, the share price is up a full 160% compared to three years ago. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, NVIDIA achieved compound earnings per share growth of 40% per year. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 37% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how NVIDIA has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on NVIDIA's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that NVIDIA shareholders are down 42% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 20%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.Story continuesWe will like NVIDIA better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

That alone will help drive $600 million in advertising sales in 2023 for the segment. Anmuth expects those numbers to swell by 2026 as Netflix's execution on selling ads improves.By 2026, Anmuth thinks Netflix's US/Canada segment will boast 22 million subscribers and drive $2.65 billion in advertising sales.Optimism on Wall Street regarding the financial impact of Netflix's looming ad-tier has greatly supported the stock in recent months. Shares of the streaming giant are up 19% in the past three months, out-performing the S&amp;P 500's 4% drop.""Given Netflix's recently muted sub growth, advertising is critical to re-accelerating revenue, expanding Netflix's SAM [subscription addressable market], and driving greater profitability,"" explained Anmuth.""The Netflix narrative has shifted from slow/no sub growth on the current business to advertising and paid sharing coming in 2023.""To Anmuth's point, the first half of 2022 has been un-Netflix like — factors that have led to the stock plunging 63% year to date.The company shed more than one million paid subscribers in the first two quarters of the year as the economy slowed and consumers cutback. Becoming more mobile post COVID-19 pandemic has also weighed on subscriber trends for Netflix, as has been the rising of competing streaming platforms from Disney and Paramount.But there is a real chance for Netflix to make a meaningful business by offering an ad-supported pricing tier for consumers, Cowen analyst John Blackledge says.

If you want to see some more of the best fundamental stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy.A good fundamentals stock is a stock of a company that's profitable and that has durable competitive advantages to maintain its profitability over time and to grow. Ideally that company would also be well run and have substantial growth opportunities in its future. That company would have scale and a strong history of earnings.Furthermore the best fundamental stocks would also include those aforementioned companies that also trade for a potential discount to their long term value. In terms of metrics, indicators such as a strong history of profits and history of returning profits back to shareholders is important. A history of dividends can also help.Currently, the market is facing several headwinds including rising interest rates and also a potentially slowing economy. Despite the economy potentially slowing, inflation is still a problem as well.Due to all the headwinds, the market has declined substantially with even many of the leading high quality stocks down over 20%+ year to date. In terms of the major indexes, the NASDAQ is down around 32%, the S&amp;P 500 is down around 23.6% and the Dow Jones is down around 19.3%.While the market could decline further given geopolitical events or if the economic data fails to meet expectations, there is also potential opportunity for long term investors to buy quality stocks.In the long term, quality companies with strong fundamentals could increase their earnings over time and potentially be worth more in times when the market is more bullish in terms of valuations on earnings.Given the market decline, the stocks of many quality companies are on sale, and there are several companies that could potentially fit in the list of the 10 best fundamentals stocks to buy.Where to Invest?Copyright: hin255 / 123RF Stock PhotoStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy, we used subjective measures to pick 10 stocks that have a strong history of quality earnings that also trade for reasonable valuations.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database who held shares in the stocks at the end of Q2.10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy10.

Its media business has a rich library of intellectual property, which provides a powerful engine for creating new content across the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands. This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade prior to the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.”Stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are also among the best fundamental stocks to buy.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British CompaniesMost Valuable Companies in HistoryTop 10 High Dividend Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

106,f4538c2c-a3b2-3688-8b0c-861eb4ba0f1b,ORCL,2022-10-10,Chinese Crypto Mogul Li Sells Stake in Exchange Firm Huobi,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-crypto-mogul-li-sells-091556230.html,1665220556,STORY,['ORCL'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Huobi Global said controlling shareholder Leon Li sold his entire stake in the cryptocurrency exchange operator and will cease to be involved in its operations.Li sold his holding in Huobi to a buyout firm managed by About Capital Management (HK)Co., the company said in an emailed statement. The co-founder will no longer be involved in any aspect of Huobi Global’s business, according to a Huobi spokesperson. Bloomberg reported the intended sale in August.Once the most active Bitcoin trading platform on the globe, Huobi has in recent years retreated from China, its biggest user base and revenue source at one time. Li’s exchange stopped providing services to Chinese users after Beijing declared crypto transactions illegal last year.The bourse has since accelerated its expansion into overseas markets including Turkey and Brazil, but is fighting bigger rivals such as Binance and FTX. As of Saturday, it was ranked eighth in 24-hour volume among exchanges with a top “trust score” of 10 for the legitimacy of its data, according to tracker CoinGecko.“Following Huobi’s exit from the Chinese mainland market in 2021, we have accelerated our globalization push amidst a challenging market environment, which adds to the impetus for Huobi to seek a new shareholding structure with a global vision and international resources,” Li said in the statement.The transaction has no impact on Huobi’s core operations and business management teams, the company said.After the transaction, Huobi Global will enact a series of initiatives including the injection of sufficient capital in margin and risk provision funds, as well as measures to further enhance competitiveness and compliance procedures, a spokesperson said.“We believe the virtual asset industry is still in its early stage and there is tremendous upside for long term growth,” said Ted Chen, chief executive officer of About Capital, in the statement. Chen founded About in 2008 and previously was a founding partner of China investment manager Greenwoods Asset Management. “We are confident that the holistic approach to rebuild Huobi Global as the premier international virtual asset exchange would solidify both the recognition and trust of Huobi’s international users.”Story continuesHuobi was co-founded in 2013 by former Oracle Corp. coder Li, who quickly transformed the Beijing startup into the world’s most active Bitcoin exchange by charging zero transaction fees. In 2017, Chinese regulators told local exchanges to stop hosting trades between fiat and digital money, the first of a stream of pronouncements that quelled a perceived threat to the country’s financial stability.Li had at different times ceded daily management as he dealt with health issues. The current chief executive officer is Hua Zhu, an ex-Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. technologist who joined Huobi in 2020.In an interview for a 2020 Bloomberg News report, Li said he had never received any official notice barring him from leaving China but he’s chosen not to, unsure of the risks that would entail.(Updates with rank in fourth paragraph, and Huobi comment and Chen quote.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"
107,ac155be0-25e2-33eb-8c54-7e20a533eb02,ORCL,2022-10-10,7 Tech Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-tech-stocks-too-cheap-191630821.html,1665083790,STORY,"['ADBE', 'NXPI', 'MSFT', 'GLW', 'ORCL', 'PCRFY', 'PYPL']","[With the ugliness in the equities sector, astute investors may want to shift their focus to cheap tech stocks. Granted, among the major indices, the technology-centric Nasdaq Composite suffered the most thus far. On a year-to-date basis, it’s down nearly 30%. However, it also opens the door to significant discounts for patient market participants.That’s one angle. The other is that tech-driven companies offer some of the most groundbreaking innovations. Again, it’s not to take away from the pain. Certainly, the red ink hurts and I refuse to diminish investors’ frustration. At the same time, acquiring cheap tech stocks now can build a foundation for future growth.Of course, there are cheap tech stocks and then there are securities too cheap to touch. To help filter out the wheat from the chaff, I enlisted the help of Gurufocus.com. Narrowing down to compelling ideas that genuinely showcase undervalued businesses – as opposed to possible value traps – this investment resource is unparalleled in its utility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that, here are cheap teach stocks that astute buyers should consider.MSFTMicrosoft$247.29NXPINXP Semiconductors$159.91ORCLOracle$65.33GLWCorning$31.40PCRFYPanasonic$7.35PYPLPayPal$94.37ADBEAdobe$298.64Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comCheap tech stock, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) suits myriad content angles. Fundamentally, what I appreciate most about the company is that its operating system (OS) represents the de-facto language of business. According to data from Statista.com, Microsoft Windows dominates the OS segment with over 76% market share.In addition, the company’s Software as a Solution (SaaS) platform should enjoy permanent relevance. Its Office suite simply stands lightyears ahead of the competition. Yet Wall Street doesn’t seem to take into account the company’s incredible, arguably unparalleled utility. On a year-to-date basis through the Oct. 5 session, MSFT slipped almost 26%.Story continuesNevertheless, this factor helps the case for MSFT as one of the cheap tech stocks to buy. Gurufocus.com labels Microsoft’s business modestly undervalued. The company enjoys strengths across the board, starting from its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.61. This compares favorably to the industry median of 1.2. As well, Microsoft commands growth and profitability metrics that stand within the top echelon of the software sector.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockFounded in 2006 in Eindhoven, Netherlands, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a semiconductor designer and manufacturer. Its chip-building innovations undergird several industries, including automotive, communication infrastructures and industrial applications. In addition, NXP offers solutions for smart city networks as jurisdictions plan the next phase in connectivity.Despite the longer-term implications of NXP, its equity shares suffered throughout the year thus far. Since Jan., NXPI stock fell more than 30%. Still, forward-looking investors may be able to snag a discount. Fundamentally, unless you assume that we’ll go back to the Stone Ages, NXP’s innovation in the connectivity sphere seems a reasonable wager.According to Gurufocus.com, the company features a modestly undervalued profile. Mainly, the soft point for NXPI stems from its okay balance sheet; it’s neither great nor terrible. However, it makes up for this softness through growth and profitability metrics.NXP’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.9%, better than nearly 60% of its peers. Its operating margin of 27% reflects performance superior to 84% of semiconductor competitors. Therefore, it’s a solid bet among cheap tech stocks to buy.Oracle (ORCL)lightbulb surrounded by business icons representing innovation and technologySource: PopTika / Shutterstock.comA multinational computer technology firm, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) specializes in various business applications such as database software, cloud engineered systems and enterprise software. For many top-level corporations, Oracle undergirds their supply chain management. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, this business arm represented a positive attribute.Following the onset of Covid-19, the narrative became more complicated. While Oracle never lost its relevance, supply chain disruptions and other macroeconomic headwinds hurt the business. Since the start of this year, ORCL stock declined 24%. Nevertheless, investors have an opportunity here as ORCL ranks among the cheap tech stocks to buy.According to Gurufocus.com, ORCL rates as modestly undervalued. To be fair, its balance sheet could use some work, I’m not going to shy away from this. However, the positives should help balance the equation favorably.Most notably, Oracle’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 12.9%. This beats out the industry median of 7.1%. Also, the company’s net margin is 13.2%, towering over 83% of its peers.Corning (GLW)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockAn American multinational tech firm, Corning (NYSE:GLW) is a global-leading innovator in materials science. Per its website, for nearly 170 years, “Corning has combined its unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramics science, and optical physics with deep manufacturing and engineering capabilities to develop life-changing innovations and products.”In other words, Corning’s role aligns with a stagehand for a major Broadway production. While it might not be the star of the program, the show wouldn’t go anywhere without capable stagehands. Therefore, GLW fundamentally makes for an intriguing case among cheap tech stocks to buy. However, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way for now, with GLW down nearly 16% YTD.It might be a mistake to ignore Corning. Per Gurufocus.com, the company features a modestly undervalued business. Here, the fiscal profile is a bit more balanced than some other cheap tech stocks. Combined with decent financial strength, Corning enjoys robust growth and profitability metrics.Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.6%, better than 73% of its peers. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin pings at 13.7%. That’s better than nearly 85% of the industry.Panasonic (PCRFY)Tech stocks illustration. Representing PBTS stock.Source: whiteMocca / ShutterstockWhen it comes to the electric vehicle revolution, Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) makes a compelling case for cheap tech stocks to buy. Sure, you can always buy shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In fact, as of this writing, Gurufocus.com labels TSLA as significantly undervalued. However, Panasonic’s relevance comes in the form of its innovative EV battery technologies.Fundamentally, let’s just imagine that in the future, Tesla loses its luster. It could happen with several major legacy automakers pivoting sharply to EVs. At that point, any number of brands could be the definitive sector leader. But to get there, they will need superior battery tech. Panasonic already amassed a significant lead and it might not give it up.For now, contrarian investors will likely appreciate its discounted premium. Per Gurufocus.com, PCRFY rates as modestly undervalued. Here, the emphasis centers on decent stability in the balance sheet and solid profitability metrics.Granted, Panasonic’s weakness is in the growth arena. However, because the company enjoys a dominant profile in the burgeoning EV battery segment, the growth will likely come. Therefore, PCRFY ranks as one of the cheap tech stocks to buy.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMoving into the final two market ideas for cheap tech stocks, I’m going to dial up the risk-reward profile. First, let’s discuss digital payments and business services platform PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Fundamentally, the company aligns with the burgeoning gig economy. One factor that may help PayPal is the return-to-the-office narrative. With a possible recession on the way, employers may eventually force an ultimatum on their employees.Most will probably succumb to the pressure because you don’t want to lose a paycheck during rough economic times. Still, a stubborn few will likely branch out on their own and thus join the gig economy. Already, experts project this segment to reach a valuation of at least $455 billion next year. Current workforce drama will bolster this framework, thus possibly making PYPL one of the cheap tech stocks to buy.Now, for the numbers. Gurufocus.com labels PYPL significantly undervalued. Despite PYPL’s sharp losses in the open market, PayPal enjoys a balanced fiscal profile. Most notably, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.5% (compared to industry median of 2.3%). Also, its return on equity stands at nearly 10%, ranked better than 64% of its peers.Adobe (ADBE)ADBE stock adobe stockSource: ShutterstockWhen mentioning Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as one of the cheap tech stocks to buy, an immediate response may be that there’s a reason for it. Perhaps best known for its Photoshop software, Adobe is a king among creatives. The problem? Many folks regard the creatives sector as a hobby, lacking much financial or utilitarian rigor.However, data regarding the rise of the gig economy suggests otherwise. According to one source, graphics designers represent the largest component in the freelancing space, comprising 90% of the segment. Personally, I find this stat difficult to believe. Nevertheless, I’m sharing my sources so you can be the judge.What’s less in question is Adobe’s financial discount. According to Gurufocus.com, ADBE rates as a significantly undervalued investment. Although ADBE shares fell 47% since the beginning of this year, the underlying firm offers a very encouraging picture. On the balance sheet, Adobe enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 9.3, meaning that it features low bankruptcy risk. For income, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.9%, better than 78% of its peers. On the bottom line, Adobe’s operating margin of over 35% beats out 97% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

SubscribeMonday, October 10, 2022Today's newsletter is by Brian Sozzi, an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.The money you have invested in the stock market is at big risk of being further vaporized in the remaining weeks of October. Full stop.That's not a scare tactic so you share this newsletter with five friends. It's just the assessment of one person who has been doing this close to 20 years now. I think investors took too many hits on the ""hopium pipe"" (thanks RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas for this new fin-term for my vast arsenal) during the two-day, rip-your-face off rally to start the fourth quarter.Now, it's reality check time again as the high wears off.Here are a few risks barreling toward you...Inflation dataThis week, inflation data in the form of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), and price expectations from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are coming out. The CPI report is arguably the most important at the moment as investors look for signs that inflation is cooling at the hands of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes.The problem is that the CPI report isn't expected to slow much on a month-to- month basis. ""Core inflation continues to wield significant momentum,"" Wells Fargo Economist Sarah House pointed out in a client note.In turn, that sets the table for a harsh market reaction like what we saw on Friday to a too-hot September jobs report.Raw earnings numbersWarnings in recent weeks from AMD, Micron, Nike, FedEx highlight how crappy this earnings season will be. The negative reactions to those warnings underscore how the market hasn't truly priced in downside risks from the stronger dollar, still-high inflation, and the higher cost of capital.Story continuesThe ugliness of the top and bottom lines could surprise investors, even when considering expectations have been marked lower.Consensus expects 3% year-over-year EPS growth for S&amp;P 500 companies, 13% sales growth, and 75 basis points of margin contraction to 11.8%, according to data crunched by Goldman Sachs. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to fall by 3% and margins to contract by 132 basis points.I expect investors to be reminded of this new economic normal (which mirrors stagflation) in earnings out later this week from banks Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.Executive toneIf you hate listening to earnings calls, suck it up and get on them this earnings season. The economy is downshifting and you need every clue possible on companies to survive.I think the tones on conference calls will be decidedly bearish. Two good points on this one from Goldman Sachs:""Topics for managements to discuss: (1) headwind to sales due to a stronger U.S. dollar, (2) headwind to margins due to elevated inflation and high inventories, (3) tax changes effective in 2023."" All bearish topics.""Early guidance from managements has demonstrated the various headwinds to corporate profitability. CEO confidence for the six months ahead fell to levels last seen in 1980. Earlier in September, FedEx pre-announced a large EPS miss and withdrew 2023 guidance. More recently, Micron guided revenue and EPS below consensus expectations, citing uncertain demand and growing inventory. In addition, more than 10% of S&amp;P 500 market cap has pre-announced earnings this quarter, consistent with prior periods of high uncertainty as companies manage investor expectations."" Expect other companies to act in a similar fashion to these early reporters.On a more upbeat note, Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told me on Yahoo Finance Live demand for Corona and Modelo remain strong.

Its media business has a rich library of intellectual property, which provides a powerful engine for creating new content across the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands. This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade prior to the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.”Stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are also among the best fundamental stocks to buy.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British CompaniesMost Valuable Companies in HistoryTop 10 High Dividend Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
111,49da0b8d-4d80-3e38-9fdd-71d475b4a866,MCD,2022-10-10,Possible bearish signals as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders disposed of US$3.7m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-mcdonalds-corporation-130034233.html,1665320434,STORY,['MCD'],"[In the last year, many McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sThe Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$256 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$233. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.McDonald's Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders sold US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. McDonald's insiders own about US$162m worth of shares (which is 0.09% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?Insiders sold McDonald's shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing McDonald's. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with McDonald's and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

112,a9442e59-221c-3baf-b272-a900e30b7e01,PLD,2022-10-10,Investing in Prologis (NYSE:PLD) five years ago would have delivered you a 75% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-prologis-nyse-pld-five-120136157.html,1665403296,STORY,['PLD'],"[It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) share price down 23% in the last month. While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. After all, the stock has performed better than the market (52%) in that time, and is up 54%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Prologis While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Prologis achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Prologis' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Prologis' TSR for the last 5 years was 75%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 20% received by Prologis shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -21%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 12% per year over half a decade. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Prologis   (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Prologis is not the only stock insiders are buying.

On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 50%, less than the market return of 52%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 21% decline over the last twelve months.The past week has proven to be lucrative for American Express investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for American Express While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, American Express managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that American Express has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think American Express will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 5 years was 60%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican Express shareholders are down 20% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -21%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 10% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

But if you pick the right stock, you can make a lot more than 100%. For example, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) share price has soared 108% in the last 1 year. Most would be very happy with that, especially in just one year! It's also good to see the share price up 15% over the last quarter. It is also impressive that the stock is up 70% over three years, adding to the sense that it is a real winner.Since it's been a strong week for Occidental Petroleum shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Occidental Petroleum went from making a loss to reporting a profit, in the last year.When a company has just transitioned to profitability, earnings per share growth is not always the best way to look at the share price action.We are skeptical of the suggestion that the 0.7% dividend yield would entice buyers to the stock. However the year on year revenue growth of 73% would help. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Occidental Petroleum stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Occidental Petroleum has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 109% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 5% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Occidental Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Expensive borrowing has been hurting homebuyers and causing consumer demand weakness within the housing sector. With mortgage rates approaching 7%, the prices of lumber are falling and may be at or approaching a bottom. As of October 7, lumber is trading at $445 per 1000 board feet and has declined about 60% year to date.Housing Starts Rose Unexpectedly in AugustOn September 20, Reuters reported that new residential home construction in the U.S. rose in August. Housing starts, a measure of new residential construction, grew by 12.2% month-over-month to 1.58 million units in August, well above market consensus which sat at 1.44 million units. Starts for multi-family housing projects surged 28.6% month-over-month in August, driven by strong demand for rental apartments due to higher mortgages that are taking away the purchasing power of potential homebuyers. Single-family housing starts rose in August to 935,000 units and recorded a 3.4% month-over-month increase.Surging demand for multi-family housing projects is spurring activity in the volatile commodities market. Lumber futures have gained roughly 5% over the past five days as of October 7. Investors that are looking to capitalize on the current housing situation can position their portfolios for a rebound. Lumber prices have close ties to the housing market and though the housing sector is being pressured by higher interest rates and mortgage rates, the rise in multi-family starts can send lumber prices higher.

Meal plans are tailored to the medical needs of the recipient by a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN), and are designed to improve health outcomes, lower cost of care and increase patient satisfaction. Because of their complicated medical conditions, most of our clients are unable to eat the food offered by many other home-delivered meal providers. MTMs are delivered to an individual's home. In the last year, collectively, FIMC MTM providers served over 11 million meals to over 48,000 people across multiple states and the District of Columbia. Clients living with a primary diagnosis of HIV, cancer or diabetes made up the majority of those that received meals from FIMC agencies in the last year, however, the plurality of clients live with multiple diagnoses at once.

With 68% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$2.9b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 38% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about General Electric. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.General Electric already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see General Electric's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in General Electric. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 8.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.8% and 6.3% of the stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of General Electric Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$172m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 32% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

123,9f6bd2f6-fb2f-320b-ab00-e06be107e624,PGR,2022-10-10,Should Weakness in The Progressive Corporation's (NYSE:PGR) Stock Be Seen As A Sign That Market Will Correct The Share Price Given Decent Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-progressive-corporations-nyse-pgr-110044871.html,1665399644,STORY,['PGR'],"[Progressive (NYSE:PGR) has had a rough month with its share price down 5.2%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Progressive's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.4% = US$852m ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.4% ROEOn the face of it, Progressive's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 11%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, the moderate 14% net income growth seen by Progressive over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Progressive's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is PGR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Progressive Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Progressive has a three-year median payout ratio of 49%, which implies that it retains the remaining 51% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, Progressive is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 48%. Regardless, the future ROE for Progressive is predicted to rise to 22% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Progressive has some positive aspects to its business. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study UnitedHealth Group's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:23% = US$19b ÷ US$81b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirst thing first, we like that UnitedHealth Group has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 15% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by UnitedHealth Group over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that UnitedHealth Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 18% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Genpact Ltd. G.Industry: OutsourcingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1989079/3-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-outsourcing-industryOperational efficiency and reduced expenses in the wake of the coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave and increased adoption of cloud computing and other emerging technologies bode well for the Zacks Outsourcing industry. These drive competitive advantage, and increase innovation and speed-to-market.Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and Genpact Ltd. are some stocks that are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends. However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Industry DescriptionOutsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations, services or processes, previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources, to external resources or third-party contractors to improve operating efficiency by focusing on core business competencies. The Zacks Outsourcing industry comprises companies engaged in providing human capital management solutions, business management solutions and information technology solutions for human resource, payroll, benefits, and retirement and insurance services to small- and medium-sized businesses. Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Story continuesRising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Notably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Security Issues and Remedies: Increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, increased implementation of secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as increased monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees on emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #40. This rank places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The buy-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been increasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has increased 4.7%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can buy given their growth prospects, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Outsourcing industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 3.3% over this period against a 43% decline of the broader sector and 14.9% decline of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing outsourcing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.19X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.2X and the sector’s 21.31X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.89X, as low as 17.89X and at the median of 23.58X.3 Outsourcing Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that are well positioned to grow in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Automatic Data Processing: This New Jersey-based company provides cloud-based human capital management solutions worldwide. ADP’s three-tier business strategy helps it maintain and grow its strong position as a human capital management (HCM) technology and services provider.The company is focused on delivering a complete suite of cloud-based HCM and HR Outsourcing solutions. Strategic acquisitions like Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company have strengthened ADP’s customer base and are helping it expand operations in international markets. It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure. Further, it continues to innovate, improve operations and invest in its ongoing transformation efforts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADP’s 2022 EPS has moved up 3.2% in the past 90 days. ADP’s shares have rallied 13.2% over the past year.Paychex: This New York-based company provides integrated human capital management solutions.Paychex continues to benefit from growth in its payroll client bases and product penetration across HCM offerings, resulting from strong sales performance and high levels of retention, high demand for HR Solutions, improved revenues per client resulting from higher employment levels within the company’s client base and enhanced price realization, and expansion of HCM ancillary services. An increase in the number of average worksite employees, the impact of an increase in average wages per worksite employee, higher revenues on state unemployment insurance and a rise in PEO health insurance revenues act as other tailwinds.Additionally, cost-saving initiatives result in sequential improvement of margins. Acquisitions have expanded Paychex's customer base besides generating cost and revenue synergies. Consistency in rewarding shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases boosts investor confidence and positively impacts earnings per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paychex’s 2022 EPS has improved 1.7% in the past 90 days. PAYX stock has declined 5.8% over the past year.Genpact Ltd.: This Bermuda-based company provides business process outsourcing and IT services in North and Latin America, India, the rest of Asia and Europe.

AI offers ample growth opportunities amid the COVID-induced dependency on technology.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Genpact’s 2022 EPS has improved 0.4% in the past 90 days. G stock has declined 5.3% over the past year.Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

If you want to see some more of the best fundamental stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy.A good fundamentals stock is a stock of a company that's profitable and that has durable competitive advantages to maintain its profitability over time and to grow. Ideally that company would also be well run and have substantial growth opportunities in its future. That company would have scale and a strong history of earnings.Furthermore the best fundamental stocks would also include those aforementioned companies that also trade for a potential discount to their long term value. In terms of metrics, indicators such as a strong history of profits and history of returning profits back to shareholders is important. A history of dividends can also help.Currently, the market is facing several headwinds including rising interest rates and also a potentially slowing economy. Despite the economy potentially slowing, inflation is still a problem as well.Due to all the headwinds, the market has declined substantially with even many of the leading high quality stocks down over 20%+ year to date. In terms of the major indexes, the NASDAQ is down around 32%, the S&amp;P 500 is down around 23.6% and the Dow Jones is down around 19.3%.While the market could decline further given geopolitical events or if the economic data fails to meet expectations, there is also potential opportunity for long term investors to buy quality stocks.In the long term, quality companies with strong fundamentals could increase their earnings over time and potentially be worth more in times when the market is more bullish in terms of valuations on earnings.Given the market decline, the stocks of many quality companies are on sale, and there are several companies that could potentially fit in the list of the 10 best fundamentals stocks to buy.Where to Invest?Copyright: hin255 / 123RF Stock PhotoStory continuesMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy, we used subjective measures to pick 10 stocks that have a strong history of quality earnings that also trade for reasonable valuations.We then ranked the 10 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database who held shares in the stocks at the end of Q2.10 Best Fundamental Stocks To Buy10.

Its media business has a rich library of intellectual property, which provides a powerful engine for creating new content across the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands. This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade prior to the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.”Stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

136,44d74e2d-b1bb-3869-acc0-f4b3016271c3,REGN,2022-10-10,"Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:REGN) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-regn-130108243.html,1665320468,STORY,['REGN'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:REGN) stock increased significantly by 16% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:27% = US$5.7b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.27 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 23% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' considerable five year net income growth of 38% was to be expected.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 21% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for REGN? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

137,69987a08-1f57-37db-8b34-ea0795bd5206,AMP,2022-10-10,"Following a 1.0% decline over last year, recent gains may please Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-1-0-decline-over-111536921.html,1665400536,STORY,['AMP'],"[If you want to know who really controls Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 7.9% increase in share prices after a year of 1.0% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ameriprise Financial. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Ameriprise Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Ameriprise Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Ameriprise Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 13% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$114m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Ameriprise Financial. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Ameriprise Financial .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
