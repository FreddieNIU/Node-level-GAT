3,7507762a-9cef-3631-862a-d5729f0d6d25,WDC,2024-05-18,4 Incomparable Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7507762a-9cef-3631-862a-d5729f0d6d25/4-incomparable-growth-stocks.html,1716023160,STORY,"['COMP', 'META', 'FVRR', 'BMRN', 'WDC']","[""Wall Street has been a stomping ground for volatility since this decade began. Although it's been a banner start to 2024, it was preceded by four consecutive years where the major stock indexes traded off bear and bull markets. No widely followed index has been more volatile than the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)."", ""In 2022, the index was mired in a bear market and shed 33% of its value by the time the year came to a close. But since the opening bell rang in 2023, this innovation-powered index has rallied a cool 60% and hit a fresh record high. There's absolutely no doubt that the Nasdaq is in a bull market -- albeit a fairly new one."", 'Despite the Nasdaq Composite climbing to a new all-time high on May 15, plain-as-day bargains among growth stocks can still be found. Opportunistic investors simply have to be willing to look for amazing deals.', 'What follows are four incomparable growth stocks you might regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.', ""The first matchless growth stock that's begging to be bought with the relatively young Nasdaq bull market stretching its legs is social media leader\xa0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Though Meta's forecast for higher capital expenditures recently spooked Wall Street, it possesses a couple of well-defined competitive advantages that allow this short-term headwind to be easily brushed off."", 'To start with the obvious, Meta Platforms is the parent of many of the most-visited social sites globally. It owns Facebook (the most-visited social site), along with Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger.', 'Collectively, its family of apps drew 3.24 billion daily active users during the first quarter and close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Advertisers are going to be hard-pressed to find a social media platform with a broader reach.', 'To add to the above, Meta benefits from disproportionately long periods of economic growth. Although advertising is highly cyclical and recessions are an unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, periods of expansion last substantially longer than contractions. In simpler terms, long-term investors in ad-driven companies (Meta generates almost 98% of its sales from ads) are often handsomely rewarded.', ""Another reason current and prospective Meta investors shouldn't be too concerned with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on artificial intelligence (AI), the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices is the company's phenomenal war chest and cash flow. The company closed out March with more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated around $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations. As a cash cow, Zuckerberg's company has the luxury of investing for the future, even if the fruits of those investments won't be realized for years."", ""Lastly, Meta Platforms' stock is still a phenomenal bargain. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times consensus cash flow for 2025, which represents a 12% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the previous five years."", ""A second incomparable growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq pushing to new highs is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR). Despite worries that AI would adversely affect its operating performance, multiple dynamics appear to be working in the company's favor."", ""Although Fiverr's stock has retraced more than 90% from its all-time high, the macro environment couldn't be more favorable for its long-term success. While some workers have returned to the office following the worst of the pandemic, more people than ever are working remotely. This sizable increase in mobile workers is just what the doctor ordered for Fiverr's gig-economy-driven platform for freelancers."", ""As I've pointed out in the past, Fiverr's transparency is another key selling point. Rather than follow in the footsteps of many of its peers and have freelancers price their services on an hourly basis, Fiverr has its freelancers provide an all-encompassing price for their tasks. This transparency is likely the fuel that keeps powering spending per buyer higher."", 'But the secret sauce that makes Fiverr International a stellar investment is its take rate -- i.e., the percentage of revenue it gets to keep from negotiated deals on its platform, including fees. Whereas most of its competition has a take rate in the mid to high teens, it closed out March with a take rate of 32.3%, up 190 basis points from the comparable period in 2023. The company is keeping more and generating successively higher spending per buyer.', ""The icing on the cake is that Fiverr also unveiled a share-repurchase program for up to $100 million. Buying back stock could accelerate the growth in the company's double-digit adjusted earnings per share (EPS)."", ""The third unparalleled growth stock you'll likely be kicking yourself for not adding during the early innings of the new Nasdaq bull market is specialty biotech BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN). Although the launch of Roctavian, a one-time gene therapy treatment for patients with hemophilia A, has been marred by challenges (sales of the drug totaled just $800,000 in the first quarter), one bad apple isn't going to spoil BioMarin's juicy portfolio of novel therapies."", ""Before digging into product specifics, it's important to recognize that BioMarin focuses its efforts on drugs for ultra-rare diseases. While there are risks associated with small pools of patients, the rewards are plentiful. Namely, such drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often face little or no pushback from insurers regarding their high list prices, and they usually have minimal or nonexistent competition."", ""Even with Roctavian stumbling out of the gate, growth from dwarfism drug Voxzogo has more than made up for this fumble. Label expansion opportunities have broadened Voxzogo's use case, which in turn sent sales rocketing higher by 74% to nearly $153 million during the March-ended quarter. Increased uptake and strong pricing power should give Voxzogo a legitimate shot at eventually topping $1 billion in annual sales."", ""BioMarin's management also recently made the decision to focus its efforts and capital on its most-promising experimental therapies. By narrowing its clinical studies to three candidates, the company aims to reduce its annual operating expenses by up to $40 million."", ""With more than a half-dozen FDA-approved drugs in its portfolio, BioMarin should be able to sustain double-digit sales and EPS growth through at least 2027. In fact, Wall Street's consensus calls for its EPS to catapult from a reported $0.87 in 2023 to almost $5 by 2027."", ""A fourth incomparable growth stock you could regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is storage solutions specialist Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC). In spite of some spotty demand weakness from its consumer segment (i.e., personal computer sales have remained weak), numerous other aspects of Western Digital's operations are firing on all cylinders."", ""The first unmistakable catalyst is the AI revolution. Whereas artificial intelligence has created worry for some businesses, it's set to catapult demand for Western Digital. High-compute AI data centers require ever-growing computational needs, which in turn is going to accelerate demand for data-center storage solutions."", ""Something else to consider is that enterprise spending on cloud-based platforms is still in its early innings. As cloud spending ramps up, Western Digital's data-center storage products come into focus. Not surprisingly, the company's cloud segment was its biggest growth driver in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 29), with a year-over-year sales increase of 29%!"", ""Pricing power and utility should also work in the business' favor. Although hard drives have long been a data center staple, Western Digital's NAND flash-memory solutions support higher transfer rates and consume less power. As NAND flash-memory adoption increases, the company's pricing power should improve."", ""The final piece of the puzzle is that Western Digital's bottom line is set to do a major about-face. After the company reported a $3.59-per-share loss in fiscal 2023, Wall Street is looking for close to $8 in positive EPS next year. This is a company that should benefit for years to come from growth in the cloud and AI."", 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Western Digital (WDC), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Western Digital currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if WDC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers holds up."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For WDC, shares are up 0.92% over the past week while the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry is up 1.69% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.46% compares favorably with the industry's 8.46% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Western Digital have increased 33.03% over the past quarter, and have gained 91.28% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.17% and 30.61%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to WDC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. WDC is currently averaging 6,804,931 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with WDC.', ""Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost WDC's consensus estimate, increasing from -$1.44 to -$0.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that WDC is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Western Digital on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported earnings of 70 cents. The reported quarter’s earnings included expenses related to FDIC special assessment.Results were aided by an increase in non-interest income and deposits and a decline in provisions. However, lower net interest income (NII) and loan balance, along with higher expenses, were the undermining factors.Net income was $48 million, down 9.3% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $46.6 million.', 'Quarterly net revenues were $241.7 million, declining 1.1% year over year. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $239.84 million.NII was $214.9 million, decreasing 5.7%. NIM contracted 5 basis points (bps) to 2.57%. Our estimates for NII and NIM were $215.9 million and 2.61%, respectively.Non-interest income of $26.9 million jumped 62.5% from the prior-year quarter. The increase was mainly due to net gain on investment securities. We had projected non-interest income of $22.8 million.Non-interest expenses rose 4.2% to $159.2 million. The increase was mainly due to a rise in employee compensation and benefits costs, deposit insurance expenses, and other non-interest expenses. The expenses included $5.2 million related to the adjustment to FDIC special assessment. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $160 million.As of Mar 31, 2024, total loans were $24.23 billion, down 1.7% from the prior quarter. Total deposits amounted to $27.03 billion, up 1.8%.

But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target.', 'To start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year.', 'Another major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options.', 'Walmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line', 'Target is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues.

Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.', 'In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.', 'With respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor.

As restaurant traffic falls, grocers and mass retailers are swooping in with low-priced offerings to help consumers find easy and affordable meal solutions.\xa0', 'In an interview with CNBC, Rainey said that the high price of fast food has spurred more shoppers to head to the retailer’s grocery aisles. “It’s roughly 4.3 times more expensive to eat out than it is to eat at home,” he told the news outlet. “And that’s benefiting our business.”', 'Correction: The article misstated when bettergoods debuted.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Xylem (XYL), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Xylem currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if XYL is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this water and wastewater treatment company holds up."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For XYL, shares are up 4.22% over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry is up 2.01% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.2% compares favorably with the industry's 1.6% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Xylem have increased 14.05% over the past quarter, and have gained 36.63% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.17% and 30.61%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to XYL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. XYL is currently averaging 1,303,772 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with XYL.', ""Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost XYL's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.13 to $4.21 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that XYL is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Xylem on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been so strong that the company has been finding it difficult to meet the end-market demand, leading to long waiting periods."", 'The good news is that Nvidia has been boosting its production capacity, and that explains why it is expected to deliver another year of solid growth in fiscal 2025 (which has just begun). Its top line is expected to grow nearly 84% this fiscal year to $112 billion, while the bottom line is expected to jump 91% to $24.87 per share. All this explains why investors have been piling into Nvidia stock, which has already gained more than 82% in 2024.', ""Nvidia looks well placed to justify its expensive trailing earnings multiple of 75, considering the potential growth it could deliver. The sharp increase in its earnings going forward is evident from a much lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37. However, investors who have missed Nvidia's terrific run-up and are wary of paying a rich earnings multiple can consider taking a closer look at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)."", ""Just like Nvidia, Microsoft is also a key player in the AI market, and it can be bought at a reasonable valuation right now. Here's why savvy investors should consider doing that right away."", ""Shares of Microsoft have gained only 10% so far this year. This explains why the stock can still be bought at a relatively reasonable earnings multiple of about 35, which is much lower than Nvidia's multiple. Microsoft's forward earnings multiple of 31 also represents a discount to that of Nvidia."", ""Of course, Microsoft isn't growing as rapidly as Nvidia, but it has been consistently beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in recent quarters, and its growth has been accelerating."", ""For instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), Microsoft's revenue increased 17% year over year to $61.9 billion. That was a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth the company clocked in the same period last year."", 'Additionally, Microsoft\'s earnings growth also improved to 20% year over year in the previous quarter, from 10% in the year-ago period. AI is playing a key role in this acceleration, as Microsoft management noted on the latest earnings conference call. CEO Satya Nadella remarked that the company\'s Azure cloud platform ""took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions.""', ""More specifically, AI drove 7 percentage points worth of growth for Microsoft's Azure cloud business last quarter out of the segment's year-over-year growth of 31%. The growth could have been stronger had Microsoft been able to meet all the AI-related demand for cloud services, but the company said that demand has been higher than supply."", 'This explains why Microsoft has been ramping up its spending on cloud AI infrastructure across the globe in countries such as Japan, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the U.S. Even better, recent reports indicate that the tech giant could spend $100 billion on building a generative AI supercomputer through 2028. As such, Microsoft is setting itself up to make the most of the booming demand for cloud AI services in the long run.', 'According to a third-party estimate, the cloud AI market was worth an estimated $43 billion in 2022. The market is expected to post 36% annual growth through 2032 and generate a whopping $887 billion in annual revenue. Microsoft has generated just over $100 billion in revenue from its Intelligent Cloud division business in the past year, and the incremental growth opportunity in the cloud AI market indicates that it has a lot of room to grow in this space.', ""Throw in the potential AI-related gains that Microsoft could achieve in the AI-enabled personal computer and workplace productivity markets, and it won't be surprising to see the company's growth accelerating further in the long run."", ""Analysts are expecting Microsoft's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 16% over the next five years, which would be a slowdown compared to its 20% annual earnings growth in the past five years. However, observers have already seen that Microsoft's bottom-line growth is accelerating thanks to AI. So, it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings growing at a faster pace in the future."", ""Assuming Microsoft manages to get an annual earnings growth rate of 25% over the next five years, its earnings could hit $29.93 per share in fiscal 2028 (using fiscal 2023 earnings of $9.81 per share as the base). Multiplying the projected earnings with Microsoft's five-year forward earnings of 29 points toward a stock price of $868 after five years -- a jump of 110% from current levels."", ""But if the market decides to reward Microsoft with a higher valuation or the company delivers stronger earnings growth, this AI stock could deliver much stronger gains. That's why investors who missed the Nvidia train should consider jumping onto Microsoft stock before it steps on the gas."", 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

As it continues to march higher, investors might be wondering if it's too late to buy."", 'Timing the market is next to impossible, but history shows time in the market is far more important when it comes to generating reliable returns. In fact, the S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.3% since it was established in 1957, which means an investment of $1,000 back then would be worth over $761,355 today.', 'Buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a great way to capture those gains in a diversified and secure manner. The Vanguard Group is one of the largest issuers of ETFs in the world, and it offers several funds designed to track the performance of popular indexes like the S&P 500.', ""Here's why investors sitting on idle cash might want to allocate $800 to buy one share of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) and one share of the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG)."", 'The objective of the VOO ETF is to simply track the performance of the S&P 500. It achieves this by holding a stake in all 500 companies in the index, with very similar weightings.', ""The S&P 500 is incredibly diversified, which makes it a great choice for investors of all experience levels. It's home to 11 different sectors, including information technology, healthcare, energy, financials, and real estate, so it covers a broad cross-section of the U.S. economy."", 'Companies have to meet strict criteria for admission into the S&P 500, which include having a minimum market capitalization of $18 billion, and a requirement that they must be profitable, so it automatically filters out high-risk stocks that can be prone to volatility.', ""The top five holdings in the VOO ETF (and the S&P 500) come from the information technology sector, because it hosts the world's largest technology companies:"", 'Stock', 'VOO ETF Portfolio Weighting', '1. Microsoft', '6.83%', '2. Apple ', '5.83%', '3. Nvidia', '5.04%', '4. Amazon', '3.77%', '5. Alphabet Class A', '2.26%', 'Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 30, 2024 and are subject to change.', 'Those five companies have proven track records of success spanning decades, and they continue to lead the charge in new technology segments like artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft is weaving AI into its entire product portfolio, thanks in part to its $10 billion investment into ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year. Apple also plans to bring AI capabilities to its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, from the iPhone to the Mac line of computers.', ""But AI wouldn't be possible without Nvidia. It designs the industry's most powerful chips for the data center, which is where developers build, train, and deploy their AI models. Simply put, despite its diverse composition, the VOO ETF still gives investors exposure to the most exciting segments of the technology industry."", ""The VOO ETF is also popular for its cheap holding costs. It has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, which is deducted from the fund's total assets each year to cover staff, marketing, and general operational expenses. Vanguard says comparable funds in the industry charge 0.79% on average, which eats away at investors' returns over the long run."", 'Investors who want to track the performance of the S&P 500 index (which I outlined earlier) should look no further than the VOO ETF.', 'Investors who want the opportunity to earn a higher return by taking a little more risk should consider the VOOG ETF. It tracks the S&P 500 Growth Index, which exclusively holds 228 of the fastest-growing stocks from the S&P 500 index.', 'It selects those stocks based on their revenue growth, the ratio of their earnings change to their stock price, and their momentum. The same 11 S&P 500 sectors are represented in this index, but their weightings are very different. For example, information technology accounts for 29.2% of the S&P 500, but it accounts for 46.8% of the S&P 500 Growth Index. Why? Because tech companies tend to grow more quickly than their peers.', 'Therefore, unsurprisingly, the top five holdings in the VOOG ETF are exactly the same as those in the VOO ETF, but pay close attention to their weightings -- Microsoft, for example, represents 12.48% of the total value of VOOG, compared to just 6.83% for VOO.', 'Stock', 'VOOG ETF Portfolio Weighting', '1.

Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 30, 2024 and are subject to change.', ""The high weighting toward technology stocks is the source of VOOG's outperformance relative to VOO (which I'll quantify in a moment). Nvidia stock, for example, has soared 223% over the past year, so naturally the ETF that holds more Nvidia stock has produced higher returns."", 'There are a couple of caveats. First, if technologies like AI fail to live up to the hype, tech stocks might suffer a period of underperformance that will drag down the returns of the VOOG ETF, at least until its portfolio is rebalanced to reflect that new reality.', 'Second, VOOG has an expense ratio of 0.1%, which is slightly higher than that of the VOO ETF (but is still cheap relative to the industry), so investors will pay a premium for the opportunity to earn higher returns.', ""Over the past year, the VOOG ETF has delivered a gain of 26.6% compared to the 22.6% return in the VOO ETF. Since its inception in 2010, VOOG has delivered a compound annual return of 15.3%, compared to 14% for VOO.

Generative AI, which can create text, images, videos, and audio, looks likely to be a transformative technology. Tech leaders like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices are betting heavily on AI to drive growth.', 'While the stocks of all three of those AI-centric companies have surged over the past year, they have been beaten handily by a stock that has absolutely nothing to do with AI. Investing is about more than chasing buzzwords. The tried-and-true method of finding unappreciated companies with solid growth prospects trading at pessimistic valuations still works.', 'This mystery stock has more than doubled over the past year, beating all three of the aforementioned tech companies by large margins. It has also trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD over the past three years, nearly tripling in that time.', 'The stock is Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: SFM), a small chain of grocery stores that does things differently from the major supermarket chains. That strategy has been paying off, and Sprouts still has plenty of growth ahead as it expands its footprint.', ""Sprouts operated 414 stores in 23 states as of March 31. Each store is relatively small. Its older stores are around 30,000 square feet, while its newer stores are even smaller at approximately 23,000 square feet. While the size of traditional supermarkets varies, they're often substantially larger."", ""Keeping its stores small reduces the cost of building new stores, lowers the ongoing operating costs, and allows Sprouts to build in locations where larger supermarkets wouldn't make sense. The average new store costs just $3.8 million. First-year sales average $13 million, with 20% to 25% annual growth over the following four years."", 'Sprouts focuses on two things: produce and attribute-based items. Each store features a large produce section with affordable prices. It makes a point to beat competitors on price.', ""About 70% of the products Sprouts sells are attribute-based -- meaning gluten-free, organic, vegan, non-GMO, and the like. It doesn't try to compete with the big supermarket chains on selection, instead curating a differentiated assortment of products.

You likely also realize, however, that many growth stocks require a great deal of ongoing monitoring. That's not something most investors want to do or even have time to do."", ""Fortunately, there's a simple solution: Buy a basket of growth stocks that someone else updates as needed. The Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) is your best bet among these baskets right now."", ""They're called exchange-traded funds, or ETFs for short. Just as the name implies, these are mutual funds in the sense that they hold several different stocks in their portfolios (so investors need only to own a stake in the fund in question). But since they're bought and sold in real time, just like conventional stocks, they're also considered exchange-traded instruments."", 'But why the Vanguard Growth ETF instead of similar alternatives, like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: IWF), the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: IVW), or even the popular Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ)?', 'Those exchange-traded funds have their merits, to be sure. However, the Vanguard Growth ETF boasts a handful of competitive advantages.', ""Chief among these advantages is its low cost to you. Its annualized expense ratio currently stands at a mere 0.04%, meaning the costs associated with managing and maintaining the fund only shave about 0.04% off the average yearly performance of the stocks held within the fund. For perspective, the Invesco QQQ Trust's expense ratio is 5 times greater at 0.2% of the fund's value, while the two iShares ETFs in question sport expense ratios similar to that of the QQQ Trust."", ""But does the Invesco fund's superior performance over the past 20 years make this added expense worth it?"", ""There's no denying that shares of QQQ have been a fantastic investment in recent history. The underpinnings of these gains, however, aren't necessarily sustainable. The underlying Nasdaq-100 Index has done exceedingly well of late, largely because it comprises names like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft -- stocks of companies that just so happened to be in the right place at the right time, so to speak."", 'But many of these organizations are now starting to see slower growth rates. Being overweighted with mega-cap companies, the Nasdaq-100 could be on the verge of a prolonged period of subpar performance.', ""This is in slight contrast to the better-balanced Vanguard Growth ETF. It's built to reflect the performance of the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) US Large Cap Growth Index, which also holds sizable stakes in the aforementioned Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple."", 'But with nearly 200 different constituents, including NYSE-listed tickers like healthcare outfit Eli Lilly and credit card middleman Visa, the Vanguard Growth ETF is arguably better positioned to stand up to cyclical weakness that takes dead aim at most technology stocks.', 'In such a scenario, the nickels and dimes stemming from differing expense ratios can start to add up.', ""Don't misread the message. The Vanguard Growth ETF is still a growth investment and, as such, is fully capable of dishing out sea-sickening volatility. That's not apt to change in the foreseeable future. If you need stability, look elsewhere, or at least don't make this particular exchange-traded fund the bulk of your portfolio."", ""Conversely, don't let neglect of several seemingly small things sneak up on you and end up crimping your long-term results. The Vanguard Growth ETF offers healthy growth potential at a reasonable level of risk. It also requires no ongoing effort from you since the CRSP -- and, therefore, Vanguard -- swaps out any of the index's or fund's stocks as needed."", ""And that's an added benefit in and of itself of holding this fund."", ""See, even most veteran investors can struggle to decide when to buy or sell a stock, often doing themselves more harm than good. With a third party making scheduled rebalances of the index, though, the risk of trying to time the market is negated.

Nvidia has moved up the ranks quickly thanks to its industry-leading AI-centric computer chips, currently worth $2.3 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms round out the other top 10 AI players, with market caps of between $2.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion.', ""With a market cap of roughly $789 billion (as of this writing), it seems clear that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is bucking for membership in this elite fraternity. Given the accelerating demand for the semiconductors needed for AI, TSMC's admittance might come sooner than later."", ""As the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC is in an enviable position in the industry. The company doesn't make semiconductors for its own use, but rather is contracted to make them for big tech companies, including Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others."", ""Once upon a time, the bulk of TSMC's revenue came from processors used in smartphones, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes chips used for AI, has taken the top spot, recently accounting for 46% of revenue."", 'Business is picking up. In the first quarter, revenue climbed 16.5% to $18.9 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 edged 5% higher. Management is expecting its accelerating growth to continue, forecasting second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 28%.', ""TSMC is in an enviable position in the AI revolution. It's a foundry partner to the AI stars, and since it makes chips for all comers, it's not a part of the fierce competition for AI chip supremacy. Given its position in the space and its current size, I don't think it will take very long to join the society of trillionaires."", 'According to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $84.8 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 9.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $107 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.', 'Interestingly, Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 22% in both 2024 and 2025. If the company achieves those fairly reasonable benchmarks, it could easily achieve a $1 trillion market cap by 2026.', ""There could be much more to come. TSM's management expects the company's AI-related revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the coming five years and account for 20% of TSM's total revenue by 2028."", ""That's not surprising, considering the magnitude of the opportunity. Generative AI is expected to generate economic value of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. However, estimates continue to ratchet higher as more applications for AI join the mix."", 'Finally, at just 24 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors an inexpensive way to profit from the AI revolution.', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

In a subsequent interview with CNBC, CEO Laxman Narasimhan identified the company\'s problem from his perspective by saying: ""We have not been able to communicate to [occasional customers] the value that we provide.""', 'One week later, Starbucks started rolling out the deals for the 33 million users of its mobile app. The company hopes to win business from occasional customers by providing bargains.', ""I believe it's the wrong (and a potentially costly) move for Starbucks. And it's what I'm most concerned about as a shareholder right now."", ""In Q2, the North America division of Starbucks saw a 3% drop in same-store sales. This was comprised of a 4% increase in average ticket and a 7% drop in transactions. Translation: Prices are up but sales are down because people aren't buying from Starbucks as frequently."", ""The solution from Starbucks' management: Let's lower prices and compel them to buy from us."", 'In North America, Starbucks had a Q2 operating profit of $1.1 billion, which is good -- but it was down 6% year over year. And it was down despite the higher prices it charged. Herein lies a danger for the company: Lower prices could stimulate sales at its locations, yes. But unless it gets a big boost from running promotions, its profits could continue to drop.', 'The risk to its already struggling profits is one reason that Starbucks could be on the wrong path. But commentary from former longtime CEO Howard Schultz highlights another reason. Schultz said: ""U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company\'s fall from grace.""', ""Evidently, former CEO Schultz is diagnosing Starbucks' problem differently than current CEO Narasimhan. But Schultz might have more concrete data on his side of the argument. In the Q2 earnings call, management said that its order completion rate took a hit because app users are frustrated with wait times and product availability."", ""To be clear, Starbucks' app users are among its most loyal customers -- these aren't the folks that you want to be losing. But circling back to management's plan, it's trying to drive traffic from occasional customers with bargains, not loyal customers."", ""This could actually worsen Starbucks' existing problems, because more people taking advantage of limited-time promotions could lead to even longer wait times. It risks further frustrating loyal customers, and it would do so while lowering profit margins from lower prices."", ""The more I allow this plan to percolate in my mind, the more I think Starbucks is making the wrong move here. On one hand, the stock is trading at a once-in-a-decade valuation, which is enticing for value investors. But on the other hand, it doesn't matter that the stock is cheap if management can't accurately assess and fix the problems."", 'It\'s as Schultz also said: ""It\'s not the miss that matters. It\'s what comes next.""', ""Long wait times and lack of product availability speak to an operational problem. If Starbucks addressed these issues with intention and energy, then they could probably be resolved in under a year. But since it's focused on driving traffic through limited-time bargains, it may take some time to realize it's on the wrong path, course-correct, and get to fixing the real issues. Starbucks' operational recovery could consequently still be a ways off."", ""Fortunately, Starbucks is a strong brand and can withstand periods of waning consumer enthusiasm -- at least it has in the past. Therefore, I believe the business will be fine over the long term. But I wouldn't expect the stock to perk up until operations are showing signs of improvement.

It's one of the world's biggest companies (as measured by market cap), while its stock is one of the market's best-performing equities since the company went public back in 1997, up nearly 250,000% from that point. You may even be a shareholder."", ""As the adage goes, though, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Although Amazon stock's historical performance is nothing less than incredible, there are more promising prospects for the foreseeable future. Here's a closer look at three of these better bets."", ""Don't panic if you already own a stake in Amazon. It's still a powerhouse company. You'll be fine."", ""If you have some idle cash you're ready to put to work with some new stock picks, though, consider stepping into the Amazon of China. That's Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), the parent company of China's e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao."", ""Any investor keeping tabs on China in general -- and Alibaba in particular -- likely knows the past few years have been tough. China's economy has been struggling due to the lingering impact of extended COVID-19 lockdowns. And Alibaba itself has been mired in internal challenges. It's teased the idea of divesting its cloud computing and logistics arms, for instance, suggesting the company doesn't have a great deal of faith that it can make either one as viable as it would like them to be."", ""Both spinoffs have been canceled in the meantime, though, with the company saying it will instead invest time and resources to make both of them better profit centers. The indecision tacitly suggests that Alibaba isn't actually sure what it should do; it may be doing something it doesn't actually want to do."", ""However, some important details are being overlooked amid all the corporate drama. That is, China's economy is seemingly on the mend. The country's consumer prices grew for a third straight month in April, while producer prices fell again, suggesting consumer demand is perking up."", ""Underscoring this argument is March's 3.1% year-over-year growth in China's retail sales on top of the hefty 10.6% retail-spending surge in March of last year. This progress is being made against the backdrop of the nation's first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.3%, accelerating from Q4's growth pace of 5.2%, making China one of the few countries to see its economy pick up steam during the three-month stretch."", ""Alibaba stock plunged this week anyway after its first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations. Just keep things in perspective. Last quarter's top line was still up 7% year over year. That's respectable for a company amid multiple overhauls. The stock's stumble is a buying opportunity."", ""When you think of coffee houses, you most likely think of coffee titan Starbucks. And rightfully so. There are nearly 39,000 Starbucks locales peppered across the planet, with roughly 16,600 of these stores found within the United States. It's tough not to come across one when you're out and about."", ""An up-and-coming coffee rival called Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS), however, should have Starbucks' management looking over its shoulders."", 'Dutch Bros is a distinctly different concept. Whereas the posh and polished feel of the typical Starbucks location was highly marketable during the early 2000s and then again in the 2000-teens, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a shift that was already underway even before the contagion took hold. That is, increasingly more consumers are now less interested in form and formality and are more interested in functional, casual experiences.', 'That\'s Dutch Bros, to be sure. It only operates coffee and beverage drive-thrus, and anyone who\'s visited one readily recognizes that each stand has its own personality reflecting the individual people working there. As the company says of itself, ""We may sell coffee, but we\'re in the relationship business.""', ""The thing is, the numbers and data suggest this is precisely what America's consumers increasingly want. Last quarter's top line was up 39% year over year, largely thanks to the 45 new stores opened during its fiscal first quarter ending in March. This only brings the store count up to 876 locations, far fewer than Starbucks' footprint. However, for Dutch Bros, the company's long-term target of 4,000 drive-thrus is certainly an achievable goal. The stock should reflect this growth as it's achieved."", ""Last but not least, add DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) to your list of unstoppable stocks that are better buys than Amazon at this time.\xa0Simply put, DraftKings is a sports-betting stock. In states where it's legal to do so, its app and website allow consumers to place various wagers on a wide range of sporting events."", ""It's not a brand-new business but is a relatively young and immature industry. The U.S. Supreme Court lifted the federal sports-betting ban in just 2018. Any such wagering before then was illegal, except in a handful of states. Even then, it was highly restricted. Although it's no longer federally prohibited, not every state permits it yet, and the ones that do aren't necessarily on board with mobile or internet-based sports betting."", ""The legalization movement is gaining traction, though. That's why Goldman Sachs believes the country's current yearly sports-betting handle (the total amount of money people wager) of around $10 billion could eventually swell to $45 billion. Market researcher Imarc further fleshes out the industry's prospective future by suggesting it will grow at an annualized pace of more than 12% through 2032."", ""DraftKings is already clearly showing it's capable of capitalizing on this opportunity, too. Last year's top line was up 66% year over year, nearly halving the company's operating loss. Analysts are calling for comparable growth all the way through 2027, with a swing to a profit in the cards as soon as next year."", ""See, not only do more legalization and more adoption obviously help, but DraftKings also becomes more fiscally efficient the longer it operates within a state and retains a customer. An acquired bettor tends to become profitable between the second and third year they're a DraftKings user."", ""Given that much of its customer base has not yet been around that long -- but soon will be -- don't be surprised to see profit growth dramatically outpace revenue growth from here. This, of course, creates a tailwind for the stock, which has been performing quite well of late anyway.

And personally, it\'s not what I would subscribe to. Mine is kind of like the ""have"". It\'s what do you have inside of you that you have to get out. It\'s not why I do something, it\'s just I\'ve identified something in me that\'s… it\'s like oxygen. It\'s ""I have to get this out of me"". You\'ve gotta find a greater purpose behind all of this stuff, because it\'s not about running a marathon or backflipping a motorcycle or climbing a mountain; it\'s why are you doing these things.', ""And ultimately, the way that I look at it and the way we built Dawson's Peak is, it's living with a purpose and using that purpose to help elevate others around you. It's understanding what you're doing and why you're doing it, and the impact you want to have on others. Because anyone can go out and train when it's pretty out, you go to the gym, all that kind of stuff; but when it gets… when you're years into a project, or when you're months into an expedition, or your toes are frozen, where you can't feel your hands, or you miss your family or whatever - the energy doesn't work at that point. It's that greater sense of what's inside of you that you have to get out, and why is it that important to you."", ""MEC: You are a fairly unique addition to the Monster roster; you're not a pro athlete, not an artist, not a gamer, not a Monster Girl (that we know of). You are a Monster Adventurer. Is that a title you think fits?"", ""MD: You know, it's something that I'm trying to earn. To be quite honest with you, I don't think I'm there yet. I think I've had the opportunity to do some fun things, and some interesting things, but as you and I have discussed, the more I do, the less impressed with it I am. And where I thought my limits were, now just every time I do something, I see my limits are so much more than I ever imagined. So, I think that that's hopefully a great representation of the Monster brand and why we've been so fortunate and honored to work with y'all to try to truly exemplify that."", ""MEC: How long have you been with Monster and what's it been like?"", ""MD: We started with Monster just before leaving for Everest in 2021, where I met with Dan McHugh, the CMO. He and I had a wonderful meeting… it was like I'd known him for 20 years. And that's how it really got started."", ""And you know, this is not me saying this just because you and I are speaking, I tell this to everybody I talk to: literally every single person I've met within the Monster organization, the Monster Family, has been enjoyable to work with. Or just to speak with, or just to spend time with. And the level of community and camaraderie that Monster has built is something very special. Being an investment banker working in mergers & acquisitions for the last 15-18 years, all I've done is work with companies. So I know company culture, I've been around dozens and dozens of companies, so I know something special when I see it. And what y'all built here is very special."", ""MEC: Aw that's very sweet of you to say Matt! So how did all this adventuring get started? As you say, you were on a very different life track, as an investment banking financial advisor…"", ""MD: To really scale the story down, I'd been working in banking for more than 10 years, I was successful at that to a degree where I lived a good life, I was comfortable financially and that kind of stuff… but there was this growing sense of emptiness that was inside of me for probably 20-30 years, and no matter what I did, nothing filled that hole. I felt that it just continued to develop and to evolve. It got to a point where it was almost crippling depression. If you saw my life on the outside you wouldn't have thought that; but on the inside, there were days where the thoughts of getting out of bed and putting my feet on the floor made me almost want to start crying. There was just so much internal pain - and I didn't know why. Because I looked at my life and I had everything, I've got friends, and opportunities, and means… it just didn't make sense. And it kept getting worse."", ""And roughly about that time I lost my mother and my girlfriend. And I just knew that it was time for a change. So I travelled to Nepal alone, spent three weeks wandering around Mount Everest, and on that trip just really broke through a bunch of personal thing that I needed to. The joke I make is, it was going far to go deep. I needed to do work, but the level of work I needed to do, I couldn't do it around the same people every day, in the same environments, doing the same things.And when I was on that trip - whatever you want to call it, God, or the Universe, or Energy, or Allah, or whatever it is to you - it spoke to me. And this thing, this presence said two things: 1) you're not living with a sense of purpose. And 2) your life is only about you."", 'And that, coupled with being in the Himalayas, where you truly understand how irrelevant we all are… just the scope of these mountains and the role we all play; everybody matters - but nobody is important. Just a destruction of the ego. It all just coalesced together. And I was like ""Maybe there\'s something here."" Because before this, I\'d never done any type of climbing, any type of trekking, any type of anything. To go from zero to over 17,000 feet was an interesting experience.', 'MEC: And this is the wildest part of it all, you just… did it. With no experience or training at all. So what was the hardest part? The most dangerous part? People die doing all of these things all the time. How many times have you said ""Fuck - I could die right here""?', 'MD: I don\'t say that… I say ""Now it\'s serious.""', 'MEC: Have you ever thought you were going to die?', ""MD: Yeah there were times where I was definitely concerned for my welfare, let's just put it that way. There are certain times where you get nervous, your mind starts speeding up, your heart starts speeding up. But then you cross over a threshold, where whatever can happen to you is right there, and it can be very bad very quickly - and you almost become calm. Because you understand - for want of a better term - if you lose your shit at that point, it's only going to hurt the situation. You've got to focus; everything else has got to go away, and you've got to get locked in and locked on"", ""MEC: So in all this crazy shit you've done, what was the most dangerous?"", ""MD: There's two sides: there's the hardest, and the most dangerous. I'd say the hardest thing - and this is probably not the answer you were thinking - was the training. Day in, day out. I've been training since August 1st, 2018, and since that time I have never missed a single workout. I've never skipped one workout."", 'MEC: WHAT??', ""MD: Yes. But I can tell you now, as much as I've enjoyed this, I don't enjoy it every day. And of those workouts, I think less than 10 of them were workouts that weren't completed exactly as written. There were days that maybe I didn't wanna do this big leg workout, but I got it done, because that's what you're supposed to do."", 'MEC: How often do you work out?', 'MD: I train 7 days a week.', ""MEC: You've trained every single day since August of 2018?"", 'MD: Yes. The only days that I would miss are travel days where I just physically could not train, or if I had scheduled periods for recovery, that was part of the training. I train on average 20-25 hours a week.', 'MEC: Incredible.', ""MD: It's that level of consistency; the days that you don't want to be there - and you're still there - is probably the most difficult part of it.In terms of the actual expeditions? The one that sticks out in my mind… people love to talk about Everest and high altitudes and all that kind of stuff, but the one that really sticks out was the row, the 53 day crossing of the Atlantic. It was just the monotony of the same thing, day in, day out. Once we started rowing, we didn't stop for 53 days. You're rowing for 24 hours a day, between you and your teammate. You row for 1-4 hour shifts, you sleep for 1-4 hour shifts. You can't push the pause button. And when you're not rowing, you're in the boat and you're cold and you're wet and it's loud, and it never stops moving. That was the first time I'd done an expedition like that were you just don't get a break. For nearly 2 months. Imagine an NBA game that lasts for 53 days! Which is essentially what it is."", ""MEC: And is that not scary? Being out in the middle of the ocean at night, it's just black, there's no lights, there's no land… there's nothing?"", ""MD: Again, there are points where I got concerned, but I don't think I ever had fear of being out there. Well, except that one time when I thought a whale went under the boat… to this day I still don't know whether it was a whale or my mind, but this thing was bigger than the boat, and I swear it went right under the boat…"", 'But you do get concerned at points. Something that helps when you\'re in those situations, is just to appreciate the magnitude of not only the opportunity, but the moment. I\'m in a boat and nobody is within hundreds and hundreds of miles of me, and what a special experience and opportunity that is. That\'s what fills my mind, rather than ""if I move 2ft to my left I\'m gonna drown because it\'s 15,000ft deep."" You can choose either perspective you want to take.', ""MEC: Tell me a little about the charities you work with - Hope for the Warriors, the Gary Sinise Foundation, LA Circle of Giving, and LEAP Foundation, as well as your own charity, Dawson's Peak."", ""MD: To start from the top down: Dawson's Peak is a fully registered 501c3; our mission is to inspire the discovery and pursuit of individual purpose. To get people to understand that we are all capable of living greater lives, and that it is important for us not only to identify, but to each develop our individual purpose… basically the unique gift that we can offer the world in a way that only we can offer it. I think that gets lost a lot - people fail to understand that you can impact this world in a way differently than I can, differently than someone else, and someone else… we all have a unique impact through the special gift that we all have. And the way that Dawson's Peak does it is, we create large scale global expeditions where we sponsor athletes, the athletes go out and undertake those expeditions, and viewers can watch them, and hopefully serve as points of inspiration, where the viewer can see them climb a mountain or row an ocean, and say I can find the mountain or the ocean in my life. If they can do that, I can apply that to my life."", ""On our first project, Seven for Soldiers, where I'm trying to set 7 world records - 100% of our net proceeds are going to two outside groups, as a way of putting our money where our mouth is, to show the kind of impact we want to have on others. 100% of net proceeds benefit the Gary Sinise Foundation and Hope for the Warriors, which are two of the highest Veteran ranked and rated charities in the country, and we are very proud to have them be a part of this."", 'I also sit on the board of LA Circle of Giving, they work directly with individual specific families that are in need; rather than having an organization that generally raises money and generally distributes money, they work with families on a one-off basis, understanding the needs of that particular family, and then raises the necessary funds or awareness or assets to address the issues that they are going through.And then the LEAP Foundation is a group that works through UCLA, that mentors young kids, and their development as individuals and professionals.', 'MEC: Not just where do you find the energy - where do you find the time? You must have excellent time management skills!', 'MD: I enjoy efficiency! I really do.', 'MEC: Any tips for us?', 'MD: It\'s what we spoke about earlier: when you find that ""have"" - It\'s gotta be that important to you. Look, before all this started, I was going out 4-5 nights a week, going to bars and restaurants and dinners and clubs and hanging out with friends and vacations. Since August 1, 2018, I think I\'ve gone on one vacation, and maybe three dinners. I don\'t hang out with friends, I don\'t see my family as much. The social life, the dating, all that stuff has taken a back seat to this. I\'m in bed at 10pm and up at 4, 5, or 6am and at it… it\'s just part of the game.', 'MEC: But obviously no regrets? You seem like a very happy person… you seem very content. Not just focused, but content.', 'MD: You see, I would say exactly that. I\'m not a happy person, by nature. It\'s just not how I\'m built.

Let's take a closer look at the top airlines for economy class."", ""Southwest is known for charging minimal fees, which can be a win if you're a traveler who books economy class airfare tickets. The airline doesn't charge change or cancellation fees as long as you cancel your flight at least 10 minutes before the scheduled departure."", 'Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards', 'Southwest also allows every flier to bring two checked bags for free. Extra bag fees can add up, especially when traveling with companions. These additional perks can provide value to travelers.', ""Here's one pro tip I'd like to share if you're working with a limited budget: Try to buy your airfare during one of Southwest's sales. The carrier runs sales several times a year. This strategic move could help you keep more money in your checking account."", 'Basic economy tickets are the most affordable economy tickets available.

Increased costs of essential materials further raise concerns for profit margins.While investments in smoke-free products come at the cost of margins, they have been driving revenues of tobacco companies, given consumers’ growing health consciousness. Pricing power has also been working well. These upsides keep Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO and British American Tobacco p.l.c. BTI well positioned despite the industry challenges.', 'About the Industry ', 'The Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products. Most products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.', '4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco Industry', 'Cigarette Volumes Under Pressure: The tobacco industry is grappling with challenges related to the inflationary environment, which has significantly influenced consumer spending habits.\xa0 Economic factors such as inflation, increased interest rates, and Adult Tobacco Consumers’ dynamics, including changing purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products, and shifts in disposable income, have affected cigarette sales volumes. Additionally, stringent government regulations on sales, marketing, and manufacturing, prompted by the health hazards of nicotine consumption, have further impacted volumes. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. As cigarette sales constitute a significant portion of revenues for tobacco industry companies, the decrease in sales volumes within this category raises concerns.Escalated Costs: Numerous industry participants have been affected by cost inflation. Global inflationary challenges linked to essential materials such as tobacco leaf, energy and labor costs have been concerns. Elevated expenses related to the research, development and marketplace activities of smoke-free products further present risks to profit margins.Growing Popularity of Smoke-Free Alternatives: Increasing awareness of health risks and stringent government regulations intended to curtail cigarette smoking have encouraged many consumers to switch to reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives. Promoted as having a less adverse impact on health due to their scientific composition and method of consumption, these products are gaining popularity. More consumers are turning to these alternatives as a way to quit smoking traditional cigarettes. Major players in the tobacco industry have been allocating resources to expand their presence in this category, including investing in innovations to make these products more user-friendly and energy-efficient. Companies have been experiencing significant revenue growth in the RRP or smoke-free product space. Philip Morris and British American Tobacco have been proactively working toward transitioning into predominantly smoke-free companies in the coming years. The continued popularity and resilience of these products are expected to drive positive outcomes for industry players amid ongoing business transformations.Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been leveraging the strong pricing influence of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Since smokers tend to be less responsive to price hikes due to their addiction, this approach is anticipated to continue benefiting companies within the tobacco sector. The prudent pricing of cigarettes has been supporting the revenues of players in the tobacco industry in the face of declining volumes.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects', 'The Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

Recently, it announced reinvestment plans for Houston’s iconic The Galleria, underscoring its strategy to enhance its property portfolio, catering to the ever-growing demand for luxury retail spaces.Texas' largest and one of the nation’s biggest shopping centers, The Galleria, spans more than 2.4 million square feet, drawing more than 30 million visitors annually. Besides being a retail hub, this grand shopping center serves as a significant tourist attraction, offering a blend of high-end stores, dining and entertainment options.Simon’s planned multimillion-dollar upgrades will commence this summer and are slated for completion by early 2025. The upgrades include both interior and exterior enhancements, with aesthetic elevations of the northward and eastward-facing valet entrances from Nordstrom through the Westheimer entrance.A number of The Galleria's interior and exterior entrances will be redeveloped to include sleek entryways, contemporary LED lighting and ceiling enhancements. The revamp also includes installing 155,000 square feet of new, modern flooring throughout the center. These renovations aim to provide a refined and welcoming ambiance for shoppers, reinforcing The Galleria’s status as a luxurious shopping destination.The Galleria’s appeal lies significantly in its extensive collection of luxury brands. In the past five years, several high-end retailers have expanded and enhanced their boutiques within the center. This included Gucci expanding to a two-story concept and FENDI and Saint Laurent doubling their retail footprints and showcasing new design prototypes. The Galleria also welcomed Dolce & Gabbana, AMIRI, Maria Tash, Prada, Dior and Alo Yoga, with more high-end retailers such as Etro and Frette on the way.These expansions reflect strong consumer demand for luxury goods and solidify The Galleria’s position as a premier luxury shopping destination in the Houston market.This latest investment marks the first major redevelopment since 2017, when Simon concluded extensive upgrades to The Galleria's luxury wing, including a reimagined Saks Fifth Avenue.Apart from luxury retail, The Galleria offers a diverse mix of more than 400 stores and 60 eateries, ranging from fine dining to fast casuals. It also includes two Westin hotels, three office towers, co-working spaces and other amenities, making it a dynamic mixed-use environment."", ""Simon Property has been restructuring its portfolio, aiming at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, over the past years, the company has been investing billions to transform its properties, focusing on creating value and driving footfall. Its commitment to enhancing The Galleria reflects a broader strategy of reinvesting in high-performing assets. This revitalization not only aims to boost foot traffic and sales but also to attract top-tier tenants, ensuring long-term value creation.Solid retail-real-estate demand for premium properties is likely to drive healthy demand for its properties, aiding leasing activity, occupancy levels and rent growth. Focus on supporting omnichannel retailing and developing mixed-use assets are encouraging. Also, accretive buyouts and redevelopment efforts augur well for long-term growth. A healthy balance sheet will likely aid growth endeavors, though growing e-commerce adoption and high interest rates remain concerns.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 21.1% in the past six months compared with the industry's upside of 4%."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Acadia Realty Trust AKR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The companies even achieved a market cap north of $500 billion. However, these firms have been unable to cope with existing demand and are facing delays in fulfilling orders amid continued supply constraints and product shortages.', 'Wall Street anticipates an even bigger market for obesity drugs. Per research conducted by Goldman Sachs, the obesity market in the United States is expected to reach $100 billion by the end of this decade. This is also evident from the fact that Lilly and Novo are not only investing heavily to optimize their production capacities but have also started evaluating multiple other novel obesity candidates in their pipeline.', 'Anticipating this rising demand, several biotech/pharma companies are developing their obesity drugs with the hope of gaining a small but lucrative share in this growing market. Here, we discuss four biotech/pharma stocks that we believe could break the duopoly in the obesity space in the long run.', 'Viking Therapeutics VKTX, a clinical-stage biotech, is evaluating both oral and subcutaneous formulations of its obesity drug,VK2735, in early-stage and mid-stage studies, respectively. This investigational drug has blockbuster potential, having demonstrated superior weight reduction capabilities in both clinical studies.', 'In February, Viking Therapeutics reported that the mid-stage study, which evaluated a subcutaneous formulation of VK2375, achieved its primary and all secondary endpoints with statistical significance. Patients treated with this formulation achieved a mean weight reduction of 14.7% after 13 weeks compared with 1.7% in the placebo group.', 'In March, Viking reported data from the early-stage study on the oral formulation of the drug, which demonstrated promising dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight after 28 days of daily dosing.', 'Viking Therapeutics intends to meet with the FDA to discuss the above results to determine the next steps in the candidate’s development.

Over 24 weeks, patients who received this once-weekly, subcutaneously-injected drug achieved a mean placebo-adjusted weight loss of 18.8%.

While all patients who received CT-388 achieved a weight loss of more than 5%, around 45% of patients lost more than 20% of their body weight. Treatment with the drug was also shown to be beneficial to type II diabetes (T2D) patients.', 'Roche is also evaluating CT-996 and CT-868 across separate early-stage studies.

And that has made the companies who make those drugs, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, hot investments over the past few years. ', ""But there could soon be many more options out there for patients. Given the potential for a weight-loss drug to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for a company, there's bound to be a lot of interest in the space, and many healthcare companies are vying to bring comparable products to market."", ""One particularly promising GLP-1 drug that investors should keep an eye out for is MariTide. Here's why it could put a serious dent in the future demand for Zepbound and Wegovy."", ""MariTide, also known as AMG 133, is a GLP-1 injectable treatment that pharmaceutical company Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) has been developing. The results have been incredibly encouraging, as it has been shown to reduce a person's body weight by up to 15%, which is comparable to Wegovy's results. Zepbound has helped people lose more than 20% in clinical trials."", 'But just the weight loss percentage may not be of the utmost importance to patients. With MariTide, doses were only administered on a monthly basis, which is unlike Wegovy and Zepbound, which require weekly injections. And in some cases, patients took MariTide even less frequently. By requiring fewer injections that could make it more attractive for patients, and it may end up costing less.', 'Another potentially game-changing advantage for the drug is that patients have also been keeping the weight off after they stopped taking MariTide. Gaining weight after stopping treatment has been one of the biggest problems for people taking other GLP-1 drugs.', 'Zepbound and Wegovy are already approved drugs for weight loss in the U.S. market. MariTide, however, is only in phase 2 trials. And the data the results were based on were from a phase 1 trial. As MariTide progresses into later trials, they will become larger, cover longer periods, and give investors more information about whether the drug is in fact the real deal.', ""Success in early-stage trials doesn't mean MariTide will obtain approval or that it will even end up progressing to phase 3. The results are promising, and it definitely makes it a drug worth keeping an eye on. But it would be premature to assume that MariTide will be a top product for Amgen just yet, or that approval is imminent. It could still take multiple years for the drug to progress through clinical trials successfully, gain approval (assuming that it does), and start generating revenue for Amgen."", ""Year to date, shares of Amgen are up a relatively modest 8%. While the healthcare stock has been climbing lately, thanks in part to the news relating to MariTide, it isn't taking off just yet. At 16 times its expected future profits (based on analyst estimates), Amgen is potentially a cheap stock to buy right now. And it may look like a downright steal if MariTide continues to demonstrate strong results in clinical trials."", ""At a modest valuation, Amgen could make for an intriguing investment right now. Even if MariTide doesn't end up obtaining approval, Amgen is still a top healthcare stock, and it pays a dividend, which yields 2.9%; there are multiple reasons to invest in it. It offers investors a safer way to invest in a potential GLP-1 drugmaker, rather than buying shares of a much smaller healthcare company with a less diverse and financially secure business. And its returns could be far greater than investing in Eli Lilly or Novo Nordisk, which are already among the most valuable healthcare stocks in the world."", 'Before you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amgen wasn’t one of them.

It is the tenth so-called “bispecific” antibody to gain FDA approval in cancer, and the first in small cell lung cancer.', 'The FDA approved Imdelltra more than three weeks ahead of its deadline, and based its decision on a trial showing the drug shrank tumors in 40% of patients who received it. Amgen will need to complete another study testing Imdelltra against another active treatment to confirm its benefit and place on the market.', 'Small cell lung cancer represents about 14% of all lung cancer cases, and hasn’t drawn as much research as the more common non-small cell disease. Until recently, chemotherapy has been the main form of treatment, and patients had a poor survival outlook.', 'As in many other areas of cancer care, however, immunotherapies have changed how the disease is treated. Tecentriq from Roche and Imfinzi from AstraZeneca gained approval in 2019 and 2020, respectively, to be used alongside chemotherapy in people newly diagnosed with the “extensive stage” form of the disease, in which cancer has spread beyond the primary site.', 'Amgen’s bispecific antibody targets a protein called delta-like ligand 3, which also was the aim of an AbbVie antibody-drug conjugate called rovalpituzumab tesirine that failed in testing.', 'Amgen’s bispecific approach follows the success of other dual-targeting antibodies in blood cancers, like Johnson & Johnson’s Tecvayli for multiple myeloma. Imdelltra engages the same CD3 protein on T cells.', 'Known scientifically as tarlatamab, Indelltra is only for patients once they progress following chemotherapy. On chemotherapy alone, patients can expect to live on average another 10 months, while the addition of Imfinzi added three more months and Tecentriq two more months in clinical trials.', 'Like other bispecific antibodies, Imdelltra is associated with a serious immune-related side effect called cytokine release syndrome, which in testing mostly occurred after the first and second doses. The FDA label instructs patients to stay within one hour of a medical center following the first doses to allow for monitoring, and also instructs doctors to interrupt or discontinue care in severe cases.', 'Imdelltra’s approval represents “a meaningful improvement over current options, and there is no approved standard of care,” William Blair analyst Matthew Phipps wrote in a note to clients. Phipps estimated Imdelltra sales will reach $842 million in 2028, based on disease prevalence and the drug’s price, which Amgen set at $31,500 for the first cycle and $30,000 for subsequent cycles.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

When a certain category of stocks, like big tech, outperforms the market in a big way, it's easy for a portfolio to suddenly become way more growth-focused than originally intended."", ""The simplest way to fix that is to sell a piece of a winning position and rebalance into something else. But that's not a good idea if an investment thesis is still strong. Therefore, a better solution is to deploy new savings toward safer pockets of the market. That way, you can let your winners run while also shifting the balance of your portfolio."", ""Knowing what is driving the market can help you make informed investment decisions. But jumping into whatever is working over the short term and out of what isn't working is an overly complicated strategy that can do more harm than good."", ""The Dow outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite can sometimes be a bearish signal that investors are getting defensive.

Mastercard's new Salesforce collaboration follows a February upgrade at the card network to add more gen AI technology to dispute resolution. Its rival Visa introduced a gen AI dispute-resolution tool of its own, also in February."", 'In tests, disputes and call center dispute volume has fallen between 20% and 40% when merchants and issuers leverage Consumer Clarity. Salesforce hopes the Mastercard deployment will deflect about a quarter of call-center queries.', '""Getting disputes wrong is a problem because people will stop using their card if they don\'t feel secure,"" said Guarav Mittal, CEO and executive vice president of Ethoca, a Mastercard-owned fraud detection service. ""For merchants one bad experience can cause a consumer to leave entirely."" ', ""New AI technology is a big part of Mastercard's quest to monetize non-payment sources. The use of gen AI with a large data set built over time can differentiate card networks from payment fintechs, Mittal argued."", ""Mastercard's Ethoca Alerts provide real-time notifications to merchants when a financial institution reports a chargeback. Salesforce connects merchant and payment information to back offices at the relevant card issuer. Payments data is fed into Salesforce's cloud, which manages customer relationship, security, and merchant and issuer services."", ""Salesforce and Mastercard plan to offer the dispute-resolution service to Salesforce's merchant and e-commerce clients, as well as card issuers."", '""There is less likelihood of a payment being rejected with this improved data,"" Mittal said. ""For a sample company that does $40 billion in yearly sales, for example, even a 1% improvement in payment approvals would be a big deal.""', 'Mastercard and Salesforce hope to address what Mastercard says is a growing payment dispute problem. The number of chargebacks is expected to reach 337 million annually by 2026, a 42% increase from 235 million in 2023, according to Ethoca research. E-commerce payment fraud stemming from consumers, or friendly fraud, has become the top form of e-commerce fraud, according to Cybersource, a Visa subsidiary, which reports 39% of merchants have been victimized by friendly fraud.', '""Banks and consumers can get a more efficient call center with gen AI,"" said Eran Agrios, senior vice president and general manager for financial services at Salesforce, adding that the technology includes AI copilots that staff can use to aid queries. ""We\'ll be able to open an [AI copilot] and say, \'tell me about this dispute\' and get trusted relevant responses in a moment,"" Agrios said. ""The AI copilots can also take action, something like offering provisional credit while a dispute gets resolved.""', ""Elsewhere in the payments industry, Klarna's gen AI initiative reached nearly 90% of its staff, the Swedish payment and buy now/pay later company announced this week."", 'Klarna, which did not provide comment by deadline, also reported that gen AI is handling more than 66% of customer service queries, with a 25% drop in repeat queries since the technology launched in January and a reduction of the average resolution time from 11 minutes to two minutes. Visa\'s dispute-management product uses technology from the software firm ServiceNow to add automation to the process that finds out who is responsible for fraud, whether a payment is an accidental purchase or an incorrect payment. Visa did not provide comments by deadline. ""With gen AI you can accelerate feedback and speed the delivery of transaction information to identify which payments may turn into fraud,"" Mittal said.', ""Fraud and customer service are a big part of the financial services industry's plans. Fifty-two percent of financial institutions are using or plan to use gen AI for customer service and fraud prevention, according to Arizent, American Banker's publisher, which surveyed 126 financial services industry leaders in January and February."", '""This is reflective of the fact that institutions want to harness new technologies to tackle their challenges impeding growth,"" Michael Moeser, senior content strategist at Arizent, wrote in a payments research report.', 'Gen AI is in the process of reinventing everything in the contact center, according to Max Ball, a principal analyst at Forrester.', '""Gen AI typically does a much better job summarizing calls than agents did, and the agents are free to move on to the next call,"" Ball said, adding that customer self-service is where the ""real value"" is.', 'The average labor cost for a call-center agent interaction is $5.50, according to Verint, which says an automated interaction costs between 25 and 50 cents.', '""The [return on investment] on self-service is huge here,"" Ball said.']"

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Medtronic had US$25.1b of debt in January 2024, down from US$28.1b, one year before. However, it does have US$8.32b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$16.8b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Medtronic had liabilities of US$9.79b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$29.0b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$8.32b in cash and US$5.97b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$24.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Medtronic has a huge market capitalization of US$113.7b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Medtronic's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.9 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 46.4 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. We saw Medtronic grow its EBIT by 7.4% in the last twelve months. Whilst that hardly knocks our socks off it is a positive when it comes to debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Medtronic's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Medtronic recorded free cash flow worth 78% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate."", ""The good news is that Medtronic's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. It's also worth noting that Medtronic is in the Medical Equipment industry, which is often considered to be quite defensive. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Medtronic's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Medtronic insiders have bought shares recently. If you would too, then you're in luck, since today we're sharing our list of reported insider transactions for free."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

By beginning with this highly reliable pacing lead and building a larger lead suitable for defibrillation therapy, the Medtronic OmniaSecure lead is the world's smallest transvenous defibrillation lead (4.7 French, equivalent to the diameter of graphite in a wooden pencil)."", 'LEADR Primary Results: EffectivenessDefibrillation testing conducted at device implantation in 119 patients was successful in 97.5% of cases. The study exceeded the prespecified efficacy goal of 88%.', 'LEADR Primary Results: Safety At six months, 97.1% (Kaplan-Meier estimate) of 657 patients with an implant attempt were free from lead-related major complications such as hospitalization, lead fracture, system revision, or death. The study exceeded the prespecified safety performance goal of 90%. There were no lead-related major complications observed between six and 12 months (average follow up of 12.7±4.8 months).', '""The positive results from the LEADR Pivotal trial are a significant advancement for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death who rely on ICDs to deliver life-saving therapy in the event of a dangerous heart rhythm,"" said George H. Crossley, M.D., Director of the Electrophysiology Lab and Cardiac Research Enterprise, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn., and LEADR Pivotal trial steering committee chair. ""Patients with defibrillators are living longer today, and we need to strive for reliable therapy for the lifetime of the patient. This innovative, low-profile defibrillation lead leverages a highly reliable pacing lead design to help achieve this goal, and the unique catheter-based method of implantation helps the physician place the lead in the optimal position for the patient.""', 'The LEADR Pivotal trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, non-randomized, global clinical study that assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic OmniaSecure defibrillation lead when placed at traditional locations in the right ventricle to achieve defibrillation, sensing, pacing and cardioversion in patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. The study enrolled 675 patients at 45 sites in 17 countries in\xa0North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.', 'Secondary and Ancillary Results: ReliabilityThe lead demonstrated reliable performance with zero (0) study lead fractures through an average follow up of 12.7±4.8 months. Medtronic developed and validated an in-vitro model that accurately predicts lead reliability out to 10 years,2 and then applied that model within the study to predict a fracture-free survival of 99.9% at two years for the investigational OmniaSecure lead. The lead also demonstrated a 97.9% implant success rate, and stable electricals (R-wave, pacing capture threshold, and pacing impedance) through 12 months.', 'Nearly 12% of patients in the study received appropriate therapy (shock, or anti-tachycardia pacing [ATP]) for dangerously fast ventricular arrhythmias by 14.0±5.0 months. ATP terminated 74.9% of episodes, preventing a shock in 49 patients. ', 'Medtronic plans to present additional reliability model results from the LEADR study in the coming months.', '""For 75 years, Medtronic has innovated to bring better life-saving technologies to the patients who need them,"" said\xa0Alan Cheng, M.D., chief medical officer of the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""Given our history in working with health care providers to design technology for patients with arrhythmias, we applied learnings from our deep experience with both transvenous defibrillation and pacing leads to create the novel OmniaSecure lead, a catheter-delivered lead that can be placed in the desired location. The LEADR study results are an encouraging step forward in achieving the goal of an even more reliable defibrillation lead for patients.""', 'In addition to the LEADR results presented at Heart Rhythm 2024, Medtronic recently initiated the LEADR LBBAP study (Lead Evaluation for Defibrillation and Reliability in Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing), which is assessing the safety and efficacy of the investigational OmniaSecure defibrillation lead when placed at the Left Bundle Branch Area in patients eligible for an ICD or Left Bundle Branch-Optimized Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (LOT-CRT). Placing the defibrillation lead in the left bundle branch area is being evaluated as an alternative to right ventricular stimulation for sensing, pacing, cardioversion and defibrillation. First implants were recently conducted by Muhammad Afzal, M.D., MBBS, principal investigator at The Ohio State Medical Center Wexner Medical Center, and John Zakaib, M.D., principal investigator at Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation.', 'About MedtronicBold thinking.

This is significant since many tech stocks tend to eschew dividends in favor of reinvesting for growth. It also confirms an impulse to offer payouts once they reach maturity."", ""Admittedly, Alphabet's dividend return of 0.5% is too small for it to attract the attention of income investors. Nonetheless, some tech stocks have begun to offer cash returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500's 1.3% average. With a continuous commitment to innovation, income investors should take notice of the potentially lucrative and growing payouts in these three stocks."", 'As one of the first tech companies to reach maturity, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) offered dividends to investors for decades. In April, it announced it would hike its payout to $6.68 per share annually. While that was an increase of just 0.6%, it marks the 29th consecutive year the dividend has increased.', 'Also, with a dividend yield of 4%, it has arguably become the dividend stock of the cloud. Arvind Krishna drove the 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, which placed IBM on the path to becoming a full-fledged cloud company.', 'That role in the cloud has also made it a player in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. This includes its team of consultants, IBM Research, and IBM watsonx. Watsonx is a business application that includes tools for model creation, storage, and AI governance.', ""Additionally, the company's stock has risen since Krishna became CEO in April 2020, a dramatic turnaround for a stock that lost value in most of the 2010s."", 'While one cannot describe IBM as a ""growth stock,"" the revenue declines have largely reversed under Krishna\'s leadership, and profits have increased.', 'Moreover, in the first quarter of 2024, the $12 billion in free cash flow for the trailing 12 months far exceeded the $6 billion in dividend cost during that time. This makes it likely that IBM will not only keep its payout, but also increase it on an annual basis.', 'Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI) plays a largely unseen but critical role in the wireless industry. It specializes in ""vertical real estate,"" owning many of the towers that support the United States\' wireless infrastructure.', 'As a real estate investment trust (REIT), it pays at least 90% of its net income in dividends in exchange for an income tax exemption on its operational profits.', 'To that end, shareholders earn $6.26 per share annually on the payout, a 6% cash return. Although Crown Castle has not increased the dividend since late 2022, the yearly payout has risen every year since it initiated the dividend in 2014.', 'Admittedly, Crown Castle faces some uncertainty, including a recent CEO change. Steven Moskowitz took over as CEO after former CEO Jay Brown retired in January. Still, even his 25 years of industry experience does not guarantee his success as a leader.', 'Moreover, revenue declines occurred as some Sprint contracts continue to get canceled due to its takeover by T-Mobile US.', 'Despite challenges, funding the dividend has not been an issue. Over the trailing 12 months, the dividend cost the company about $2.7 billion. This is significantly below the $3.2 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) income that funds the payout. That increases the likelihood that it will hike the payout this year and maintain its streak of annual dividend increases.', ""Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is credited with building the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, and its hardware and software solutions continue to support the world's technology infrastructure."", 'While it has become a slower-growth stock in recent years, it evolved into a notable dividend play. Its $1.60 per share in annual dividends yields about 3.2%. Even though the payout increased by less than 3% last year, it has risen every year since Cisco initiated the dividend in 2011.', 'Despite its dividend, the stock never recovered from the dot-com bust of the early 2000s as its switching and router business fell victim to falling demand and competition. More recently, it has become more of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock and recently acquired Splunk to increase its presence in cybersecurity. Still, it remains a mature, slower-growth business.', 'Despite its slowdown, Cisco generated nearly $14 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This covered about $6.3 billion in dividend costs, increasing the likelihood that the payout hikes will continue.

That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$131). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.

I'm going to start today's call with a quick review of our quarter and fiscal year and hand it over to Rob for some detailed color on the numbers. And then I'll finish with high-level thoughts on the industry and our fiscal 2025 outlook. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a strong finish to what was a historic year for RBC. Net sales came in at a higher end of our quarterly guidance range at $413.7 million, delivering roughly 5% of year-over-year growth, capping out a strong fiscal 2024 with revenues of $1.56 billion, delivering growth of about 6.2% year-over-year. 2024 was another year where 70% of our revenues were sole, single or primary sourced. That's a key component of our business profile and over half of our revenues continue to be from the maintenance and repair related side of the market. These offer attractive margins and noncyclical growth and obviously, a continually growing installed base. In the Aerospace and Defense segment, we reached an important milestone with fiscal 2024 sales surpassing their pre-COVID peak coming in at $519 million with a year-over-year growth of 20.7%. We expect more growth to come in fiscal '25 and beyond, but more on that later. With the segment -- within the segment, Commercial Aerospace was up 12.0% year-over-year in the quarter and 20.3% for the full fiscal year, with defense revenues up 29% in the quarter and 21.6% for the full year. Additionally, growth in A&D was fairly balanced through the year with distribution and aftermarket sales up 23.4% and OEM sales up 20%. On the industrial side, trends remained flattish with fourth quarter sales down 0.4% and full year sales up 0.2%. Broadly speaking, aftermarket sales remained stronger than OEM in both periods and end markets continue to be mixed with some growing and others down. During the quarter, we saw strength in power generation, waste and water management, while weakness was seen in multi-industry aggregate, cement and oil and gas. Delivering strong organic growth relative to our peers is a key part of RBC's playbook. And in fiscal 2024, that was no exception. Adjusted gross margins for the quarter came in at $178.3 million or 43.1% of sales, an expansion of 90 basis points over fiscal 4Q '23. And for the full year, we came in at $670.5 million or 43.0% of sales, an expansion of 180 basis points versus fiscal 2023 and a new all-time record for RBC. Our success here is driven by multiple factors. With ongoing synergies from the Dodge acquisition being the biggest contributor, coupled with improving utilization of our aerospace asset base and an ongoing pursuit of growth in higher-margin end markets. For comparison, our adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales for the third quarter of '22 and the first quarter following Dodge acquisition was 37.6% compared to 43.1% exiting fiscal 2024. That's a 550 basis point expansion on the gross margin line. At the time of the acquisition, we said we were targeting $75 million to $100 million of synergies over 5 years. We estimate that we have achieved somewhere between $70 million and $80 million in just over 2 years since the closing with more to come. And you can add, we have already repaid $625 million of term loan that was taken to make the acquisition. The Dodge transaction and what we've accomplished with (inaudible) Sargent acquisitions before that has been absolutely transformative for RBC. Over the past 5 years, net sales have gone from roughly $700 million to over $1.56 billion, growing at a 17.3% CAGR. And even more impressive is EBITDA, which has grown 19.8% CAGR and free cash flow, which is compounded at an amazing 29.2% CAGR over the past 5 years. I'd like to use this opportunity to express how proud I am of the team for delivering this kind of performance, along with yet another year of strong operating results in fiscal 2024 and for creating much of our own success with company-specific rolls and margin-focused initiatives. We have a lot to be proud of and what's been accomplished. And as always, we will be aiming a little higher in the upcoming year. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more details on the financial results."", 'Robert M. Sullivan', ""Thank you, Mike. Dr. Hartnett indicated fiscal 2024 was another year of strong organic growth in Aerospace, continued growth over market industrial business. Total sales growth of 4.9% in the quarter, 6.2% in the full year was surpassed by adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.4% in the quarter and 11.1% in the year, and by free cash flow growth of 18.4% in the quarter and 35.1% for the full year. This was enabled in part by solid progress on gross margin expansion with fourth quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales coming in at 43.1%, an expansion of roughly 90 basis points year-over-year. and the full year coming in at 43%, an increase of roughly 180 basis points. Strength in the gross margin line was derived from the Dodge synergies, increased utilization of our aerospace assets and our ongoing pursuit of higher margin mix. We leverage the healthy operating environment to make additional investments in SG&A aimed at positioning the business for continued growth. This includes investments in our IT infrastructure and our overall headcount, including sales force and back office personnel. That should enable the company to be able to secure and process higher volumes of our fiscal '25 and beyond. Even with the SG&A investments, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded with the fiscal fourth quarter coming in at 31.4%, an expansion of roughly 70 basis points year-over-year. And fiscal '24 coming in at an all-time record of 30.9%, an expansion of nearly 140 basis points. This is the first time our full year adjusted EBITDA margin crossed the 30% mark. And based on what we see for fiscal '25 and beyond, should serve as a base for additional expansion. In terms of EPS, there seems to be a bit of confusion this morning on tax in the quarter. Although our effective GAAP tax rate was 16.8% for Q4, the effective tax rate for our adjusted net income and adjusted EPS is 21.2%. This is reflected in the reconciliation within the press release. I call this out because it's important to note that the strength of our performance in Q4 was primarily driven by our operating performance. Free cash flow also outgrew the top line with $69.9 million generated in the quarter, delivering growth of 18.4% year-over-year and $241.5 million for the full year, representing 35.1% of year-over-year growth in free cash flow conversion of 115%. We used that free cash flow to continue to reduce debt from the Dodge acquisition, paying down $225 million on the term loan, coming in at the high end of our internal target for the year. This brings total net debt to $1.1 billion and net leverage 2.3x on a trailing basis. One item that you will want to take into account for your models (inaudible) convertible preferred stock expected to automatically convert on October 15, 2024. Using Q4 results as an approximation, the net impact of this conversion is expected to be slightly accretive to EPS, assuming conversion at the current share price. It will be meaningfully accretive, however, to free cash flow as the conversion will remove the cash dividend payment, reducing our future total cash outlays by approximately $23 million on an annualized basis. This is roughly 9.5% of fiscal 2024 total cash flow. Importantly, the removal of this cash can further accelerate the pace at which we are reducing the term loan. Altogether, the combination of healthy growth, margin expansion, solid cash generation and continued debt reduction capped off a strong fiscal 2024 and leaves the company well positioned heading into fiscal '25 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike for some closing thoughts."", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Okay. Thank you, Rob. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I wanted to spend some time on our outlook and how we're thinking about fiscal '25. To start, we are guiding first fiscal quarter net sales to $415 million to $420 million, representing year-over-year growth of 7.2% to 8.5%. This outlook largely reflects an environment that's similar to the past quarter, where demand in A&D is strong and industrial end markets are uneven, with some markets stronger and others softer, and overall industrial demand supported more by aftermarket sales than OEM. In terms of the full year, our outlook for commercial aerospace remains positive. Passenger miles traveled are back above pre-pandemic levels and continue to grow, driving plane utilization levels up and retirements down. New plane demand remains robust and continues to be throttled by supply chain shortages. As I've said before, the only constraint in commercial aerospace right now is not demand, but it's supply. On the OEM side, I'm sure many of you have been following the headlines and build rates at Boeing lately. Over the long term, I'm confident that Boeing will successfully navigate the current challenges it's facing and emerge stronger by the end of 2024. We believe that headwind, however, can be mitigated in the short term by stronger-than-expected requirements from other markets, including international airframe producers, space, defense and the aftermarket. As for RBC, we fully expect Boeing requirements to rebound by mid-Q3, remembering our products are needed approximately 6 months before airplane is assembled and industry lead times are typically 50 to 60 weeks for our products, depending upon material composition. Altogether, this points to an A&D revenue expected to be up low double digits in fiscal '25 on top of fiscal '24's record base. It will likely be back end-loaded. I think that's probably obvious. On the industrial side, we believe some tough comps we've seen in (inaudible) of the OEM business should start to abate as we progress through the year and aftermarket should continue to grow. What's important here is the growth over market. We believe the combination of our ongoing organic sales initiatives, coupled with our Dodge revenue synergies should continue to grow growth and our target of 2x GDP is still our target for FY '25. In terms of gross margin, I mentioned earlier, we made tremendous amount of progress in fiscal '24 and are well ahead of schedule on the Dodge synergies. Going forward, we expect higher mix of Dodge synergies to be derived from revenue growth as we continue to work to integrate the sales effort and drive new product development. With that in mind, we expect 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion in fiscal '25 driven by a combination of moderating Dodge tailwinds, ongoing absorption of our aerospace capacity and higher-margin new products being introduced to the market. Altogether, this paints a picture of another year of strong free cash flow generation, setting the stage for term loan reduction of another $275 million to $300 million, leaving us on track for our 5-year goal of fully repaying the debt generated from the Dodge acquisition. Our current net leverage is 2.3x on a trailing basis, and even lower on a forward basis, and that's before the $275 million to $300 million of further debt reduction plan for fiscal '25. This leaves us well positioned to more seriously evaluate M&A opportunities, and the team has been active in growing that pipeline. We expect at our current rate to be well under 2x EBITDA by the end of FY '25. Our (inaudible) here is to manage the company towards a balanced mix of aerospace and defense and industrial end market exposure over the long term. To conclude, fiscal 2024 was a record year for RBC. We delivered another year of solid growth. It was fully further mitigated by margin expansion or magnified by margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion. We are ahead of schedule on our Dodge synergies, and we are on track for our deleveraging and return to acquisitive growth. We look forward to fiscal '25 and we expect more of the same. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley."", 'Kristine Liwag', ""Mike, you touched on the Dodge revenue synergies in your prepared commentary. Can you provide more color on how that strategy is going? How's the integration of your 2 sales team have been progressing, I think, from what you recall Dodge has something like 10x the salespeople as legacy RBC Bearings. I'm not sure if that's still the case today. But how would this be implemented? And when you start measuring results, what kind of revenue synergy target do you think you can extract from this?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', 'I guess my 2x GDP growth was just too simple, Kristine?', 'Kristine Liwag', 'Well, Mike, 2x GDP growth for legacy RBC Bearings had historically been your target. So I was thinking that our revenue synergy from the deal would be incremental.', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. Well, I think there's good revenue synergy here for a number of -- there's a lot in the mix right now in terms of revenue synergy options that are being developed. And part of that mix is accessing more of the world market for Dodge. And obviously, RBC will ride on Dodge's coattails. And we're particularly focused on Europe and India and Mexico and Canada, and we see opportunities in all those areas for Dodge in '25 and if there's opportunities for Dodge, as I said, RBC should follow right through on the coattails. So that's -- those are pretty active initiatives that we have underway currently focused on these different foreign countries based upon their markets and what we do in these markets and what we can offer to these markets and how we can better develop jointly between Dodge and RBC, our market access. If we take India as an example, India, we have a great amount of infrastructure in India that allows us to have things manufactured there, to move things around the country, to import and export, which requires a certain infrastructure that has some sophistication to it. But at the same time, we see our -- many of our aerospace customers moving to India for economic reasons and it allows us better access through the Dodge sales force to the Indian aerospace customer base, and we expect to grow that customer base from somewhere less than $10 million a year today to certainly in the $30 million to $40 million per year in the next few years. It's very meaningful. So -- and that's just one example of maybe in aerospace and industrial synergy ongoing based upon the support created by the Dodge infrastructure."", 'Kristine Liwag', ""Great. And if I could ask a second question maybe on cost. When you've talked about like the footprint of Dodge manufacturing, you've talked about in the past how it's still mostly U.S.-based but there's an opportunity to move some to low-cost countries while keeping the higher value things in the U.S. Can you give any progress in terms of where you are in terms of that initiative? And when everything is completed as you've planned in the next 12 or 24 months, how much more margin do you think you can get from a lower cost structure?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. Well, we just completed building a plant in Tecate, Mexico for Dodge basically. And it's about 100,000 square feet. And it allows us to move some of Dodge's U.S. manufacturing into Mexico and free up some of the floor space in some of the Dodge plants for product expansion because they are constrained in the Dodge plants based upon floor space and based upon their supply chain. So we're -- our plan is to -- and actually, it's more than a plan now. We've capitalized it and we have things moving around. And if you're on Interstate 10 this weekend, you can watch our trucks go by. But we expect that's going to allow us to expand some of Dodge's product offering in terms of volume that they were unable to achieve in the past. So that's going to not only fund growth, but also move existing product into a low-cost country. And so that's sort of the first step of the effort. And obviously, you don't build a 100,000 square foot plant overnight. So this has been in the planning for the last 18 months. And we'll be in production in Tecate with the first round of products by July."", 'Kristine Liwag', ""Great. Well, I'll keep an eye out for RBC Trucks (inaudible) Interstate 10."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global.', 'Peter John Skibitski', 'Let me start -- and I thought one of the things that stood out was the backlog growth sequentially and year-over-year, it is really nice to see that. Was that what we should think mostly commercial aerospace, longer-term commercial aerospace orders coming in?', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Well, Aerospace and Marine, I mean that's probably heavily Aerospace and Marine. If there's some of that is industrial, it's probably 80-20 kind of a thing. Obviously, very little of Dodge's backlog is represented there. It's just -- it's not their business model. They -- what's ordered by customers for Dodge is usually shipped within the same day or within 2 or 3 days depending upon the product. So it never gets a chance to hit backlog. So that's 50% of our sales."", 'Peter John Skibitski', ""Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just your guidance for the first quarter, that would be a reacceleration of sales, right? You're kind of in that 4% to 6% range the last 3 quarters. Now you're talking close to 8%. I imagine the backlog doesn't hurt with regard to visibility there. But can you talk to us about what you're seeing in this first quarter versus the prior 3 quarters to kind of lead you to believe that sales are going to reaccelerate?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Well, we're seeing great bookings. There's particularly in A&D. I mean, it's very good. The -- I don't think the Boeing 737 build-out, the step down in their production rate is reflected in that quarter. I think it's going to be reflected in the second quarter but it isn't reflected in the first quarter at all."", 'Peter John Skibitski', ""Okay. Yes, that's helpful. That was a little confusing. Because yes, so I was going to ask you in terms of the changes to Boeing's master schedule and how it's impacting you. And I know they tried to keep a lot of suppliers at a roughly 30 a month rate, I think, (inaudible) but it sounds like maybe you guys are going to go below that for a quarter or 2 and then rise back up? Is that the way to think about it?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Well, the way I think about it is if you look at Boeing's production rate now and where they have to be, and of course, 38 ships per month is sort of the magic number, right? And they're talking about 20, 25 ships a month right now, maybe 30. So by next April, we're certainly expecting them to be healthy enough to be assembling 38 ships a month. And given that, that means for our product, we have to produce it. We have to ship it in October. And if we have to ship it in October, we have to start making it in July. So we're not going to -- we're going to be making it, probably not shipping it at a great rate, probably a reduced rate based upon -- relative to the first quarter, but I suspect the year will step up after our second quarter, which is September ending, right? I suspect every quarter now will step up to match their assembly rate beginning in April. Maybe they pull that in. But I think they know it has to be done. Everything is in their wheelhouse. There's no new rockets have to be invented. It's all basic execution and they are smart, qualified, capable people, they'll get this done."", 'Peter John Skibitski', ""Yes. Yes. I appreciate it. Last one for me. Defense growth was pretty incredible this year. Is that mostly marine, the submarines or anything else driving that? And then I just got the feel that maybe you're expecting another potentially -- I can't remember if (inaudible) double-digit growth in defense as well as commercial, but it sounds like the strength is going to continue."", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. Defense is going to continue. Right now, for certain, we're constrained by being able to produce enough defense products overall. And so we're working hard to bring up our rates. And so that's dependent upon labor, material availability, supply chain and other qualifications. So we're doing a great job of bringing up certain rates in the sort of the mid-teens kind of a rate year-to-year, sometimes a little bit more than that. And in some areas, we have to continue that for the next 3 or 4 years to get to the -- to get balanced with demand. So some of our defense, and that's particularly in the marine area. It's very strong. Other areas like, obviously, with what's going on in Ukraine. And now everybody wants all the foreign countries want to join Strike Fighter. So that's an important platform for us. So we're going to -- we're seeing more demand coming from Lockheed on those kinds of programs, the long-range bomber is active and demanding, and that's -- we're in the middle of that program. So yes, marine and airframe are really, really good for us. Guided munitions is another area that's extremely strong, whether it's ground to ground like that HIMARS system or it's shoulder mounted or it's a ballistic interceptor, we're on all those programs. And right now, there's a lot of replacement demand for Ukraine, and there's also demand to fortify U.S. arsenals. So I don't see that ending anytime soon. Maybe the Ukraine thing gets solved in the intermediate term. In the longer term, these U.S. arsenals were not deep enough. Everybody recognizes that, including the Chinese. That's why they're building out their arsenals. They're not going to do anything with Taiwan until their arsenals are built up the way they feel comfortable. So this is going to -- this is a long-term cycle event."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Robert Stephen Barger', 'Mike, as you talked about accessing more world markets for Dodge, is that all organic channel development? Or would you think about geographic acquisitions to accelerate that process?', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. We would think of both. I mean the -- but it's organic. I think it's primarily organic. If there was an acquisition that would accelerate the process, we'd consider it, but it's -- right now, it's pretty much using the assets that we already have more effectively and sort of building out the teams. It's a -- what has to be done there is very achievable, very achievable. And so it's a matter of paying attention to what's going on in Europe, spending more time with the foreign nationals at these various sites and making sure that they're well integrated with the RBC and Dodge missions. And so before we acquired Dodge, Dodge really didn't have access to these markets. They had access through ABB, their previous owner and ABB sort of didn't pay a great amount of attention to the mechanical side of their world. And so these languished and atrophied. And now we're pleasantly surprised that we have these footprints in active and productive areas of the world that we can spool up. And so we're in the process of spooling them up."", 'Robert Stephen Barger', ""And when you talk about -- I think you said Europe, India, Mexico, Canada, as you start to make a more directed push in that direction, are you competing against other global bearings manufacturers? Or is it more against locals? And I'm just trying to get a sense for what the market share opportunity is as you do focus in that direction?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. Well, it's -- it's the global bearing manufacturers if it's bearings. It's sort of the global gearbox manufacturers if it's gearbox. It's -- in a lot of cases, for aerospace and defense, it's particularly aerospace. It's a matter of following your customer to these remote sites and being able to service the requirements effectively. And so if you have the footprint to follow him and to service him, you're well ahead of anybody else."", 'Robert Stephen Barger', ""Yes. Got it. And then given all the funding visibility out there from the government for big projects, it's interesting that aggregates and cement are weak. Is this a destock? Or what are your customers telling you? And how do you think that unfolds for the back half of the calendar year?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Well, I think you know as much about that as I do, Steve. The aggregate and cement business is pretty much correlated almost perfectly with housing starts. So when housing starts are up, that business is very strong. And when housing starts are not up, that business is not so strong. So in housing starts, it's all about mortgage rates, right? So yes, I mean, it's -- when you read the research on Vulcan or Martin Marietta or the people that are in this world and the investment analysts correlate housing starts with demand for their business volumes, it's amazingly correlated. I mean it's like in our square (inaudible) one-on-one. So yes, so we look at housing starts. I don't think the Infrastructure Bill has really impacted anything at this point. I mean there's people that talk about it here and there, but it has not had any macro influence to the state that I can put my finger on."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', 'Question, not to nitpick. I know you just talked about the aggregates, but I think the prior view for fourth quarter was for industrial to maybe grow year-over-year a few points. It obviously came up a little bit light. Was it -- did the aggregates and cement, I know in the earlier prepared commentary you gave some of that end market with power gen waste. Did anything turn unexpectedly weak? Was it just that aggregate? I think you flagged oil and gas as being a bit weaker.', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Well, I think, first of all, what we did -- one of the things we didn't talk about was last year, we had -- Dodge did have backlog and that backlog was supply chain-driven. And so last year's fourth quarter, that backlog sort of supercharged the sales number as it was liberated."", 'Robert M. Sullivan', 'That was about a $10 million impact.', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Okay. So by about $10 million. That was the difference. So this year, supply chain is normalized. They don't have these kinds of backlogs anymore. And so it's not -- it's a hard comp. It's a hard comp."", 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', ""Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. And then just back on to '25. I want to make sure I heard it. Did you say low double-digit growth for Aero and Defense combined? And is there an expected parse out between commercial air and defense in that view?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""There's no parse out, but yes, it's combined. And we're just trying to figure out this Boeing thing and we had all of our plans around a different build rate for the ships. And so now we're reevaluating those plans and determining what we should bring in, in terms of additional business to offset any of the losses. And so that's sort of ongoing, yes. It's not going to be a normal year in terms of assuming Boeing gets their problems solved and gets to where they need to be like in the upper 50s in terms of 737 rates per year. I mean they got a 10-year backlog on this stuff. So they (inaudible) so they got to get this problem behind them. So assuming they get into that kind of a (inaudible) again. And I don't think they have a choice. They have to get into that. They have to get this behind them. We'll be back up into the high teens again."", 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', ""Yes. Okay. And then just maybe on that as well. I mean you talked about 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion with that ongoing absorption in Aero. Is that kind of taken into your commentary there? Should we expect the margin expansion being a little bit more back-end loaded in '25 as you kind of get clarity from Boeing?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', 'Yes.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', 'Okay. And then that -- that would imply maybe a really strong fourth quarter, especially as the $5.8 million of (inaudible) drop off. So just from a modeling, I mean, is that kind of how we should think about the year?', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""You're on the right track there."", 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', ""Okay. Very good. Last one I had. Any -- it sounds like leverage is going to come down. Any big appetite for more M&A out there? I mean Dodge has seemingly been a home run and is still driving value creation. So what's the appetite for another deal?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', 'Well, the appetite is good. But the appetite is picky.', 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.', 'Vivek Srivastava', 'This is Vivek Srivastava on for Joe. My first question is just on revenue seasonality. It looks like at this time, your first quarter where you would be better than where fourth quarter ended. As you think about gross profit and EBIT dollars, should that be sequentially better also on higher sales? Or is there something else we should keep in mind?', 'Robert M. Sullivan', ""I think as Mike just kind of spoke to regarding margin, we think that the overall margin expansion we discussed is really back-loaded. It's lumpy throughout the year. We'll continue to invest in a bit of SG&A in fiscal '25. So we're expecting continued strong performance."", 'Vivek Srivastava', 'Understood. And just a high-level question. Your EBITDA margin this quarter at 31.4%, very impressive. Just as we think about the long term, what kind of margin target long term you have in mind and then outside of aero volume recovery and some broad synergies, is there anything like improvement in terms of the base business that would further impact margin expansion?', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. I mean it's -- there's no end. Yes, I think there's still -- it's -- how can I say that? It's really one by one kind of a project in terms of manufacturing technology and identifying (inaudible) where are your lower-margin performers. And what, if anything, does the world provide in terms of technology to reduce labor or improve material costs or reduce scrap that would accrue to better margin performance. And so we have active programs with all of our plants that we review every month. And we look at the (inaudible) and we look at what generates the revenue and what could be done to improve the operating performance of that particular line item and what the options -- manufacturing options might be for improvement that would benefit the overall margin of the line. So it's a matter of putting the time investment with all of the divisions one by one to create a program of improvement that accrues to a higher consolidated margin. And that's what RBC is really good at, and that's what we've done since I started the job 30 years ago. And we haven't -- we haven't stopped yet. So yes, I mean, come on over to one of our plants, and we'll show you how we do that."", 'Vivek Srivastava', 'That sounds great, yes. Just last question on free cash flow. How should we think about free cash flow in 2025 and from a working capital standpoint, maybe just talk about what improvements are you baking in for the upcoming year?', 'Robert M. Sullivan', ""Yes. So as Mike just referenced, ultimately, we're looking to delever by another $275 million to $300 million -- so we're going to have to generate some healthy free cash flow to do that. We're always targeting over 100% conversion on net income, 115% this year. So we'll continue to drive that. Within the working capital section, as we look to the long term, which is important to do, we always are strategically looking at our inventory levels, making sure that we're prepared to strike and deliver to our customers as needed. So there's potential for a little bit of investment in that side, especially in aerospace. We'll continue to manage the remainder of the working capital along the way."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Jordan Lyonnais of Bank of America.', 'Jordan J Lyonnais', 'Last quarter, you guys said on the 787, you were going to step up to 7 a month in April, and it would be an important shift. Are you still producing at or still planning to produce at 7 a month, like we saw Spirit cutting headcount and Boeing also just cut. So could you give any more color for the wide-bodies?', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. No, we're staying at 5 a month."", 'Jordan J Lyonnais', ""Okay. And then also, too, so for the (inaudible) how much, if there's still all of the production uncertainty, how much do you guys are looking at the guide of how much you can make up in terms of pricing or just defense accelerating to make up for the commercial side?"", 'Michael J. Hartnett', 'Well, I mean, in terms of mitigating how are we going to mitigate the shortfall there for Boeing for a while?', 'Jordan J Lyonnais', 'Yes, yes. just a derisking.', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Yes. I think we have a quarter or 2 of the Boeing effect. I think given a quarter or 2, I mean, the maximum impact on revenues if we didn't do any mitigation, it would be $20 million over 2 quarters. $10 million would be sort of the minimum if we did no mitigation over 2 quarters. So it's sort of an achievable number. And when I look at some of the markets that we've been servicing, I mean, particularly, we talked about how strong defense is and how much we can realign our schedules to bring some of that defense production into earlier quarters, which is what's happening right now for some of the mitigation. But on the other hand, a few years ago, we started working in space. And in '24, we shipped $20 million into the space world. And so our business on space products is accelerating. We see that getting to $40 million, and we see that probably getting to $30 million this year. So space is starting to become a significant component of our A&D sales. So that's part of the mitigation. Defense is part of the mitigation and increasing our spares sales is another part of the mitigation. So we have -- what we have maybe half a dozen significant divisions that are working on various mitigation techniques, products to offset any shortfall of the -- for the -- in the second quarter that we might see from the Boeing production reduction and I suspect they'll get a long way towards the goal."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Hartnett for closing comments.', 'Michael J. Hartnett', ""Okay. Well, thank you. Well, that completes our call for today, and I appreciate everybody participating and listening to our presentation. Obviously, we've delivered another year of solid growth and great cash flow conversion. And we look forward to talking to you again in July."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event.

let's take a quick check on where the majors ended up here because we did have the Dow closing above 40,000 up just about a third of 1%."", 'The S and P up marginally the NASDAQ down marginally.', ""Jared's got a close look now for us."", ""Yes, Julie, that should have been a record close for the Dow and we're looking at gains for the week."", ""If we can go to the Wi Fi Interactive, I will show you here's the NASDAQ down fractionally today."", ""So no record close there, but up 2% for the week and we'll take a look at the Dow as well."", 'There you go.', 'Finally got a close over 40,000 as you were saying, and we are pretty close to the highs of the week which were also the highs of day.', ""Now, let's take a look."", ""I want to take a look at the V first and then we'll get into some heat maps."", 'The VX now trade with an 11 handle.', 'You can see this is the lowest point in the year.', 'So that is a tail wind for equities.', 'But this is also the time to be buying protection.', ""You need to buy protection when you don't need it."", 'But here is the sector action for today.', 'Energy in the top spot up 1.4% followed by materials and also financials, discretionary health care communication services.', 'Round out the top row tech and Staples took a back seat today.', 'But for the week, here we go.', 'We got tech in the poll position up 3.1%.', 'In

ahead for investors is Ryan Kelly Hennessy funds Cio and portfolio manager along with RB capital markets, us economist Michael Reed.', 'Welcome by both of you to show.', ""Uh So Ryan maybe we'll start there dow closing record high above 40,000."", 'A big round number.', ""It's gonna get attention and headlines what's been driving this Ryan this market rally and do you see that momentum continuing?"", 'You know, thanks for having me on.', ""I think that uh obviously there's a lot of exuberance in the market right now."", 'Um 40,000 huge number.', ""We've never seen it before as far as a closing level."", 'Uh This is um for a few different reasons, obviously, uh the expected next move for the fed, even though it might be quite a ways out is to lower rates.', ""Also, we have um the idea and the worry of a slowdown in the economy or recession, that's all kind of behind us as well."", ""So you put those together and I think that we're setting ourselves up for still a pretty good year."", 'Uh From here forward Michael.', ""Um You're here with the sunset is the idea of a recession put to bed."", 'I mean, we talked to Bob Dole of Crossmark at the top of the show.', ""He's still worried about one before the end of the year."", 'What do you think?', 'Sure, thanks for having me.', ""Uh We don't see a recession ahead for the US economy."", 'Um We do see a lot of tail winds, especially in the consumer space.', ""Uh One thing we've talked a lot about is uh the rise in retirement assets, uh both uh portfolios um that are increasing in value and, and the sheer size of the baby boomer generation that's retiring and starting to draw down those assets, um that's showing up in the economy in terms of consumer spending."", ""So that's a really strong tail wind and Ryan back to you."", ""So you say you're looking for a pretty good year uh for the rest of 2024 here, Ryan, how do you wanna put money to work in this environment?"", 'What, what are you screening for?', 'Well, I think we stick to what we always do here.', 'Um You know, one of the spaces that we really like, um which has um lagged the rest of the market.', ""It's a little bit better valuation metrics than the broader market right now is the mid cap space."", 'Um We have always liked midcaps uh here at Hennessy.', ""Um But in this particular time, I think that um first of all these, this market move we've seen really since last October is more broad based."", ""So that's really good to see."", ""It's not just large cap tech or working from home stocks that we had three years ago."", ""Um it's much more broad based and in fact, this year already, uh while the overall market, the S and P is about 12% a lot of the sectors are about that same amount as well."", ""There's not really one major sector pushing the rest."", ""So the mid caps, we like them because they're big enough to matter."", ""They've gotten to a certain size already."", 'Uh They can still grow a lot organically because they uh they can still take market share or maybe move into other industries.', 'Uh And yet they are still important enough that a larger cap company could acquire them.', 'So you put those together along with a little bit better valuation right now than our overall market.', ""And I think mid caps are a pretty good place to look going forward, Michael kind of switching back to the economy here and talking about the different sort of parts of the economy, I guess if you're talking about corporate size, right?"", 'Although you probably think more about about consumer income tranches, right?', ""And, and how they're doing kind of walk us through your thinking on where the consumer is in those different tranches right now."", 'Sure.', 'And I think where some of the recession talk is coming in is when you look at the the lower income spectrum.', 'Um we are seeing things like credit card delinquencies, rising auto loan delinquencies are on the rise.', 'And those folks that do rely more on credit for their spending um are feeling that pinch of higher rates.', 'Um on the other hand, when we think about those higher income earners and especially retirees, um a lot of their income is being boosted by higher interest rates.', 'So, um interest income is something that is a bit of a tailwind um at the higher end of the spectrum.', ""But in neither case, I think what's important for the economy getting back to this concept of retirees, that's going to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate."", ""So even those folks who are feeling that pinch from inflation can be pretty confident that they're going to have a job over the course of the next year."", ""We don't really see the unemployment rate rising meaningfully above 4% through the end of this year."", 'You know, since you have talked a little bit about the retirees, I want to bring a sort of a provocative idea that Rick Rieder of Blackrock um talked about in an interview with Bloomberg recently where he said the answer is actually to bring interest rates down in order to bring inflation down.', ""And he reasoned that because so many people not just retirees, but lots of people are putting more money in fixed income because they're getting a high yield on that, then they have that money to spend."", ""And he argued if you cut the rate, then that money will come out of fixed income, people won't be earning as much on it does that if I'm, if I'm explaining it correctly, does that make sense to you?"", 'Yeah.', 'You know, I think, I think you have the right idea there.', 'Um, and that in a sense does make uh some sense in terms of where the, the pressure is uh for services spending.', 'Um where we look at the strength, we see it in categories where uh the 55 plus cohort tends to be overrepresented.', 'So things like dining out um you know, uh hotels, travels, uh and, and medical care uh is, is another big one for that particular uh segment.', 'So, um if you take away some of the spending power from kind of the higher end of the income spectrum, that would take some of the strength through DC in the the consumer Ryan back to you.', ""So, so you sound, you know, generally constructive on, on the market, Ryan and told us kind of how you're screening for names."", 'Can you give us some uh a couple of names Ryan that would be, you know, just kind of representative holdings in the fund right now.', 'Absolutely.', 'Um So in, in the Hennessy cornerstone midcap 30 fund, we look for companies that are um that, that uh are trading at a good valuation uh for companies that have some momentum behind them and companies that have earnings growth.', ""So the interesting part about this portfolio is that you'll find names that probably aren't talked about a lot and probably aren't in a whole lot of other portfolios."", 'Either we own.', 'Gap, Abercrombie and Fitch and guess uh we, we purchased all those last October, um Abercrombie for instance, is up 100 and 50% since that time.', 'Uh These are companies that were out of favor.', 'Uh They were trading at fine valuations when we look at them.', 'Uh but they had turned a corner and then they, because of various reasons.', 'Number one, the consumer stayed strong.', 'Uh The holiday season was excellent.', ""Uh They've done very well."", ""We've also owned or we own right now."", 'A couple of other names that um, they are HV AC system companies, they, they provide heating and cooling, uh Modine manufacturing as well as comfort systems.', 'Both those companies again fit our criteria.', 'We added them to the fund and they done pretty well.', ""So, you know, this fund is an interesting fund in that we're not buying the same kind of names that you might talk about or see a lot, but they're at good value as far as we see them."", ""And um, so far this year it's worked out pretty well and I, I'm curious, you know, because we talk about a lot of these names, maybe that are being affected by higher for longer interest rates."", ""Is that a, is that a risk when you're talking about?"", 'Especially something like H VAC, which maybe people are financing in some cases, right?', 'I is that a risk.', 'It, it, it can be a risk for, for, in particular, for these H VAC companies.', ""Interestingly, I think they're actually a tertiary type play on the A I uh on what's going on in A I, we have the A I companies, we have the uh um uh you know, the, the hardware and the networking companies that are also benefiting from the A I boom."", 'And then you have interestingly building companies and H VAC systems that are benefiting as well.', ""So there's some that going on."", ""Um but as far as overall interest rate risk in the portfolio, we don't really have as much um of exposure to that."", ""We don't really have many financials."", ""Um you know, utilities that are more cyclical, we don't really own those as much."", ""So they don't really kind of make it into the portfolio in general."", ""So this is more of an idiosyncratic type portfolio and you're not gonna see a lot of those macro trends affecting the individual companies quite as much."", ""And as we're talking about interest rates, Michael, I want to close it out with you and ask what you think is going to happen this year with rates."", 'Sure.', 'So we are looking for the fed to cut this year.', ""Importantly, we don't see them really being able to do so until December partly that's because of the election."", 'But also thinking about what happened with the last CP I report while April was a step in the right direction.', ""It doesn't provide that confidence that we're on a sustainable path lower."", 'Um So we really need to see that trend continue and, and see prints that are closer to 2/10 or even 1/10 on a month, over month basis.', 'Um That would allow the fed then to start their cutting process.', 'All right, Michael Ryan.', 'Thank you guys both for joining the show today.', 'Appreciate it.', 'Thanks for having me.', 'Thank you for having me.', 'Still to come.', 'Silver and gold prices higher.', ""Today, we're going to speak to a strategist about the latest moves in the commodity based on the other side."", 'Stay tuned.', 'More market domination over time coming right up.', 'Welcome back to market domination over time.', ""Jared Blier is standing by to get you up to speed on the action from today's session sponsored by Tasty Trade Jared."", 'Thank you, Josh.', 'Uh a little bit of red today from the NASDAQ.', ""But for the week, we are looking at gains across the board and I'll hit the NASDAQ here over the last five days."", 'You can see a gain of over 2% there.', ""And the Dow which finally closed over 40,000 Friday, that's a 1.24%."", ""And it was kind of a week where we saw a lot of the fringe parts of the market, a lot of parts of the market that haven't been doing well recently over the last few years really come back in a lot of ways."", ""Now, tech, I'm not going to put tech in that basket here are sectors, but tech was the best performing sector of the week followed by real estate and health care."", ""Here's industrials down here."", ""But what I want to show you is what's happened with some of our leader, Bitcoin."", 'Bitcoin came back up about 6 7% G BT C. Up 10% we have Chinese stocks.', 'We can see Alibaba up 10% this week.', 'Some of these others up 7 to 15% depending on where you look.', 'If you look at unprofitable tech, the disruption trade in the US.', 'Those are the arc innovation components.', 'We saw a lot of that.', 'Those coming back led by Tesla, the biggest here of 5.3%.', 'And uh if we take a look inside our meme stocks, well, we see a lot of green here but you might be surprised to learn who the leader was for the week, not a MC, not cost, not gamestop.', 'It was Tupperware.', 'Tupperware up 70%.', ""And that's simply because Gamestop and A MC and the like a lot of those stocks gave, gave back some of their gains for Monday and Tuesday throughout the week."", ""I'm going to close here on Crypto, Bitcoin never sleeps."", ""So we're going to be geared up for the weekend of watching crypto prices here, as I said up 6% over the week."", ""But the leader here, Solana up over 14% and here's chain link up 21% guys."", 'Thanks, Jared.', 'Well, while stocks are up four weeks in a row, one area of the market that is really shining, get it is metals, gold is up 1% on the day.', 'But taking a look at the other metals, silver and copper in particular are surging as well.', ""Joining us now, Bloomberg Intelligence, Senior commodities analyst, Mike Mike mcglone, excuse me, Mike, it's good to see you."", 'Thanks for being here.', 'I want to start with copper which has just been such a fascinating story.', ""As of late, there have been all kinds of sort of odd supply disruptions just for people haven't been following it as close closely walk us through what's been going on."", 'Hi Julie.', 'Well, the significance this week is pretty, pretty profound short covering in futures.', 'The CME trading contract that trade in New York, there was some decent short covering those front contracts.', 'It really pumped up the front contracts into a decent like most significant backward nation in about 10 years and pulled back, which is oftentimes a sign of highs and so that contract closed at an all time new high and made new highs.', ""But the C the LME contract that trades in London did not make new high, but it's catching up."", 'So for me right now, what I see is more shenanigans and futures.', 'The futures contracts is a percentage of open interest, manage money net positions, ie hedge funds are very long, about 30% of open interest.', ""So they're already on top of this trade, which is a bit of a headwind."", ""Now, the more macro there is, you know, decarbonization digitalization electrification, but there's and some supply issues out of South America and Panama."", ""But overall, I'm more worried for copper that its auto correlation tendencies will, will vary through."", 'It usually has a tendency that spike to go down.', ""And basically it was it right now it's just catching up to gold."", 'Gold has been the star performer in medals.', 'Uh Mike, I also want to get your take on silver which has had such a move here.', 'Is this, you know, is it a story, Mike about industrial demand or is it financial demand or is it both?', ""Well, the macro for silver is it's industrial, basically gold is the has demonetized silver."", ""Um But it, it's known as the devil's metal for a reason because it has a tendency to spike and then go right back down."", ""So right now it's the same price as it was for, I guess it's about at the highest level since 2013."", ""So it's 11 year high."", ""It's right now the way I see silver, it's stuck between gold and copper and it's catching up the gold and it's got copper in its back."", ""And there's potential rumors that, you know, we know China has been the biggest buyer of gold, not just Chinese Central Bank, but citizens."", 'There may be some hoarding of silver.', ""But the key thing I'm more worried about silver is that it might follow that path, that auto correlation in Athens in copper where it spikes and then goes back down in the macro."", ""The big picture though I'm very favorable in terms of commodities, most favorable than metals versus most other commodities."", 'So give us a little bit more detail there, Mike about then what you expect to happen next?', 'Do you expect that spike and to come back down in a copper or do you think that there will be a more sort of sustained action here?', ""Well, we'll start with the most enduring trend in commodities and that is gold out before most commodities."", ""I think that's accelerated."", ""I think it's going to continue."", ""And to me it's just a matter of time gold gets at $3000 an ounce."", ""I don't know when."", ""Now it's got very good support now, below the market, around $2200 and ETF outflows have been significant at some point."", 'Those are flip higher.', ""I think that's going to take a little bit of a peak in the stock market."", ""And to me that's the problem with more than industrial commodities."", 'Silver is an industrial commodity now, copper and industrial commodities.', 'At some point, we probably should see a little bit backup in the stock market.', ""It's pretty expensive here mentioned earlier."", 'The mix is running around 11% handle.', 'The S and P 500 is 22% above its 100.', 'We move on average.', ""That's pretty much oftentimes a headwind for industrial metals."", ""And then there's China."", ""The key thing I'm worried about in China is Chinese C GB tenure note yield at 2.3%."", ""It's the lowest in our database."", ""It's over 200 basis points below the US."", ""That's a sign of deflationary, recessionary um in claims in China."", ""So I'm worried about that macro for industrial metals."", 'And the thing, the key thing is beta beta can keep going up industrial metals to do fine.', 'But in both environments, I think go a little outperform Mike.', 'How about the Fed?', 'Um Ho how does that play into your thesis on the precious metals?', ""Well, there's, I think gold is figuring it out is I don't think the Fed is going to ease into the stock market goes down and tells them to, it's kind of silly for the Fed to ease with pretty massive speculation and inflation above its targets in most markets."", 'So that to me is the problem.', 'The issue right now we have in the stock market is the total capitalization of us.', 'Stocks sounds about two times GDP.', ""That's the most since the 19 thirties."", ""So it's basically all that matters."", 'Stock market goes up sticky, inflation, stock market goes down, inflation goes down and that to me is part of the problem.', 'And that, to me is what gold is figuring out on, on the year gold is up about 17%.', 'The polar return for the S and P 500 is around 11%.', 'So that A I driven stock market is actually being beat by the rock.', 'When the rock beat stocks, you should be aware and I think the rock is gonna continue to beat stocks.', ""Yeah, that's so fascinating to me and also that the, that even that they're correlated at all, right, that they're going in the same direction."", 'Um How historically unusual is that?', 'Well, typically the correlation is zero.', 'But, but the, the big, the big thing was around 2008.', 'Initially, the stock market went down, gold went down and found 30% and then took off as the fed started easing.', ""I think it's going to be similar."", 'The difference this time is stock market is so much more expensive now than it was then versus GDP.', 'There was almost 1 to 1 now.', ""It's 2 to 1 versus GDP."", ""So I, I think it's still, obviously I'm a commodity guy."", ""I mean that by bias, but there's more, I think commodity I think is going to continue going higher as gold."", ""And if we get the normal packet fill in the stock market and you haven't had a 10% correction since October, then that's gonna probably launch gold maybe with an initial pullback."", 'But the bottom line for gold is the deepest pockets on the planet.', ""Central banks led by China are buying the metal and that from, according to the World Gold Council looks like it's early days and enduring."", 'So wait, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, Mike.', 'You said if you had to bet on any one commodity right now, it would be gold.', 'Oh, yes.', 'Well, I do.', ""I have to admit I've been saying that for a little too long."", 'I I admit that because you know, for the thing is that gold got to the point of maximum disdain.', 'How much, how long did it bump above 2000?', 'I mean, I was bullish gold in 2019 in 2020 it just made me lose more hair.', ""So, um I mean, it's just catching up now, but it's, it's that macroeconomic situation where relative to the stock market go is very cheap."", 'Stock market relevant to the GDP is very expensive.', 'And then we have this in this unlimited friendship between President Z and Putin.', 'It shifted the world order their most lot of worlds kind of trying to get away from the power and the first place to go is gold.', 'So Bitcoin in that space.', 'So to me, gold is still and go also has a history of beating most commodities in terms of performance, particularly in an environment where you see bond yields declining.', ""Now, we've seen that in the rest of the world ie Chinese yields are declining and I think it's a matter of time that stock market gives back a little bit allows us yields to go down."", 'That could accelerate this rally in gold Mike.', 'It was great having you on the show today.', 'Have a good weekend.', 'Thank you.', 'You too.', ""Outgoing Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun will remain on the company's board."", ""It's following a shareholder vote earlier today, the move comes as the company tries to stabilize production and quality and joining us now with more is Alexis Keenan Alexis."", 'Hey, yeah.', 'So there were two really closely watched issues in the shareholder vote.', ""One was that you mentioned there, Calhoun stay on the board, don't stay on the board despite that he's stepping down as CEO at the end of this year and it was against the advice of proxy advisor Glass Lewis."", ""So the other issue was whether to approve Calhoun's 2023 executive compensation at $32.8 million."", ""Uh He's been CEO of Boeing since January of 20 20."", 'Now, both of those votes coming in.', 'Yes.', ""So the new board will have Calhoun, he'll be the only the only non independent director there and then he'll be among the 11 member board."", 'Now, meanwhile, Boeing also looking for its new CEO and also trying to recover from the two fatal max.', 'Uh 737 crashes also that one non fatal accident in January back with that Alaska Airlines fuselage that detached at 16,000 ft.', 'So Boeing really having this sky of really red tape also including a pending decision from the justice department that has already said that the company violated deferred prosecution order that was attached to those two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.', ""And so the DOJ they're deciding whether or not it will criminally prosecute the company."", 'We should know that by July, uh also lawsuits tied to that Alaska Air incident.', ""You've got government investigations ongoing."", 'You also have more oversight of frost.', 'The company and its production also really just its tarnished reputation from all of these aircraft failures.', ""Now, during the shareholder meeting, Calhoun was asked about the company's financials."", 'Uh wanting to know one question was wanting to know if the company would go back to restoring its dividend.', 'It was just ended back in 2020.', 'But to respond to that, Calhoun said, well, the job number one is first returning to a steady cash flow.', 'Uh and they said that the objective was to do that by 2025 2026.', 'He said he was hopeful about that so far this year stopped down uh since January about 30%.', ""And also coming up for this company, Boeing is scheduled to meet with the FAA in two weeks and at that time, they're going to have to present a plan to get their house in order."", ""This is something that they've been working on and what they're presenting to the regulator is a way to many ways to enhance quality across the company, across production, across manufacturing guys, Alexis just quickly here."", ""I mean, listening to this litany and everything that's going on, one could be forgiven for saying why the heck did they approve him remaining on the board and on the pay package?"", 'Do we have any insight into the thinking on the part of shareholders?', 'Yeah, I wish I could tell you Julie.', 'Uh it was a real quick brush.', ""Yes, it's approved, there was very little talk uh about it at the meeting."", 'Um But uh it was absolutely against the advice of Glass Lewis and certainly a lot of people skeptical about the fact that Calhoun was at the helm at the time when this Alaska Air door came off of the aircraft in flight back in January.', ""So he's stepping down, but he's going to remain a member of the board."", 'I guess the positive news for some critical shareholders is that he will be the only non independent board member at this point since 2019.', 'The company has kind of done an overhaul of its board and they have a lot of new board members and they did mention during the call that a lot of those members have engineering experience, something that critics have wanted to come back to the company for

At the time of the spinoff, the rejected unit, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE: HII), was valued at approximately $2.5 billion in market capitalization, leaving the rest of Northrop Grumman with about a $14 billion market cap.', ""Today, Northrop Grumman is a $70 billion defense business\xa0worth five times its price 13 years ago. Huntington Ingalls stock has performed well too, but is up a bit less than 5x in value. Looked at that way, maybe Northrop Grumman didn't necessarily need to spin off its shipbuilding unit, but at least it didn't suffer from the decision. And Northrop may even have performed a bit better without its shipbuilding business than it would have, with it."", 'So why is Northrop Grumman trying to get back into the military shipbuilding business today?', 'That\'s exactly what Northrop seems to be doing. In a widely publicized announcement earlier this month (curiously widely publicized for what you\'d expect to be a secret project), the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced that Northrop Grumman has just completed full-scale sea trials of a new large drone submarine, built for DARPA and dubbed the ""Manta Ray.""', 'Shaped like its namesake, a manta ray with an oval body and two outstretched fins, the Manta Ray appears to measure roughly 40\' at its widest point by 40\' at its longest. DARPA describes the vessel as ""a new class of long-duration, long-range, payload-capable UUVs"" and equipped with ""several payload bays of multiple sizes and types to enable a wide variety of naval mission sets.""', 'It does not say what those missions will be.', 'Northrop Grumman itself, however, drops a hint, saying that Manta Ray will operate ""in ocean environments where humans can\'t go,"" which seems to suggest the vessel is designed for deep-sea operations. Indeed, Northrop notes that Manta Ray is an energy-efficient vessel, able ""to anchor to the seafloor and hibernate in a low-power state.""', 'Some media commentators have suggested the Manta Ray may be designed to sit dormant and undetectable on deep sea floors until activated and given a mission. Others are more specific, saying Manta Ray\'s stealthy design and long endurance make it purpose-built to ""scour the seas for Russian and Chinese submarines.""', ""Assuming these guesses are accurate, it's clear why the U.S. Navy might want a few Manta Rays in its fleet and why DARPA has been enlisted to recruit defense contractors like Northrop to build them. (In addition to Northrop, privately held PacMar Technologies has also won a contract to build its own Manta Ray for $55 million)."", ""What's less clear is why Northrop Grumman is diving back into naval waters, and for such a paltry sum. Assuming Northrop also got $55 million for its Manta Ray, that would amount to barely 0.1% of the $40 billion in contracts that Northrop rakes in in any given year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence."", 'So why change tack now?', ""Thirteen years ago, Northrop Grumman apparently decided that military shipbuilding wasn't a profitable enough endeavor and that its time would be better spent focusing on building airplanes. In recent years, the company has diversified further into space systems, acquiring one rocket maker (Orbital ATK) and partnering with another (Firefly Aerospace), and generally doing pretty well for itself."", ""The company did hit something of a rough spot last year when cost overruns in the development of its new B-21 stealth bomber for the Air Force pushed its aeronautics division into an operating loss. But even so, the rest of Northrop's businesses helped to smooth out the losses, and Northrop ended 2023 with a respectable $2.1 billion profit."", 'The problem with Northrop, it seems to me, is that whenever one of its business units starts to enter a rough patch, management overreacts and lurches in a new direction. Thirteen years ago, it made the decision to toss Huntington Ingalls overboard as the division was still dealing with losses from hurricane damage to its Gulf Coast shipbuilding facilities. Thirteen years later, Northrop may be lurching back into shipbuilding as a way to diversify away from the risk of overbidding on airplane contracts!', 'Not to knock Manta Ray or anything -- it truly looks like a great drone -- but maybe Northrop Grumman would be better off if it could just ""pick a lane."" Focus on one business to do well in, and when that business encounters problems, fix them -- rather than getting distracted and di-worsifying itself into something completely different.', 'Before you buy stock in Northrop Grumman, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Northrop Grumman wasn’t one of them.

This represents an annual dividend yield of 1.75% based on its share price worth $470.69 as of May 15.NOC’s annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s yield of 1.27%. This signifies Northrop’s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.', 'Northrop Grumman has been consistently boosting its shareholder returns, as is evident by its dividend payout worth $1,052 million and $1,116 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Such a solid distribution strategy is generally buoyed by the steady performance of a company in generating sales and stable cash flows from operations.Notably, NOC recorded an 8.9% year-over-year increase in its sales in the last reported quarter. Its cash and cash equivalents came in at $3.06 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, which improved 22.7% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Such solid cash balance and sales performances are likely to have enabled Northrop to enhance its dividend.Along with dividend payments, NOC’s management continues to increase shareholder value by repurchasing shares. In the first quarter of 2024, the company repurchased shares worth $1.19 billion, compared to $0.72 billion repurchased in the first quarter of 2023.It is imperative to mention in this context that Northrop Grumman’s business strength lies in the orders that it receives as one of the prime defense contractors, which converts into a robust backlog. Notably, the company exited first-quarter 2024 with a record backlog of $78.9 billion, backed by increasing demand and a rising global defense budget. This, in turn, shall boost NOC’s sales growth and cash flow in the coming quarters.Going forward, Northrop Grumman expects to generate sales in the band of $40.80-$41.20 billion for 2024, suggesting an increase of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.

That combination of impressive finances and a compelling valuation could lay the groundwork for excellent returns ahead. You might look back in a few years and regret not having picked up this highly profitable retailer. Let's look at some reasons why Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) is worth revisiting as a stock buy."", ""Lululemon's late-March quarterly update contained some troubling news about the business that formed the basis for its subpar stock performance lately. Q1 sales growth slowed to 9% in the core U.S. market from 12% in the previous quarter."", 'That was a better result compared to peers such as Nike (NYSE: NKE), which announced flat sales in its fiscal Q3. But Lululemon stock was priced for faster growth, and it was jarring for investors to see management forecast single-digit sales growth in the current quarter, down from 30% gains early last year.', ""Shareholders are understandably worried that there's more room for the stock to fall from here, since Lululemon is priced at a premium of 5 times annual sales compared to Nike's valuation of below 3 times sales."", ""The retailer is much closer to the beginning of its growth journey than to the end of it. Start with international sales, which expanded at a 56% rate last quarter. That figure shows how Lululemon's brand is resonating outside its most mature markets of Canada and the U.S. Yet international sales account for only 20% of the business today, compared to over 60% for Nike. That's a long growth runway."", ""Meanwhile, Lululemon is making smart, deliberate moves into new product categories and demographics. Recent hits include outerwear and footwear. The chain is also building beyond its core female demographic into kids' and men's apparel. Those moves will help the chain expand on its roughly $10 billion of annual revenue and toward Nike's $50 billion level."", 'Lululemon reported some eye-popping financial results for the 2023 fiscal year. Revenue soared 20%, gross profit margin jumped 3 percentage points to 58% of sales, and adjusted operating profit margin improved to 23% of sales from 22% of sales a year earlier. Each of those metrics made it an industry leader and reflected valuable competitive advantages like customer loyalty and pricing power.', ""Indeed, the next fiscal year will be a disappointment compared to those impressive figures. It's much harder to lift profitability when sales growth is closer to 10% than 20%. Investors shouldn't let that temporary slump keep them away from this stock, though."", 'Lululemon shares might stay volatile as Wall Street tries to predict the exact timing of its growth rebound. Patient shareholders can look past that prospect and focus instead on picking up shares of this strong retailer at a discount.', 'Before you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica wasn’t one of them.

Our model suggests a fall of 10% in wholesale revenues.However, the company’s transformation program – Reinvent -, which aims to enhance focus on brand-building and improve the operating performance, appears encouraging.

This is significant since many tech stocks tend to eschew dividends in favor of reinvesting for growth. It also confirms an impulse to offer payouts once they reach maturity."", ""Admittedly, Alphabet's dividend return of 0.5% is too small for it to attract the attention of income investors. Nonetheless, some tech stocks have begun to offer cash returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500's 1.3% average. With a continuous commitment to innovation, income investors should take notice of the potentially lucrative and growing payouts in these three stocks."", 'As one of the first tech companies to reach maturity, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) offered dividends to investors for decades. In April, it announced it would hike its payout to $6.68 per share annually. While that was an increase of just 0.6%, it marks the 29th consecutive year the dividend has increased.', 'Also, with a dividend yield of 4%, it has arguably become the dividend stock of the cloud. Arvind Krishna drove the 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, which placed IBM on the path to becoming a full-fledged cloud company.', 'That role in the cloud has also made it a player in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. This includes its team of consultants, IBM Research, and IBM watsonx. Watsonx is a business application that includes tools for model creation, storage, and AI governance.', ""Additionally, the company's stock has risen since Krishna became CEO in April 2020, a dramatic turnaround for a stock that lost value in most of the 2010s."", 'While one cannot describe IBM as a ""growth stock,"" the revenue declines have largely reversed under Krishna\'s leadership, and profits have increased.', 'Moreover, in the first quarter of 2024, the $12 billion in free cash flow for the trailing 12 months far exceeded the $6 billion in dividend cost during that time. This makes it likely that IBM will not only keep its payout, but also increase it on an annual basis.', 'Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI) plays a largely unseen but critical role in the wireless industry. It specializes in ""vertical real estate,"" owning many of the towers that support the United States\' wireless infrastructure.', 'As a real estate investment trust (REIT), it pays at least 90% of its net income in dividends in exchange for an income tax exemption on its operational profits.', 'To that end, shareholders earn $6.26 per share annually on the payout, a 6% cash return. Although Crown Castle has not increased the dividend since late 2022, the yearly payout has risen every year since it initiated the dividend in 2014.', 'Admittedly, Crown Castle faces some uncertainty, including a recent CEO change. Steven Moskowitz took over as CEO after former CEO Jay Brown retired in January. Still, even his 25 years of industry experience does not guarantee his success as a leader.', 'Moreover, revenue declines occurred as some Sprint contracts continue to get canceled due to its takeover by T-Mobile US.', 'Despite challenges, funding the dividend has not been an issue. Over the trailing 12 months, the dividend cost the company about $2.7 billion. This is significantly below the $3.2 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) income that funds the payout. That increases the likelihood that it will hike the payout this year and maintain its streak of annual dividend increases.', ""Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is credited with building the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, and its hardware and software solutions continue to support the world's technology infrastructure."", 'While it has become a slower-growth stock in recent years, it evolved into a notable dividend play. Its $1.60 per share in annual dividends yields about 3.2%. Even though the payout increased by less than 3% last year, it has risen every year since Cisco initiated the dividend in 2011.', 'Despite its dividend, the stock never recovered from the dot-com bust of the early 2000s as its switching and router business fell victim to falling demand and competition. More recently, it has become more of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock and recently acquired Splunk to increase its presence in cybersecurity. Still, it remains a mature, slower-growth business.', 'Despite its slowdown, Cisco generated nearly $14 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This covered about $6.3 billion in dividend costs, increasing the likelihood that the payout hikes will continue. Although investors should not expect Cisco to become a high-flying tech stock again, it should remain an attractive option for investors seeking income.', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.1%."", ""Several factors contribute to the cautious outlook for Target's first-quarter performance. Consumers have been exhibiting increased caution due to a persistently high interest rate environment, the resumption of student loan repayments and decreased savings rates. These have reduced discretionary income, forcing individuals to make trade-offs in their family budgets and prioritize essential purchases over non-essential ones.This shift in consumer behavior is likely to be reflected in Target’s overall sales numbers, with diminished spending on discretionary items. We anticipate a 3.6% decline in comparable sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting a 1.6% drop in the number of transactions and a 2% fall in the average transaction amount.Nonetheless, Target has been proactive in adapting its business operations to remain competitive. The company's strategic initiatives, including digital advancements, store investments, partnerships with popular brands and targeted merchandise actions to capture market share, are anticipated to have contributed to its overall performance. The company might have seen strength in frequency businesses.Target is likely to register margin expansion thanks to clean inventory as well as lower supply chain and freight costs.

Our model predicts comparable store sales to increase 2.6% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, driven by strength across its namesake and dd's DISCOUNTS business formats.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores was optimistic about its first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance, backed by the ongoing sales momentum. The company predicted comps to rise 2-3% year over year for first-quarter fiscal 2024, whereas total sales are forecast to increase 6-8% year over year.Additionally, the company’s results are expected to reflect the continued benefits of higher merchandise margin, lower distribution expenses, domestic freight and occupancy expenses due to the easing of supply-chain headwinds.

On a dollar basis, operating profit is expected to increase 18.2% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected an operating margin of 11.1-11.4% for the fiscal first quarter, reflecting lower incentives and freight costs, partially offset by lower merchandise margins and higher wages.The company envisions the bottom line to be $1.29-$1.35 per share for the fiscal first quarter, up from $1.09 reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance is anticipated to have gained from ROST’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in ROST’s sales for the fiscal first quarter.However, the company has been cautious about the current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties as well as persistent inflation, which has been affecting consumer spending on housing, food and gasoline. This is expected to have resulted in higher costs in first-quarter fiscal 2024, weighing on the company’s performance.Ross Stores has been witnessing higher costs due to the ongoing headwinds related to the ongoing macroeconomic volatility, rising inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The company has been witnessing rising incentive costs, which are likely to have led to increased SG&A expenses in first-quarter fiscal 2024.Our model predicts the cost of goods sold to increase 5.2% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.

But buying the highest-yielding stocks that have already been preselected for inclusion into an index is at least likely to cull out some of the worst options. And yet that still doesn't mean you will be investing in companies that you'll be happy owning. So, should you buy the three highest-yielding Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) stocks? Let's look at Dow (NYSE: DOW), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), and 3M (NYSE: MMM) to find out."", ""Just to make things complicated, one of the highest-yielding stocks on the Dow is Dow. Dow Inc. (just Dow from now on) is a large chemicals company, and it yields roughly 4.7%, which is fairly attractive given that the yield on the S&P 500 index is a tiny 1.3%. The one big negative for some investors will be that Dow's dividend has been static at $0.70 per share per quarter for years. But given the nature of the chemicals industry, that's actually not shocking."", ""To simplify a complex business, chemicals are often commodity items subject to material-price volatility. The inputs into the chemical-making process, meanwhile, are also commodities (oil and natural gas), which can lead to material changes in Dow's costs. Put the two together and you get a company that has highly variable earnings. It would be a risk for Dow to jack up its dividend payment during good years if it knows that an industry downturn is going to, eventually, come around and require a dividend cut. Thus, a dividend that is sustainable through the cycle is probably the best option. Dow is a fine company, but you need to go in understanding that the business is volatile, and the dividend isn't likely to grow over time."", ""Telecom giant Verizon has a much more reliable business than Dow because its cellphone customers create annuity-like revenue as they pay their bills each month. That provides the cash flow needed to support the company's big 6.5% dividend yield. Meanwhile, Verizon has increased its dividend annually for two decades. So far so good."", ""The problem is that Verizon's business is a mature one operating in a mature industry. Annualized-dividend growth over the past decade was less than 3%, which means it lags behind the historical growth rate of inflation. \xa0Yes, you are getting a material amount of income today, but the buying power of the dividend is shrinking over time. Verizon is really stuck between a rock and a hard place because the telecom industry is highly capital intensive, requiring massive capital investments just to keep pace with peers. If you are looking to maximize your income stream over the short term, Verizon could be a good option. But if you are planning to be retired for a couple of decades, like most 65 year olds will be, you might want to keep looking."", ""The last stock up is the easiest dividend story to tell in some ways and yet the most complex in others. Starting with the complex, 3M is facing material legal and regulatory headwinds today that have already resulted in large costs. It is likely that the costs will continue into the future, putting pressure on earnings and the company's dividend-paying ability. Moreover, to help raise capital for the expenses it is incurring, 3M recently spun off its healthcare business. And following that, the company has hinted strongly that a dividend cut is on the way. So, if you are looking to buy high-yielding Dow Jones stocks, you should probably hold off on industrial giant 3M until the next dividend announcement so you can really quantify what you are buying."", ""This is where the story gets simple. The yield today is listed at around 6% on some quote services and 23% on others. Why? Because of the complex story, since some services include the value of the spin-off in the yield calculation. That 23% figure isn't real, and, as noted, the 6% figure might not hold up, either. If you need your dividends to pay for living expenses, 3M is best avoided right now."", ""Given the nature of Dow's business, investors need to understand that dividend growth probably isn't going to be in the cards. That's not going to be attractive to a lot of income investors, and it suggests that deep pullbacks are the best time to buy the stock. Verizon's capital-spending needs are likely to keep dividend growth at this long-time dividend grower fairly modest. Again, not exactly a compelling investment story, though some might still find the high yield attractive. But both Dow and Verizon have better stories than 3M, which looks like it is about to cut its dividend."", 'Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

As it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been so strong that the company has been finding it difficult to meet the end-market demand, leading to long waiting periods."", 'The good news is that Nvidia has been boosting its production capacity, and that explains why it is expected to deliver another year of solid growth in fiscal 2025 (which has just begun). Its top line is expected to grow nearly 84% this fiscal year to $112 billion, while the bottom line is expected to jump 91% to $24.87 per share. All this explains why investors have been piling into Nvidia stock, which has already gained more than 82% in 2024.', ""Nvidia looks well placed to justify its expensive trailing earnings multiple of 75, considering the potential growth it could deliver. The sharp increase in its earnings going forward is evident from a much lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37. However, investors who have missed Nvidia's terrific run-up and are wary of paying a rich earnings multiple can consider taking a closer look at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)."", ""Just like Nvidia, Microsoft is also a key player in the AI market, and it can be bought at a reasonable valuation right now. Here's why savvy investors should consider doing that right away."", ""Shares of Microsoft have gained only 10% so far this year. This explains why the stock can still be bought at a relatively reasonable earnings multiple of about 35, which is much lower than Nvidia's multiple. Microsoft's forward earnings multiple of 31 also represents a discount to that of Nvidia."", ""Of course, Microsoft isn't growing as rapidly as Nvidia, but it has been consistently beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in recent quarters, and its growth has been accelerating."", ""For instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), Microsoft's revenue increased 17% year over year to $61.9 billion. That was a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth the company clocked in the same period last year."", 'Additionally, Microsoft\'s earnings growth also improved to 20% year over year in the previous quarter, from 10% in the year-ago period. AI is playing a key role in this acceleration, as Microsoft management noted on the latest earnings conference call. CEO Satya Nadella remarked that the company\'s Azure cloud platform ""took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions.""', ""More specifically, AI drove 7 percentage points worth of growth for Microsoft's Azure cloud business last quarter out of the segment's year-over-year growth of 31%. The growth could have been stronger had Microsoft been able to meet all the AI-related demand for cloud services, but the company said that demand has been higher than supply."", 'This explains why Microsoft has been ramping up its spending on cloud AI infrastructure across the globe in countries such as Japan, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the U.S. Even better, recent reports indicate that the tech giant could spend $100 billion on building a generative AI supercomputer through 2028. As such, Microsoft is setting itself up to make the most of the booming demand for cloud AI services in the long run.', 'According to a third-party estimate, the cloud AI market was worth an estimated $43 billion in 2022. The market is expected to post 36% annual growth through 2032 and generate a whopping $887 billion in annual revenue. Microsoft has generated just over $100 billion in revenue from its Intelligent Cloud division business in the past year, and the incremental growth opportunity in the cloud AI market indicates that it has a lot of room to grow in this space.', ""Throw in the potential AI-related gains that Microsoft could achieve in the AI-enabled personal computer and workplace productivity markets, and it won't be surprising to see the company's growth accelerating further in the long run."", ""Analysts are expecting Microsoft's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 16% over the next five years, which would be a slowdown compared to its 20% annual earnings growth in the past five years. However, observers have already seen that Microsoft's bottom-line growth is accelerating thanks to AI. So, it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings growing at a faster pace in the future."", ""Assuming Microsoft manages to get an annual earnings growth rate of 25% over the next five years, its earnings could hit $29.93 per share in fiscal 2028 (using fiscal 2023 earnings of $9.81 per share as the base). Multiplying the projected earnings with Microsoft's five-year forward earnings of 29 points toward a stock price of $868 after five years -- a jump of 110% from current levels."", ""But if the market decides to reward Microsoft with a higher valuation or the company delivers stronger earnings growth, this AI stock could deliver much stronger gains. That's why investors who missed the Nvidia train should consider jumping onto Microsoft stock before it steps on the gas."", 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

This strategy allows investors to capitalize on disruptive and secular growth trends, as well as benefit from the power of compounding.', ""For instance, a $10,000 investment in shares of Nvidia a decade ago is now worth a whopping $1.94 million. A big reason why Nvidia has made investors richer in the past decade is the secular growth trends in the gaming and data center segments, and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged the company's growth."", 'Of course, it would be difficult for other AI stocks to deliver Nvidia-like gains, but investing in companies that are on track to capitalize on AI development could help investors get rich over time and even help them get close to their goal of becoming millionaires.', ""In this article, I will take a closer look at Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), two companies that are playing a crucial role in the AI space. Investing in these two names and including them in a diversified portfolio could eventually help investors construct a million-dollar portfolio in the long run. Let's look at the reasons why."", 'Palantir Technologies is sitting on a huge growth opportunity within the AI software market. According to Bloomberg Insights, the demand for generative AI software could generate $280 billion in additional revenue through 2032. Palantir has delivered $2.33 billion in revenue in the past 12 months, indicating that it is at the beginning of a terrific growth curve within the AI software market.', 'The good part is that Palantir has already started gaining traction in the AI software space. This is evident from the metrics that the company reported for the first quarter of 2024. Palantir, which was primarily known for supplying data analytics and software platforms to government agencies, is now targeting commercial customers with its AI software platform. This has led to a nice jump in its commercial customer base.', ""For instance, in the first quarter of 2024, Palantir's count of commercial customers in the U.S. increased by an impressive 69% year over year. What's more, the total contract value of U.S. commercial customers was up 131% from the year-ago period to $286 million. This stronger growth in the contract value as compared to the customer count indicates that Palantir is driving greater spending from each customer."", 'The overall commercial customer count was up 53% year over year to 427 last quarter. In all, Palantir\'s overall commercial revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter to $299 million, outpacing the 21% growth in the company\'s overall revenue. Palantir management said on the company\'s latest earnings conference call that the new customers it is landing are ""expanding their work with us.""', 'Citing home improvement retailer Lowe\'s, Palantir said that the company has ""accelerated its engagement from a starting point of no AI to utilizing production level AI for over 1,000 customer service agents, resulting in a 75% reduction in overdue tasks.""', ""Not surprisingly, Palantir says that more customers are expanding their use of its AI software, which helped boost the company's revenue."", ""This is evident from the 38% year-over-year jump in Palantir's remaining performance obligations (RPO) last quarter, which is a metric that refers to the total value of its future contracts that are yet to be fulfilled. It won't be surprising to see this metric heading higher in the future thanks to the secular growth opportunity in the AI software market, especially considering that Palantir is among the top two players in this space."", ""All this explains why analysts are forecasting Palantir's earnings to increase at an impressive annual rate of more than 85% for the next five years. The long-term growth opportunity in the AI software market indicates it could sustain impressive levels of growth for a long time to come. That's why investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios that could help them become millionaires should consider buying Palantir before it flies higher."", ""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, is playing a pioneering role in the proliferation of AI. Nvidia may hold the limelight because of its dominance in the market for AI chips, but the graphics specialist wouldn't have\xa0 delivered such outstanding growth in revenue and earnings without TSMC."", ""That's because Nvidia is a semiconductor company that designs the chips but doesn't manufacture them. The manufacturing is done by foundries such as TSMC. This explains why TSMC is witnessing a turnaround in its fortunes."", 'The semiconductor market contracted 8.2% last year thanks to weak chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets. However, the market returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 with an 11.6% year-over-year increase in revenue, which can be attributed to the AI-driven demand for chips.', ""This year, the semiconductor industry's revenue is expected to jump 13%. AI is going to play a central role in this turnaround as the AI chip market is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 38% through 2030, generating an annual revenue of $207 billion at the end of the forecast period. TSMC is poised to take advantage of this secular growth opportunity because it is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with a market share of 61%."", ""Also, TSMC's manufacturing services are not only used by Nvidia but also by other companies such as Intel and AMD. All this explains why TSMC reported impressive growth last quarter. Additionally, its revenue for April shot up an impressive 60% year over year, indicating the terrific momentum it is now witnessing."", 'TSMC is working to produce more advanced chips, such as the 3-nanometer chips it expects will help create products worth a massive $1.5 trillion over a five-year period. There is a good chance that the company will remain the foundry of choice for chipmakers looking to capitalize on the AI boom.', ""As such, TSMC is a top semiconductor stock that investors can buy right now to make the most of AI proliferation. Its shares are trading at just 24 times forward earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Analysts are expecting the company's earnings to increase at 21.5% for the next five years, which could send its bottom line to $13.74 per share in 2028."", 'If TSMC trades at 30 times earnings at that time, its stock price could increase to $412, a jump of 182% from current levels.

Over the past several quarters, revenue and profit have climbed in the triple and even quadruple digits year over year. And the company has delivered better-than-expected earnings per share for at least the past four quarters."", ""Why is this recent past performance a good indicator of what's happening now? Because, as mentioned, we're still in the early days of the AI growth story. And Nvidia is the leading AI chip provider, with 80% market share. Though rivals may carve out a position in the market, the company still is likely to maintain a significant lead thanks to its constant innovation -- making it the go-to provider for those looking for premium chips."", 'Speaking of innovation, Nvidia aims to launch its Blackwell architecture and the most powerful chip ever later this year. That alone should drive a whole new wave of growth for the company.', 'So, with Nvidia shares trading for 36x forward earnings estimates, now looks like the perfect time to hit the buy button.', 'Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has reached a key turning point as it ramps up its cloud infrastructure to potentially become an AI leader. Once most known for database software, Oracle today has expanded to grow in the cloud -- and efforts are bearing fruit. In the most recent quarter, the technology giant reported a 49% increase in cloud infrastructure revenue to $1.8 billion.', 'Importantly, Oracle says demand for cloud infrastructure capacity continues to exceed supply, even though the company is quickly expanding current data centers and building new ones. So Oracle expects its Gen 2 Cloud infrastructure business to operate in a ""hypergrowth phase"" for quite some time.', ""Many cloud providers exist -- and Oracle isn't the biggest -- but the good news is the company doesn't have to be No. 1 to generate significant growth and top-notch earnings.

And thanks to its AI products and services, AWS' sales and operating income both climbed in the double digits in the recent quarter, helping the business generate a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate."", ""This shouldn't be too much of a surprise, as AWS, as the world's No. 1 cloud provider, is well positioned to benefit from customers' interest in AI. And Amazon has made an enormous effort to offer customers everything they need: from a variety of chips to a fully managed service that gives customers access to top large language models."", ""So it's clear AWS has what it takes to deliver an AI win over time. On top of this, Amazon itself also is benefiting from AI throughout its e-commerce business -- with tools that help it to lower costs and better serve customers."", ""Amazon shares trade for 41x forward earnings estimates, which may seem expensive compared to other tech companies.

However, the stock later rallied after reports came out that the company was set to develop its own artificial intelligence (AI) chips.', ""Let's take a look at Arm's most recent quarterly report (for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024), long-term guidance, and how its plans to design its own AI chips could fuel growth."", ""Arm turned in strong Q4 results, with revenue jumping 47% year over year to $928 million. License revenue surged 60% to $414 million, while royalty revenue climbed 37% year over year to $514 million. License revenue was driven by more companies signing long-term license agreements as well as more companies choosing to use the company's most advanced CPU (central processing units) technology to run AI applications."", ""The company added four additional Arm Total Access agreements, bringing the total to 31 customers. This is a newer program being offered by Arm whereby customers can pay an annual recurring subscription for the right to broad use of Arm's intellectual property. The company said more than half of its 30 largest customers and now using this subscription. Meanwhile, 222 customers are now using its more limited Arm Flexible Access program designed for early-stage companies."", 'This is a nice new subscription model from Arm that looks to drive revenue growth. It also lets the company get more revenue upfront than waiting for customer designs to go into production.', 'Royalty revenue, meanwhile, was bolstered by the continued shift to Armv9-based chips, which carry a higher royalty rate versus older-generation Arm technology. This is being seen in several markets, including smartphones, where Arm has a dominant position, with its technology incorporated in about 99% of all global smartphones. Armv9 is also seeing increased adoption in cloud servers, automobiles, and Internet of Things (IoT). Armv9 now contributes about 20% of its royalty revenue, up from 15% a year ago.', 'Looking ahead, Arm forecasts fiscal year 2025 (ending March 31, 2025) revenue to come in between $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, which would represent growth of between 18% to 27%. It is expecting adjusted EPS to come in between $1.45 to $1.65, up from $1.27 in fiscal 2024.', 'Looking further out, the company said it sees revenue growth of at least 20% for both fiscal year 2026 and 2027.', ""While Arm's results were strong, expectations going into the quarter were also very high. This can be seen in the company's valuation, as it trades at over 30 times the forward price to sales (P/S) and 75 times the forward P/E multiple. Arm has an attractive, high-margin, largely recurring business model, but those are some lofty valuation metrics nonetheless. When carrying high valuations, investors are often looking for results that are not just good but considerably better than forecasts as well."", 'While Arm shares sagged immediately following its earnings, shares quickly rebounded on later news that it was set to design its own AI chips. According to a report from Nikkei Asia, Arm will set up an AI chip division that will be partially funded by SoftBank (OTC: SFTBF), which owns 90% of the company.', 'It is aiming to to have its first prototype by spring of next year with mass production in the fall of 2025. SoftBank is negotiating with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and other semiconductor fabrication companies to secure production capacity at their facilities. Most semiconductors today just design chips and outsource production to companies like TSMC.', 'The report added that once Arm reaches mass production with its AI chips, the division could be spun off into SoftBank. Softbank is planning to build out data centers across the world using its own chips.', 'Arm has been making strides in AI data center applications as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has started to make superchips that combine its GPUs (graphic processing units) with Arm-based CPUs. While its new AI chip venture could increase competition between the two chip giants, it does look like it will already have a large built-in customer with SoftBank.', ""As discussed above, Arm's stock is not cheap. It's also controlled by SoftBank, so there could be some conflicts of interest between what is best for Arm shareholders and SoftBank. The latter is looking to make a big bet on AI and plans on using Arm as a launching point for its AI chip and data center ambitions."", ""While this could be good for the company, it is getting a bit out of the company's purview. It could be better for the company to stay in its lane and work on its partnership with Nvidia, which is currently the leader in the GPU space and is powering AI data center applications. With Arm architecture being incorporated into Nvidia superchips, now might not be the time to compete against the clear AI chip leader in the space."", ""Given its valuation and this consideration, I'd keep any positions in Arm on the smaller side at the moment. The semiconductor stock still has a lot of long-term potential, but there are also risks involved if it starts to compete with some of its large customers."", 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

You likely also realize, however, that many growth stocks require a great deal of ongoing monitoring. That's not something most investors want to do or even have time to do."", ""Fortunately, there's a simple solution: Buy a basket of growth stocks that someone else updates as needed. The Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) is your best bet among these baskets right now."", ""They're called exchange-traded funds, or ETFs for short. Just as the name implies, these are mutual funds in the sense that they hold several different stocks in their portfolios (so investors need only to own a stake in the fund in question). But since they're bought and sold in real time, just like conventional stocks, they're also considered exchange-traded instruments."", 'But why the Vanguard Growth ETF instead of similar alternatives, like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: IWF), the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: IVW), or even the popular Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ)?', 'Those exchange-traded funds have their merits, to be sure. However, the Vanguard Growth ETF boasts a handful of competitive advantages.', ""Chief among these advantages is its low cost to you. Its annualized expense ratio currently stands at a mere 0.04%, meaning the costs associated with managing and maintaining the fund only shave about 0.04% off the average yearly performance of the stocks held within the fund. For perspective, the Invesco QQQ Trust's expense ratio is 5 times greater at 0.2% of the fund's value, while the two iShares ETFs in question sport expense ratios similar to that of the QQQ Trust."", ""But does the Invesco fund's superior performance over the past 20 years make this added expense worth it?"", ""There's no denying that shares of QQQ have been a fantastic investment in recent history. The underpinnings of these gains, however, aren't necessarily sustainable. The underlying Nasdaq-100 Index has done exceedingly well of late, largely because it comprises names like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft -- stocks of companies that just so happened to be in the right place at the right time, so to speak."", 'But many of these organizations are now starting to see slower growth rates. Being overweighted with mega-cap companies, the Nasdaq-100 could be on the verge of a prolonged period of subpar performance.', ""This is in slight contrast to the better-balanced Vanguard Growth ETF. It's built to reflect the performance of the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) US Large Cap Growth Index, which also holds sizable stakes in the aforementioned Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple."", 'But with nearly 200 different constituents, including NYSE-listed tickers like healthcare outfit Eli Lilly and credit card middleman Visa, the Vanguard Growth ETF is arguably better positioned to stand up to cyclical weakness that takes dead aim at most technology stocks.', 'In such a scenario, the nickels and dimes stemming from differing expense ratios can start to add up.', ""Don't misread the message. The Vanguard Growth ETF is still a growth investment and, as such, is fully capable of dishing out sea-sickening volatility. That's not apt to change in the foreseeable future. If you need stability, look elsewhere, or at least don't make this particular exchange-traded fund the bulk of your portfolio."", ""Conversely, don't let neglect of several seemingly small things sneak up on you and end up crimping your long-term results. The Vanguard Growth ETF offers healthy growth potential at a reasonable level of risk. It also requires no ongoing effort from you since the CRSP -- and, therefore, Vanguard -- swaps out any of the index's or fund's stocks as needed."", ""And that's an added benefit in and of itself of holding this fund."", ""See, even most veteran investors can struggle to decide when to buy or sell a stock, often doing themselves more harm than good. With a third party making scheduled rebalances of the index, though, the risk of trying to time the market is negated. This often bolsters a fund or index's overall returns by virtue of locking in partial gains on exceedingly bullish stocks or scooping up stocks while they're temporarily down."", 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

Nvidia has moved up the ranks quickly thanks to its industry-leading AI-centric computer chips, currently worth $2.3 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms round out the other top 10 AI players, with market caps of between $2.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion.', ""With a market cap of roughly $789 billion (as of this writing), it seems clear that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is bucking for membership in this elite fraternity. Given the accelerating demand for the semiconductors needed for AI, TSMC's admittance might come sooner than later."", ""As the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC is in an enviable position in the industry. The company doesn't make semiconductors for its own use, but rather is contracted to make them for big tech companies, including Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others."", ""Once upon a time, the bulk of TSMC's revenue came from processors used in smartphones, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes chips used for AI, has taken the top spot, recently accounting for 46% of revenue."", 'Business is picking up. In the first quarter, revenue climbed 16.5% to $18.9 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 edged 5% higher. Management is expecting its accelerating growth to continue, forecasting second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 28%.', ""TSMC is in an enviable position in the AI revolution. It's a foundry partner to the AI stars, and since it makes chips for all comers, it's not a part of the fierce competition for AI chip supremacy. Given its position in the space and its current size, I don't think it will take very long to join the society of trillionaires."", 'According to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $84.8 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 9.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $107 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.', 'Interestingly, Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 22% in both 2024 and 2025. If the company achieves those fairly reasonable benchmarks, it could easily achieve a $1 trillion market cap by 2026.', ""There could be much more to come. TSM's management expects the company's AI-related revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the coming five years and account for 20% of TSM's total revenue by 2028."", ""That's not surprising, considering the magnitude of the opportunity. Generative AI is expected to generate economic value of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. However, estimates continue to ratchet higher as more applications for AI join the mix."", 'Finally, at just 24 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors an inexpensive way to profit from the AI revolution.', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.', 'In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Exelon.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Exelon ', 'Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', 'Exelon already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Exelon, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', 'Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Exelon Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$34m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

Here, two Motley Fool contributors take a closer look at Wall Street's opinions and why these energy stocks are a compelling way to energize investors' portfolios right now."", ""Scott Levine (ExxonMobil): Oil supermajor ExxonMobil has been the subject of two analysts' attention this week. On Monday, Mizuho Financial Group\xa0hiked its price target on ExxonMobil stock to $128 from $125 after it updated its multiyear outlook on energy prices. The following day, Morgan Stanley waxed bullish on ExxonMobil stock, resuming coverage on it with an overweight rating and assigning a $145 price target. Based on the stock's closing price of $117.87 on Thursday, Morgan Stanley's estimate implies an upside of 23%."", ""In addition to lauding the company's scale and its strong presence throughout the energy value chain, Morgan Stanley predicated its price target on the stock's valuation. Currently, shares of ExxonMobil trade at 14.4 times trailing earnings, which represents a discount to the S&P 500's P/E of 27.4."", ""During the presentation of its first-quarter 2024 financial results, ExxonMobil provided investors with management's profit forecast for the coming years. Should the price of Brent crude oil average $60 per barrel over the next three years, ExxonMobil projects net income will grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 10% from 2023 through 2027. And it's not as if the company believes that it has to achieve some extraordinary expansion in its margins to meet this forecast. Management forecasts meeting this profit target if it generates the same margins that its various businesses averaged from 2010 through 2019. Also, it believes that its ability to fuel growth in its upstream assets located in Guyana, the Permian Basin, and Brazil will significantly contribute to a growing bottom line over the next three years."", 'Lee Samaha (Devon Energy): A couple of weeks after raising its price target on Devon Energy to $57, Mizuho was at it again, raising the target again to $61 while retaining a buy rating on the stock. The latest move comes down to an improved commodity price outlook and a belief that Devon Energy is one of the companies better placed to profit from it.', ""Mizuho is right to pick Devon Energy as a winner in the sector due to its attractive valuation. The company's investment in drilling in its core Delaware Basin is already bearing fruit in 2024. In addition, the company's capital allocation strategy makes sense in the current environment."", ""Management finds the stock's valuation so compelling that it's prioritizing share buybacks over increasing its variable dividend in 2024. That might disappoint dividend-focused investors, but if you are bullish on the long-term prospects for oil and Devon Energy's ability to produce more of it, then it makes perfect sense to reduce the share count when the stock is trading on an attractive free cash flow yield. After all, the result will be that ongoing shareholders have a more significant claim to cash flows that will likely increase over time."", ""As for producing more oil, Devon's focus on drilling in its core assets in the Delaware Basin to improve overall well productivity resulted in the company beating production estimates in its first quarter. Moreover, management upgraded its full-year production forecast to 655,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D) to 675,000 BOE/D from a previous estimate of 650,000 BOE/D. Devon's management believes it's on track to improve well productivity by 10% in 2024."", ""While Devon's ultimate earnings and cash flow will be led by oil prices, the Wall Street consensus is for the company to generate $3.3 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2024. This means it trades less than 10 times the estimated FCF in 2024. It's an attractive stock for investors looking for energy exposure."", ""With analysts taking an optimistic view of ExxonMobil and Devon Energy this week, it's unsurprising that investors are considering them. Their future prospects are bright."", 'Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ExxonMobil wasn’t one of them.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) share price has soared 134% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 11% gain in the last three months.

This free interactive report on Oracle's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Oracle the TSR over the last 5 years was 154%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.

AI's powers range from the simple, like helping us save time on a routine task, to the complex, like helping scientists more quickly discover a game-changing drug."", 'Companies are pouring investment into AI, and the market is forecast to grow in the double digits to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. So now, in the early days of this high-growth story, is the perfect time to get in on the action.', ""And three top AI stocks in particular look like great buys right now in May. Let's check them out."", ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is set to report quarterly earnings later this month, and there's reason to be optimistic about the AI chip giant's performance. Over the past several quarters, revenue and profit have climbed in the triple and even quadruple digits year over year. And the company has delivered better-than-expected earnings per share for at least the past four quarters."", ""Why is this recent past performance a good indicator of what's happening now? Because, as mentioned, we're still in the early days of the AI growth story. And Nvidia is the leading AI chip provider, with 80% market share. Though rivals may carve out a position in the market, the company still is likely to maintain a significant lead thanks to its constant innovation -- making it the go-to provider for those looking for premium chips."", 'Speaking of innovation, Nvidia aims to launch its Blackwell architecture and the most powerful chip ever later this year. That alone should drive a whole new wave of growth for the company.', 'So, with Nvidia shares trading for 36x forward earnings estimates, now looks like the perfect time to hit the buy button.', 'Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has reached a key turning point as it ramps up its cloud infrastructure to potentially become an AI leader. Once most known for database software, Oracle today has expanded to grow in the cloud -- and efforts are bearing fruit. In the most recent quarter, the technology giant reported a 49% increase in cloud infrastructure revenue to $1.8 billion.', 'Importantly, Oracle says demand for cloud infrastructure capacity continues to exceed supply, even though the company is quickly expanding current data centers and building new ones.

There's room in this market for more than one player to succeed, and Oracle is showing it can carve out market share. It's winning over customers with advantages such as the flexibility if offers them on the cloud -- like the ability to use Oracle services on another public cloud -- and on pricing."", 'And that means, trading at 21x forward earnings estimates, Oracle looks like a steal right now.', ""Speaking of cloud providers, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the leader in that space through Amazon Web Services (AWS). And thanks to its AI products and services, AWS' sales and operating income both climbed in the double digits in the recent quarter, helping the business generate a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate."", ""This shouldn't be too much of a surprise, as AWS, as the world's No. 1 cloud provider, is well positioned to benefit from customers' interest in AI. And Amazon has made an enormous effort to offer customers everything they need: from a variety of chips to a fully managed service that gives customers access to top large language models."", ""So it's clear AWS has what it takes to deliver an AI win over time. On top of this, Amazon itself also is benefiting from AI throughout its e-commerce business -- with tools that help it to lower costs and better serve customers."", ""Amazon shares trade for 41x forward earnings estimates, which may seem expensive compared to other tech companies.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) uses Arm-based CPUs for its Grace CPUs that attach to their Grace-Hopper and Grace-Blackwell superchips, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) just introduced its own data-center CPU chip called Axion.', ""However, Arm isn't getting to the meat of the AI revolution, as it doesn't license its architecture for the GPU accelerators that are at the heart of AI processing."", 'But management is looking to change that. According to a recent report from Nikkei Asia, Arm is now looking to design its own AI accelerators, which it will introduce in 2025. According to the report, Arm will invest heavily in initial development costs, which it should be able to bear as Arm has about $3 billion in cash on the balance sheet as well as a highly cash-generative core licensing business. The report says it will outsource production to a third-party foundry, perhaps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.', 'So, Nvidia will have some increased competition, which may be why Nvidia attempted to buy Arm years ago.', 'Still, this may be a case of Arm being a bit late to the game in a crowded field. Virtually every cloud giant is now designing its own accelerators. And while Nvidia has a strong lead in ""neutral"" AI GPUs, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are each producing better and better ""neutral"" competitors.', 'Arm is 90% owned by Softbank (OTC: SFTB.Y), which is owned by the ambitious tech executive Masayoshi Son. Softbank had extended itself at the tail end of the tech-software bubble in 2021, so Arm investors must hope this isn\'t another example of ""me too"" thinking with a too-late entry into a red-hot tech sector. They\'d be right to have mixed feelings about this week\'s announcement.', ""Speaking of Google parent Alphabet, the search and cloud giant held its input/output (I/O) developer conference earlier this week. Unsurprisingly, there were numerous announcements related to AI, including the introduction of the aforementioned Axion CPU. But perhaps most notable on the AI chipmaking front was the announcement of Google's newest version of its tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator."", ""Google has been making its TPUs since 2013 but only offers them through its Google Cloud platform. Of course, Google also has a deep stock of Nvidia chips that customers can use as well, but every cloud giant is vying for having the best low-cost alternative that's proprietary to their platform."", ""That's why Google's announcement of Trillium, the sixth-generation TPU accelerator, was important this week. The new chip boasts a 4.7 times performance over the prior fifth-generation chip, while being 67% more energy efficient. The new chip is also adorned with a new third-generation SparseCore accelerator, with capacity to process double the high-bandwidth memory with double the interchip-connect bandwidth. This will allow the new TPUs to process larger models. Alphabet also announced the ability to string 256 Trillium GPUs together to make a Google-powered supercomputer as well."", ""The new hardware will be behind a slew of new AI services Google introduced at the conference, including an update of its Gemini 1.5 pro model, the large language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. But Google also introduced new specialized models for specific-use cases, including Veo, for high-definition video, Imagen 3 for text-to-image capabilities, and AI Sandbox, a music and sound-generation tool."", 'Finally, Google Search is also getting an AI-powered upgrade launching this coming Monday. Complex Google queries will now display AI-generated summaries and multistep plans for relevant searches. The new search summaries are good efforts by Google to avoid getting disrupted by aspiring search alternatives such as ChatGPT-powered Bing or start-ups like Perplexity.', ""And recent results imply Google's AI capabilities may be gaining traction, with its cloud platform reaccelerating to a 28.4% revenue growth last quarter and Search posting impressive 14.4% in its own right even up against aspiring disruptors."", ""When it comes to cloud infrastructure, many think of the big-three cloud platforms. But investors may not want to ignore database giant Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), which has been making efforts to fashion itself as a fourth cloud alternative. Oracle's infrastructure revenue only amounted to $1.8 billion last quarter, which was still far behind third-place Google at $9.6 billion. However, Oracle's infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenue also grew at 49%, the highest rate among cloud giants."", 'While it\'s easier to grow off a small base, those aspirations got a big boost earlier this week. According to The Information, Elon Musk\'s AI start-up xAI has been discussing a deal with Oracle cloud to rent its servers for AI processing in an amount up to $10 billion over ""a number of years."" Given that Oracle\'s cloud is currently on a $7.2 billion annualized run rate, that would be a big deal, making xAI one of Oracle\'s largest cloud customers.', ""One may wonder how a mere start-up can afford such largesse, but Reuters also reports that Musk's cache has led xAI to fundraising talks of up to $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation. xAI, whose chatbot Grok aims to take on Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, will have a unique angle with access to data gleaned from X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as visual data from Tesla vehicles."", 'Elon Musk has built successful businesses like Tesla and SpaceX from scratch before, although his takeover of Twitter has been much more dubious. Still, if xAI turns into a big-time LLM, it appears Oracle will reap a lot of the benefits.', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2024 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has been raised marginally over the past two months to $16.92.Shares of PSA have rallied 10.3% in the past month outperforming the industry's growth of 8.4%. Given its solid footprint, brand recognition, accretive buyouts and development and expansion activities, backed by a strong balance sheet, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Solid Footprint and Strong Brand Recognition: Public Storage has its market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers that have the highest population levels. As such, apart from benefiting from brand recognition, the company is likely to gain from economies of scale. Moreover, the company remains well poised to benefit from an approximately 35% stake in Shurgard Self Storage SA. In fact, the “Shurgard” brand, used by Shurgard Europe, is a well-established and valuable brand in Europe.Healthy Industry Fundamentals: The self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry continues to benefit from favorable demographic changes. Specifically, migration and downsizing trends and an increase in the number of people renting homes have escalated the need for consumers to rent space at a storage facility to park their possessions.Technology Investments: The company is also leveraging technology for revenue optimization and cost efficiencies and, as such, has invested in technologies over the past few years. Approximately 60% of customers utilized its eRental and Rent by Phone process during 2023. Such efforts are likely to further bolster the company’s competitive edge.Acquisitions & Development: Public Storage has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. Since the beginning of 2022, the company has acquired a total of 238 facilities with 16.8 million net rentable square feet for $3.4 billion. Following Mar 31, 2024, the company acquired or was under contract to buy four self-storage facilities across four states with 0.3 million net rentable square feet, for $34.6 million.As of Mar 31, 2024, PSA had several facilities in development and expansion, which are expected to add 3.7 million net rentable square feet at an estimated cost of $783.0 million. The company expects $500 million in acquisitions and $450 million in development openings in 2024. With solid access to capital, it is well-poised to take advantage of a potential opportunity.Balance Sheet Strength: PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with ample liquidity. The company maintains a strong financial profile characterized by solid credit metrics, including low leverage relative to its total capitalization and operating cash flows. It concluded the first quarter of 2024 with net debt and preferred equity to EBITDA of 3.9X and an EBITDA to fixed charges of 7.8 times. It also enjoys an “A” credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and an “A2” from Moody’s. With enough financial flexibility, PSA is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Moreover, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 36.17% compared with the industry’s average of 3.14%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Dividend Payment: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for investment in REIT stocks. Public Storage has consistently paid its dividends, even during the pandemic. In February 2023, it announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend from $2 per share to $3. This marked a hike of 50%. The annualized common dividend payment now equates to $12 per share.While the company has increased its dividend two times in the past five years, encouragingly, its payout has grown 9.58% over the same period. Looking at the company’s operating environment and financial position compared to that of the industry’s average, its current dividend is expected to be sustainable in the upcoming period.', 'Some other top-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are SL Green Realty Corp. SLG and OUTFRONT Media Inc. OUT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SLG’s 2024 FFO per share stands at $7.33, which indicates an increase of 48.4% from the year-ago period’s actual.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for OUTFRONT Media’s 2024 FFO per share is pegged at $1.71, which suggests 4.27% year-over-year growth.\xa0\xa0 \xa0Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here’s Why,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-stock-nyse-mcd-growth-205021129.html,1715979021,STORY,['MCD'],"['McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) showed signs of a slowdown in its Q1 results, leading to shares sliding lower in recent weeks. While the company entered FY2024 with a softer growth trajectory compared to last year, I don’t believe this necessarily sets a new trend. With this year’s numbers facing tough comps from FY2023, a breather in McDonald’s growth is to be expected. In the meantime, a rebound is likely to occur from FY2025 onwards, suggesting that the recent stock dip offers a buying opportunity. Thus, I am bullish on MCD stock.', 'The most important factor to recognize when looking at this year’s first-quarter results is that McDonald’s faces tough comps from FY2023. Last year’s promotions, smart pricing strategies against inflation, and very soft comps from FY2022 resulted in strong revenue growth. This year, the company will likely take a breather as it consolidates last year’s revenues and earnings. This doesn’t mean, however, that no growth will occur this year. In fact, FY2024 is expected to be another year of record revenues and earnings.', 'Taking a deeper look at McDonald’s first-quarter numbers, the most disappointing figure at first glance appears to be the rather lackluster same-store sales growth. It came in at just 1.9%, leading to total sales growth of just 4%. These are notably weaker numbers compared to the high-single-digit same-store and total sales growth figures we were used to seeing last year.', 'Nevertheless, McDonald’s performance was quite strong in the right context. Q1 celebrated McDonald’s 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, including 30% growth over the last four years.', 'In other words, McDonald’s sustained outstanding growth momentum during the past four years—some of the best years in its history. The fact that the company has not seen a temporary pullback but instead consolidates its current revenue levels is quite outstanding, in my view. Evidently, demand for its burgers and fries remains at all-time-high levels, defying saturation despite its, let’s say, impulsive expansion in recent years.', 'Besides the fact that McDonald’s first-quarter growth was strong in the right context, another factor that investors seem to have been ignoring these past few weeks is that the company is still set to deliver record financials in FY2024. Even more importantly, a rebound in growth is also expected to take place in FY2025.', 'In particular, the company ended the quarter with 42,018 restaurants, 3.7% more than in the same period last year. Its location count continues to expand, which, along with low-single-digit same-store growth, will likely result in meaningful total revenue growth for the year. Consensus revenue estimates point to a record $26.65 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 4.5%. When it comes to earnings per share, the market expects softer year-over-year growth of 2.2%, yet this still implies a record figure of $12.20.', 'In the meantime, Wall Street expects a rebound in revenue and earnings growth in the medium term to the mid-to-high single digits, mirroring last year’s rebound over the equivalent slowdown that occurred in FY2022.', 'Investors often complain that they hesitate to buy McDonald’s stock because it continuously trades at a premium. Well, the stock’s recent dip seems to have opened up a buying opportunity, as shares are likely undervalued against the company’s future growth estimates and McDonald’s overall qualities.', 'At 22.4x this year’s expected earnings-per-share and 20.6x next year’s figure, the stock appears to be trading at the low end of its five-year range of 20-30x.', 'One argument against this point is that interest rates remain high, hampering the stock’s investment case. However, seeing that most quality companies have retained rich multiples in this environment, I don’t see McDonald’s valuation getting notably compressed from its current levels.', 'Looking at Wall Street’s view on the stock, McDonald’s features a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on 19 Buy and nine Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. At $306.17, the\xa0average\xa0MCD stock forecast\xa0suggests 12.85% upside potential.', 'If you’re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MCD stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is David Palmer\xa0from Evercore ISI, with an average return of 15.03% per rating and an 86% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'To sum up, McDonald’s sales growth slowdown in its Q1 results, though concerning at first glance, is better understood within the context of tough comps from last year. While same-store sales growth may have dipped, the fact that the company sustains its abruptly higher sales levels and even keeps growing past them is a testament to the quality of its business model.', 'In fact, with financials set to hit new records in FY2024 and a projected rebound in growth for FY2025, the recent stock dip likely signals a buying opportunity.', 'Disclosure']"

MCD delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.4%, on average. The positive trend signifies bullish analysts’ sentiments, robust fundamentals and the chances of an outperformance in the near term.Shares of MCD have dwindled 7.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 2.9% decline. Over the past month, the stock has demonstrated resilience, showing a modest 1% improvement.The company’s prospects are hindered by ongoing inflationary pressures, especially commodity and labor inflation. Also, the negative impact of geopolitical tension in the Middle East market is an additional headwind."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Let’s delve deeper and analyze the factors.', ""Loyalty Program Bodes Well: McDonald's continuously seeks opportunities to enhance its top-tier loyalty program. Upon the launch of its loyalty program, the company has been able to transform its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in. The program has not only helped in retaining the existing customers but also in expanding the customer base. During the first quarter 2024, the company declared loyalty system-wide sales of more than $6 billion and approximately $25 billion in the trailing 12-month period.Also, during the quarter, MCD revealed its expectation to deploy “Ready on Arrival”, which is a digital enhancement initiative in the United States, to boost its loyalty program participants and encourage customers to avail the digital platform. This initiative is expected to be launched across the top six markets by 2025-end. Given a rise in digital adoption, the company is optimistic about reaching 90-day active users to 250 million and $45 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales by 2027.Footprint Expansion Plans: Being a globally operating fast-food chain, McDonald's is always considering its investment opportunities regarding the expansion to new as well as existing markets. Despite unfavorable global economic scenarios, the company continues to expand its global footprint, which can be evidenced by the opening of its 6,000th restaurant in China during the first quarter of 2024.The company is planning to open more than 2,100 new restaurants globally in 2024, including 500 openings in the United States and IOM segment and 1,600 (including nearly 1000 in China) inaugurations in the IDL market. The new unit growth aim showcases about 4% contribution to new unit growth (net of closures). Also, the company expects net restaurant unit expansion to contribute nearly 2% to 2024 systemwide sales growth. It targets to open 50,000 restaurants by 2027.Budget Menu Offerings: Apart from diversifying its menu items or adding new ones, MCD focuses on offering pocket-friendly menu items. This strategic move is undertaken after consideration of its customer’s demand patterns and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. The company aims to deliver scrumptious meals at affordable pricing, thus gaining the confidence of its customer base.During the first quarter of 2024 earnings call, the company declared high returns from its McSmart menu in Germany, reporting strong performance with record units sold. The McSmart value menu has been now been established in France and is driving progress in the market’s business trends. Furthermore, McDonald’s’ Everyday Value menu continued to drive results during the quarter in markets including Spain."", 'High-Cost Environment: McDonald’s is facing headwinds in the form of increased inflationary pressures and this scenario is expected to continue for some time. During the first quarter, McDonald’s company-operated restaurant expenses were $2.04 billion, up 6% from $1.92 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates, remains headwinds.Given the ongoing inflationary headwinds, the company expects the operating margin to remain pressurized in the near term. It expects commodity and food and paper inflation to be at the higher end in 2024. Also, it expects labor inflation to be in the high single digits.', 'Here are some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector.Wingstop Inc.

That's $100,000 more than a similar investment in an S&P 500 index fund. "", ""Brookfield's ability to grow its earnings and dividend at healthy rates has powered those strong returns. The company has grown its funds from operations (FFO) at a 12% compound annual rate since 2016. Meanwhile, it has increased its dividend by a 6% compound annual rate since 2001. "", 'The company is in an excellent position to continue growing shareholder value over the next several years. Brookfield Renewable expects a trio of organic growth drivers (inflation-indexed rate increases, margin enhancement activities, and development projects) to power 7% to 12% annual growth in its FFO per share through 2028.

He has called the company a better business than any of Berkshire Hathaway's\xa0subsidiaries and better than longtime Berkshire holdings American Express\xa0and Coca-Cola."", ""However, another company is attracting Buffett's attention even more these days: Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Could Buffett like this stock more than Apple because of its once-in-a-generation opportunity?"", ""The company has produced petroleum since 1920,\xa0 and it's been a long time since the oil business presented a massive shiny new opportunity for investors. But Occidental is pouring billions of dollars into an up-and-coming technology that could be another once-in-a-generation source of riches -- carbon capture and storage (CCS)."", ""As its name indicates, CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide and storing it so it doesn't affect the atmosphere. It has become a hot area of development due to increasing concerns about the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on climate change."", 'Occidental is focusing on direct air capture (DAC), a type of CCS where carbon dioxide is removed from the air. It acquired DAC pioneer Carbon Engineering last year for $1.1 billion. The company plans to build up to 135 DAC plants.', 'What will Occidental do with all of the carbon dioxide sucked from the air? President and CEO Vicki Hollub wants to use much of it in oil production. Her goal is for ""net-zero"" oil where the carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere cancels out the carbon dioxide emitted by burning the oil. The company has also already begun selling carbon credits to other companies.', ""ExxonMobil predicts CCS will be a $4 trillion business by 2050, and Occidental is one of the leaders in this nascent market. If the company's technology can be successfully scaled, Occidental could continue producing oil for decades to come without worries about its climate impact."", ""Buffett has expressed support for Occidental's carbon capture initiatives. But does he really like Occidental more than Apple? There are at least two reasons to think he might."", ""Most importantly, the legendary investor continues to aggressively buy shares of Occidental but sold nearly 13% of Berkshire's stake in Apple during the first quarter of 2024. Berkshire owns 28% of Occidental and has secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company."", 'In his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett listed eight stocks he expects Berkshire to ""maintain indefinitely."" Occidental was one of them, but Apple wasn\'t.', ""However, it's easy to argue that Apple remains Buffett's favorite stock. For one thing, the tech giant still makes up 39.7% of Berkshire's portfolio. That's nearly four times larger than the conglomerate's second-largest holding (Bank of America) and almost 10x the size of its position in Occidental. Buffett also said in Berkshire's recent shareholder meeting that Apple would likely continue to rank as the largest position."", 'Maybe Buffett likes Occidental more than Apple; maybe not. Either way, I think both companies are good picks for different reasons.', 'Carbon capture truly could present a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Occidental. I suspect the stock has significant upside potential, especially with Berkshire buying additional shares on a regular basis.', ""Apple could have yet another once-in-a-generation moment of its own with artificial intelligence (AI). The company is widely expected to introduce multiple AI innovations at its Worldwide Developers' Conference in June. I think it's possible Apple could enjoy a new supercycle of iPhone upgrades over the next few years, thanks to AI."", 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$4.68b', 'US$6.17b', 'US$6.24b', 'US$5.22b', 'US$5.34b', 'US$5.15b', 'US$5.05b', 'US$5.03b', 'US$5.04b', 'US$5.09b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ -3.58%', 'Est @ -1.79%', 'Est @ -0.54%', 'Est @ 0.34%', 'Est @ 0.95%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% ', 'US$4.3k', 'US$5.2k', 'US$4.9k', 'US$3.8k', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.2k', 'US$2.9k', 'US$2.6k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.4%) = US$85b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$85b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$38b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$73b.

Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.327. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

The company made tremendous progress over the past few years, culminating in its first regulatory approval -- for Casgevy, a therapy for the rare blood diseases transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.', 'Though that was an important milestone for the biotech, CRISPR Therapeutics remains unprofitable, and it is unlikely to launch another product in the next couple of years. In light of all that, is it worth investing in CRISPR Therapeutics today?', ""Developing gene-editing therapies is difficult, but commercializing them is its own challenge. To administer Casgevy, physicians first need to collect the patient's cells, which are edited and reinserted into them via a stem cell transplant. These procedures must be performed in authorized treatment centers. CRISPR Therapeutics originally created Casgevy, but co-markets it with the much larger Vertex Pharmaceuticals."", 'Teaming up with Vertex turned out to be a great move. With the large-cap biotech taking the lead on commercializing it, Casgevy has been approved in the U.S., Great Britain, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, with pending approvals likely in Canada and Switzerland.', 'Although CRISPR Therapeutics will only receive 40% of the profits associated with Casgevy because of its agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the deal was well worth it. There is no way a mid-cap biotech company would have been able to launch and commercialize a gene-editing therapy in that many markets that rapidly.', ""The target market for Casgevy isn't huge, at least for now. Vertex and CRISPR estimate that there are about 35,000 eligible patients in the U.S. and Europe. Vertex has also said it estimates there are about 23,000 eligible patients in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain."", ""International markets will be crucial for Casgevy as competing gene therapies have already been approved in the U.S. -- Zynteglo for beta-thalassemia, and Lyfgenia for sickle cell disease. Those are both marketed by Bluebird Bio, a small biotech company that exited the European market a few years ago. And while there are several more potential competing medicines in clinical trials, it's unlikely that many will earn approval in the Middle East."", ""In my view, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are well-positioned to grab upwards of 20% of Casgevy's total addressable market. The therapy -- a one-time treatment that should provide patients with a functional cure -- costs $2.2 million per treatment in the U.S., so there is a multibillion-dollar opportunity here."", ""So far, the partners have activated more than 25 authorized treatment centers globally and have started treatment on several patients although they have not shared exact numbers. It will likely take at least another year before Casgevy's sales rate approaches something like its full potential. But investors should expect strong and consistent revenue growth for years for CRISPR Therapeutics once Casgevy hits its stride."", ""Many beta-thalassemia and sickle cell patients aren't eligible for Casgevy as it is currently administered. CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are working on targeting those people, whose numbers exceed 100,000 in the geographies where they do business. If investors get anything out of CRISPR Therapeutics' success with Casgevy, it is that its gene-editing platform has the potential to unlock therapies for illnesses that have previously been difficult or impossible to effectively treat."", ""For certain conditions, even where treatment options exist, gene editing could do a much better job of addressing them. One of CRISPR Therapeutics' recent presentations highlighted gene editing's potential ability to fix a genetic defect that is the most common cause of glaucoma. Since glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness worldwide, it's not hard to see what developing a successful therapy could mean for the company."", ""Though CRISPR Therapeutics' work in that indication is still in the early stages, the company has five non-Casgevy candidates in clinical trials, targeting type 1 diabetes and various forms of cancers and cardiovascular diseases. The biotech has many more programs in pre-clinical development. Even though it won't bring any new treatments to market soon, CRISPR Therapeutics stock looks attractive for long-term investors, given the company's strong pipeline, innovative abilities, and the cash that will eventually flow from Casgevy."", 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

Most people do. Whether you're talking about groceries, airplane tickets, or automobiles, the lower the price, the better the buy."", ""Bargain prices aren't limited to physical goods though. Stocks can be bargains as well. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett largely became a billionaire, in fact, by buying value stocks as a means of maximizing the long-term bang he gets for his investment buck. That's why -- given enough time -- his Berkshire Hathaway fund outperforms the S&P 500. That's also why you would be wise to borrow a pick or two from Berkshire's portfolio when the need arises."", ""To this end, there's one particular Warren Buffett stock most investors might want to think about stepping into right now while it's still ridiculously cheap: The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO)."", ""You know the company. Coca-Cola is of course the world's biggest beverage outfit, just as its namesake cola is the world's most popular carbonated drink. You also probably know this is the company that owns Sprite, Barq's root beer, and all the variations of these fizzy beverages."", ""What you may not know is that The Coca-Cola Company is also the name behind a wide range of non-carbonated beverages including Minute Maid juice, Gold Peak tea, and Dasani water, just to name a few. This diverse product portfolio means it's got something that meets every consumers' taste at any given time."", ""It's not just this array of products that makes Coca-Cola stock a longtime Buffett favorite (although it certainly doesn't hurt the bullish argument). There's also the company's sheer size, and its subsequent reach. With greater scale the company can afford to advertise more aggressively as well as exercise leverage with its distributors and retail partners."", ""Perhaps the most compelling reason anyone would want to invest in Coca-Cola stock, however, is also the one that's least obvious. That's its business model."", ""The Coca-Cola Company doesn't actually do much bottling these days. It primarily sells flavored concentrates to localized, separately owned bottlers so it can focus on what it does best, marketing. This model offloads a great deal of the beverage business's operational risks such as soaring production costs or distribution hassles... a detail that has proven particularly beneficial to Coca-Cola of late in the shadow of soaring inflation. The company collects its regular royalties regardless of what it costs bottlers to manufacture the final product."", ""For Buffett though, Coke's brilliant business model is just a means to a bigger end. His ultimate goal is something else much more specific."", ""It (almost) goes without saying that the point of any investment in any stock is achieving a return on the capital you're putting at risk. Berkshire's $25 billion stake in The Coca-Cola Company is no exception to this norm."", ""Buffett's interest in this particular stock, however, is mostly rooted in how consistently the company's able to turn ever-growing revenue into ever-growing profits, much of which are immediately passed along to shareholders in the form of dividends."", ""While beverages aren't a high-growth business, they're a business that will never become obsolete. People will always get thirsty; they'll usually purchase the same beverage brands they've been buying for years. Coca-Cola's consistently delivered marketing messages ensure it."", ""End result? The Coca-Cola Company is a cash cow -- a slang term for companies that may not necessarily experience a great deal of annual growth, but are capable of generating cash flow in good times as well as bad. In this vein, Coca-Cola earned nearly $7.8 billion worth of net income in pandemic-crimped 2020, down a modest 14% from 2019's bottom line. Operating cash flow of more than $9.8 billion was within sight of 2019's $10.5 billion that year as well despite the headwind. And, both figures were far bigger last year, underscoring the company's resiliency along with its slow-but-steady growth cadence."", ""Shareholders continue to directly benefit from this bottom-line growth, too. As has been the case for years now, Coke's investors are still receiving on the order of three-fourths of the company's profits in the form of dividends. Last year alone Berkshire's 400 million-share position in The Coca-Cola Company would have produced $736 million worth of dividend income."", 'Those are dividends that have now been raised for 62 consecutive years.', ""The company's backstory and pedigree are certainly compelling, while the stock's trailing dividend yield of 3.1% is above average. But some investors might balk at this stock's valuation. Coca-Cola shares are currently priced at 25 times their trailing earnings, and more than 22 times their projected per-share profits. That's not cheap by most peoples' basic standards when evaluating a potential holding."", 'This is one of those cases where you can expect to pay a premium for quality, however.', 'See, ""cheap"" is a relative idea; cheaper than what? Factors that can force an investor to further redefine what qualifies as ""cheap"" are the length of time a particular company is apt to maintain its current level of risk, or results, or growth. At the same time, how certain are the answers to any of those questions? Additional uncertainty can also inform how much a price premium a stock deserves.', ""From this perspective, Coca-Cola is cheap not because it sports a low price-to-earnings ratio (because it doesn't), but because it's almost certain to continue cranking out steady earnings growth that will in turn drive steady dividend growth."", 'From this risk-minded cash-in-hand-right-now perspective, Coke stock is cheap.', ""Or if that doesn't convince you, this might. When Berkshire Hathaway first began acquiring shares of The Coca-Cola Company following the market crash of 1988 it only paid on the order of 17 times the stock's trailing earnings. The shares of the company Berkshire subsequently purchased after initially stepping into Coca-Cola, however, were bought at a price/earnings ratio as high as the low-20s. And the stock's valuation has lingered near that number ever since. Yet, the price of Coke stock has outright soared since Buffett stopped buying it back in the mid-90s. Clearly this low-risk stock's above-average valuation isn't holding its performance back."", 'Or, maybe Buffett just understands there\'s more to the matter than an arbitrary number based on past or projected earnings. In his own words, ""price is what you pay, value is what you get.""', ""That point applies perfectly to Coca-Cola shares right now. While the stock's sporting an above-average price-to-earnings ratio, the value you get for its price is actually a bargain. Don't overthink this one."", 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coca-Cola falls in, has gained 8.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Coca-Cola is expected to post earnings of $0.80 per share, indicating a change of +2.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 points to a change of +4.8% from the prior year.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Coca-Cola, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.88 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.8%.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

However, there are some companies that I own that I can comfortably say I hope to hand them off to my daughter someday (hopefully many years from now)."", ""Three of these forever-holds include Realty Income (NYSE: O), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Hershey (NYSE: HSY). Here's why I'm so fond of each of them."", ""Realty Income has a dividend yield of around 5.6% at this writing, which is near its highest levels of the past decade. The shares look reasonably attractive right now. But there's more to like than just a lofty yield, including the three decades' worth of annual dividend increases and the real estate investment trust's (REIT's) investment-grade-rated balance sheet."", ""That said, it's the core business that I really appreciate. Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT you can buy (a net lease requires the tenant to pay most property-level operating costs). It has a globally diversified portfolio of predominantly retail properties with a smattering of industrial assets."", ""Realty Income's massive size (it owns more than 15,400 properties) and financial strength allow it advantaged access to capital markets, giving it a leg up on peers when it comes to raising capital. A low cost of capital, meanwhile, allows the company to bid aggressively for properties and still turn a profit. It can also take on larger deals than its peers, including acting as an industry consolidator."", ""All in, slow and steady growth is the norm here, and I'm happy to own it, collecting a big yield year in and year out."", ""Procter & Gamble has a yield of around 2.4%, which isn't nearly as attractive as Realty Income's yield. That said, I bought the consumer staples giant when it was out of favor and yielding closer to 4%, so I'm sitting on some nice capital gains. But I have no plans to sell the stock, noting that it is financially strong (investment grade) and a Dividend King, with 68 years of annual dividend increases behind it."", 'The big story for P&G, as most people call it, is that it focuses on innovation to support its portfolio of industry-leading and mostly high-end brands. Basically, the company works hard to ensure that the extra cost of its products is justified by the value they offer. And, given its vast scale, it has the ability to invest heavily in the research and development, distribution, and advertising needed to ensure that customers are getting the best product.', ""In short, it is a valuable partner to the retailers it serves because P&G products get customers in the doors. As long as it keeps following this core approach, there's no reason to sell."", ""I have spent years watching Hershey stock, hoping for a chance to buy it. Well, that chance just showed up thanks to concerns about new weight loss drugs and skyrocketing cocoa prices. The stock's dividend yield is around 2.6%."", ""That may not sound exciting, but it happens to be near the high side of Hershey stock's historical yield range. I wouldn't call it a screaming buy, but I would say it is attractively priced. The dividend has been increased annually for 15 consecutive years, with a nearly 10% annualized rate of increase over the past decade."", 'The food company makes most of its money from chocolate products and other sweets, but it also makes salty snacks like popcorn and pretzels. There are two avenues for long-term growth as Hershey looks to increasingly expand its reach beyond the U.S. market in the confection space and grow its relatively new salty snacks platform.', ""As for cocoa, the prices are likely to stabilize over time, and so far, consumers have been willing to pay higher prices for their chocolate treats. New weight loss drugs are a bigger issue, but I believe this, too, will pass -- people just like chocolate too much for me to believe this company's most important business is in any long-term danger."", ""If you are looking for a stock to buy right now, Procter & Gamble isn't going to be the best option on this list. But it is an industry leader that you should probably put on your wish list just in case there's a broad market sell-off. Realty Income and Hershey, on the other hand, both look attractive right now. Realty Income will be most attractive to yield seekers, while Hershey will probably please dividend growth investors."", 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

With the move, Macerich has gained full ownership of both the properties.Apart from the acquisition, Macerich disclosed the execution of a contract for the sale of a prominent retail asset in a major market. This transaction, which is likely to close this summer, is expected to generate around $110 million of net proceeds based on an expected cap rate of 6.5%.These transactions showcase Macerich’s initial progress on its strategic plan that entails disposing of certain assets to lower its leverage and business simplification through selective consolidation of some JV interests over time.Achieving full ownership of these retail assets through the purchase of stakes from JVs seems a strategic fit for Macerich.The 1.1 million-square-foot, super-regional Arrowhead Towne Center is located in a high-growth area of Metro Phoenix. It is a leading, top 10 NOI center for MAC and a top 10 sales PSF center at more than $1,100 PSF — second only to Scottsdale Fashion Square among Macerich's Phoenix assets. Fully leased, it is anchored by Dillard’s, Macy’s, JCPenney, DICK’s Sporting Goods, AMC Theatres and Round1 Spo-Cha.The trade area comprises 1.6 million people and is home to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s new site. It consists of three fabs, opening in phases beginning in 2025, creating 6,000 direct high-tech, high-wage jobs, 20,000 construction jobs and numerous indirect jobs, bringing TSMC’s total investment in Arizona to more than $65 billion.Also, Arrowhead Towne Center’s trade area includes three top-ranked universities and 13,000 K-12 students. This area is home to more than one-third of Phoenix Metro residents and is projected to account for more than 43% of the county's growth over the next 25 years. Therefore, given the solid prospects, the acquisition of Arrowhead Towne Center seems prudent.The South Plains Mall, a 1.1 million-square-foot super-regional shopping center, serves the area surrounding Texas Tech University, which boasts a $4.3 billion annual economic impact. The trade area spans more than 40,000 square miles across 35 counties.With Lubbock’s population increasing at 6% annually, double the national average, the mall is poised for growth. Longtime anchor Dillard’s is investing more than $40 million in a new flagship store, consolidating its two existing locations, and is set to open in fourth-quarter 2024 on the former Sears site.Macerich, with a solid leasing pipeline, is likely to continue witnessing healthy leasing activity at its properties in the quarters ahead, driving occupancy. Its focus on omni-channel retailing augurs well. Shift toward re-use and mixed-use properties through recapture and repositioning of anchor tenants remains a key emphasis, while bringing brands to new markets at its mall will likely attract shoppers. However, growing e-commerce adoption raises concerns for the company.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Aflac in Focus', ""Aflac (AFL) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 5.62% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.3%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.75% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.58%."", ""In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2 is up 19% from last year. In the past five-year period, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.75%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 32%. This means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.46 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 3.69%.', 'Bottom Line', 'From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', 'High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is significant since many tech stocks tend to eschew dividends in favor of reinvesting for growth. It also confirms an impulse to offer payouts once they reach maturity."", ""Admittedly, Alphabet's dividend return of 0.5% is too small for it to attract the attention of income investors. Nonetheless, some tech stocks have begun to offer cash returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500's 1.3% average. With a continuous commitment to innovation, income investors should take notice of the potentially lucrative and growing payouts in these three stocks."", 'As one of the first tech companies to reach maturity, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) offered dividends to investors for decades. In April, it announced it would hike its payout to $6.68 per share annually. While that was an increase of just 0.6%, it marks the 29th consecutive year the dividend has increased.', 'Also, with a dividend yield of 4%, it has arguably become the dividend stock of the cloud. Arvind Krishna drove the 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, which placed IBM on the path to becoming a full-fledged cloud company.', 'That role in the cloud has also made it a player in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. This includes its team of consultants, IBM Research, and IBM watsonx.

This makes it likely that IBM will not only keep its payout, but also increase it on an annual basis.', 'Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI) plays a largely unseen but critical role in the wireless industry. It specializes in ""vertical real estate,"" owning many of the towers that support the United States\' wireless infrastructure.', 'As a real estate investment trust (REIT), it pays at least 90% of its net income in dividends in exchange for an income tax exemption on its operational profits.', 'To that end, shareholders earn $6.26 per share annually on the payout, a 6% cash return. Although Crown Castle has not increased the dividend since late 2022, the yearly payout has risen every year since it initiated the dividend in 2014.', 'Admittedly, Crown Castle faces some uncertainty, including a recent CEO change. Steven Moskowitz took over as CEO after former CEO Jay Brown retired in January. Still, even his 25 years of industry experience does not guarantee his success as a leader.', 'Moreover, revenue declines occurred as some Sprint contracts continue to get canceled due to its takeover by T-Mobile US.', 'Despite challenges, funding the dividend has not been an issue. Over the trailing 12 months, the dividend cost the company about $2.7 billion. This is significantly below the $3.2 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) income that funds the payout. That increases the likelihood that it will hike the payout this year and maintain its streak of annual dividend increases.', ""Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is credited with building the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, and its hardware and software solutions continue to support the world's technology infrastructure."", 'While it has become a slower-growth stock in recent years, it evolved into a notable dividend play. Its $1.60 per share in annual dividends yields about 3.2%. Even though the payout increased by less than 3% last year, it has risen every year since Cisco initiated the dividend in 2011.', 'Despite its dividend, the stock never recovered from the dot-com bust of the early 2000s as its switching and router business fell victim to falling demand and competition. More recently, it has become more of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock and recently acquired Splunk to increase its presence in cybersecurity. Still, it remains a mature, slower-growth business.', 'Despite its slowdown, Cisco generated nearly $14 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This covered about $6.3 billion in dividend costs, increasing the likelihood that the payout hikes will continue.
