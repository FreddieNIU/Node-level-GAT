If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the allure of Mexico for expats and retirees, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Mexico on a Budget of $2000 a Month.', 'Home to more than 2 million expats from around the world, Mexico stands out as a popular destination. According to the US Department of State, an estimated 1.6 million US citizens have chosen the country as their place of residence. Beyond its appeal to international residents, Mexico is also a prime choice for foreign investors, particularly those eyeing the real estate market. Foreign expats, especially retirees who wish to make Mexico their permanent abode, consider it more cost-effective to either rent or own property here.', 'This is especially true for American citizens, many of whom have already given up on the idea of owning a home back in the States. According to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), the median price of a home in America as of October 2023 is $413,504. Based on these figures, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) report highlights that a typical American household owns $40,000 less than the income needed to own a medium-sized house.', '“Buyers–particularly first-timers–who are committed to getting into a home now should think outside the box. Consider a condo or townhouse, which are less expensive than a single-family home, and/or consider moving to a more affordable part of the country, or a more affordable suburb.”', '-Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao.', 'Forbes, aligning with Chen Zhao, also advocates for considering affordable living but specifically points to countries like Mexico. According to Mexico Business News, houses acquired in Mexico through a mortgage loan averaged prices of over MX$1.6 million (US$93,800) in Q2 2023, up 11.5% from Q2 2022. Within the metropolitan areas, the Valley of Mexico witnessed an increase of 10.9%, Guadalajara by 12.5%, and Monterrey by 11.3%. Despite the rising prices, housing in Mexico remains significantly more affordable for US expats compared to the United States. Foreigners, especially retirees, can consider buying a home in this country and spending a comfortable retirement here.', 'Spending one’s golden years in a different country can be a grand experience. In particular, there are many advantages of living in Mexico as an expat retiree. From the pleasant year-round weather to the large expat community and reasonable cost of living, life is simple and relaxed . In America, a typical retiree spends $4,345 on average, whereas the cost of living in Mexico for a single person can vary between $600 to $2,000 a month.', 'Many expats report living comfortably in many areas of Mexico for $1,500 a month as well. The country can be pretty easy to live in. Expats in Mexico feel pretty much ""at home"", thanks to the large expat community. American chains such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) can also be found here in the country. There is McDonald\'s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Burger King, Del Taco, and Baja Fresh, to name a few. All in all, expat retirees report having the time of their lives.', ""However, retiring overseas isn't as simple as it may seem. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a good deal of preparation can help expats ensure a smooth transition."", '""I advise clients to get the ball rolling as early as possible, as there are several big items you\'ll need to check off your list to ensure a smooth transition.""', '-George Lee, CFP®, CWS®, director at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Asset Management.', 'To retire in Mexico, expats can begin by applying for a temporary resident visa. For visa approval, they need to provide a sufficient source of income outside of Mexico. The minimum monthly requirement is estimated to be $1,620. Those granted a temporary visa can live in the country for four years. In case they wish to live longer, a permanent visa needs to be applied for. Once a resident, the first concern of an expat is finances. Institutions such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) make it easier for expats to conduct transactions outside the States.', 'Potential expats should note that there are a few disadvantages to living in Mexico as well. First, retirees are better off living in the country if they learn Spanish. Even though there are many places where almost every other local is bilingual, learning the language can help get by more easily. Second, foreigners must keep a lookout for scams. From taxi scams to timeshare and even ATM skimming, a lot can happen if one is not careful. Lastly, even though the country is significantly cheaper than the US, there are lot of imported items and luxuries that cost at least 30% more than what one would find in the States.', 'Simon Dannhauer/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of best places to retire in Mexico on a budget of $2,000 a month, we began by searching for the best places on expat forums, Reddit, Quora, and websites such as International Living, Mexico Relocation Guide, etc. Next, we filtered out the places where living on a budget of $2,000 a month isn’t possible.', 'To determine the cost of living, we relied on Nomads List cost of living data, as well as used recent data based on actual expat experiences. The average monthly rents are discussed for a one-bedroom apartment in the city/town center, while the monthly cost of living is discussed for an individual retiree. Finally, a consensus approach was used to select the places, with one point awarded to each place each time it was recommended by a source. Scores were summed up and places were ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'For places with same scores, tie-breaking has been done based on cost of living, with the place with the lower cost of living ranking higher on our list.', 'Here are the best places to retire in Mexico on a budget of $2,000 a month:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 5 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $520', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $1,500\xa0\xa0 ', 'Ensenada offers the perfect beach-town vibe to retirees seeking a pleasant yet fulfilling retirement.

This city in east-central Mexico is revered for its rich cultural history and architectural style. The climate here is moderate with low humidity, making it pleasant to live in. Expats love to stroll through the narrow Puebla buildings, exploring local markets and experiencing traditional cuisine in the process. Healthcare is high-quality here, and many doctors have received their training from the US.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 6 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $1,000', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $2,000', ""If you wish to live in Tulum, it's best to buy a bicycle. This is the best advice you can get from expats living in the town because traffic can be bad here. Other than that, Tulum is home to some of the most striking beaches in the Mexican Caribbean, offering retirees a relaxed Bohemian vibe to relish. It is also renowned for fostering a health and yoga culture, providing retirees with the opportunity to embrace and enjoy a vibrant and wellness-oriented lifestyle.

History buffs love it for its Spanish colonial architecture, notable Baroque buildings, and also the ochre San Francisco church. Querétaro has a well-preserved historic center brimming with cafes, restaurants, and many markets. There are modern neighborhoods available on the outskirts that have American-style homes. Many expats choose to live in these. Healthcare facilities are also reputable, and retirees will find it nice to retire here.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 8 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $500', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $1,600', 'Another one of the best places to retire in Mexico on a budget of $2,000 a month (and even save some to save and splurge) is Puerto Morelos. Retirees appreciate this town for its warm Caribbean sun, gentle breezes, and relaxed pace of life. Expats report healthcare to be both affordable and good quality. There is a diverse expatriate community to socialize with, an exquisite culinary scene, and plenty of marine activities for sea lovers. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, located close to this town, is the second-largest coral reef system in the world.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 9 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $550', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $2,000', ""If you’re thinking of moving to Huatulco for good, it's best to let the winters pass and get yourself a good rental deal in the summer. This advice by expats is gold, considering Huatulco is a popular tourist destination where foreigners come to escape the cold. Warm weather, reasonable cost of living, and diverse marine life make it one of the best places to retire in Mexico."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 11 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $504', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $1,080', 'One of the safest and cheapest states to retire in Mexico is Oaxaca. Oaxaca City, in particular, offers retirees the best of both worlds — an abundance of big-city amenities combined with the inviting charm of a small-town atmosphere. This historic jewel is pretty affordable for retirees, and an individual retiree can live on $1,080 a month. However, the only condition is that you must know Spanish to live here, otherwise getting by would be hard.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 12 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $705', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $1,397', ""American expats find Cancun a great place to retire to, appreciating its pleasant climate and affordable cost of living. The “modern city on the Caribbean Sea” sits along the shores of the world's second-largest reef system, offering a prime gateway to savor the ultimate Caribbean experience.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\xa0 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, among these, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow, a decision that includes personal computing but excludes eCommerce and social media from the list. Given that everyone spends all their time on social media and orders everything online, the Dow's exclusion does raise a question about its suitability as the economic barometer.

Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments. This is because, after a crucial U.S. jobs report that showed the economy adding 190,000 jobs in November (economists were expecting 175,000), the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ dropped by 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, shed 0.1% and led the two in the early stages of the reversal."", 'So, with the economic climate improving amidst doubts of a recession, we decided to see which Dow stocks are loved by billionaires.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the crisis and companies that are promoting water usage efficiency and head over directly to the 5 World’s Most Water-Stressed Countries in 2040.', ""The world’s population has increased from 1.6 billion in 1900 to nearly 8 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, with 27 African countries being in the top 30 countries that'll contribute the most to the population levels in the coming decades. With an annual growth rate of close to 1%, demand for water, which is already scarce, is likely to surge in the coming decades as consumption by people, farms and corporations rise. As part of resource-depletion, water scarcity is one of the 10 biggest issues in the world.\xa0"", 'Climate change is also making matters worse, causing extreme rainfall in some regions, while other regions experience droughts.', 'According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), 14 of the world’s 33 most water-stressed countries in 2040 will be in the Middle East. The region, which already faces severe water shortage and relies on groundwater and desalinated sea water, is projected to face further water-related challenges in the coming years. This spells grave danger for a region already embroiled in violence and political conflict. Water scarcity and drought significantly contributed to the unrest in Syria, and is also an important dimension in the conflict between Israel and Palestine as well.', 'The US was ranked as the 47th most water-stressed country in the world by the WRI in 2020, and is forecasted to remain in this position through 2040 as well. A 2019 study by Earth’s Future, titled, Adaptation to Future Water Shortages in the United States Caused by Population Growth and Climate Change, noted that by 2071, 96 of the 204 fresh water basins in the US could see their supply reduced by as much as a third. A report in 2020 by the National Geographic cited that 40 of the 50 states in the US are expected to experience water shortage in the years to come as precipitation decreases and population soars.', 'Water efficiency is more important today than it ever was before. A number of companies in the US are leading the way in conserving this precious resource. Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) is a water technology provider that offers products and services related to water and wastewater treatment, water reuse solutions, drought relief and desalination, to meet the specific needs of customers in public, residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial segments.\xa0', 'This year in June, Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) received the Frost & Sullivan award for its role in water waste management and efforts to ensure water safety for future generations. The company is finding recognition world over, and not just in the US. Below is an excerpt of what Sandy Rowland, Senior Advisor and former Chief Financial Office, shared in Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) Q3 2023 Earnings Call:', 'The team has continued to deliver strong performance in Q3, exceeding expectations on growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share. For Xylem overall, total revenues grew 50%, while organic revenue rose 10%, led by particularly robust double-digit growth in the U.S. Western Europe grew a healthy 6% and emerging markets were down largely due to China, despite strengths in other parts of Asia and also in Africa.', 'Overall, demand remains resilient. Our backlog is now $5.2 billion, up 5% organically, and this includes a $1.3 billion contribution from Evoqua. Orders were up 3% in the quarter and book-to-bill for the company was approximately one. EBITDA margin was 19.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings, and favorable price-cost dynamics. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, up 14% year-over-year.', 'On the other hand, other companies are trying to reduce their water consumption. A prime example is NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). The company has been working for years on strategies to reduce its freshwater footprint. In 2020, the company declared that it had cut the use of freshwater by 30%. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) also announced that it was shifting its focus toward the use of recycled cotton because it bypasses the cotton growing phase completely which then comprised 69% of the company’s global water footprint.', 'In addition, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also undertaken restoration program projects in its supply chain, which aim at reducing pesticides, improving soil health, and increasing access to safe and clean water for the local communities. The company completed two such programs in 2021; in Maharashtra, India, and Murray Darling, Australia.', 'Another corporation that is creating a positive impact on the global preservation of water is Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL), which has for a long period been a market leader in water treatment. Through their services and technology offerings, customers are able to reduce water wastage, save energy and help protect the environment. Last week, a report in The Korea Times praised Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL)’s ESG management practices which have aided several Korean companies from earning profits, while reducing water consumption and carbon emissions.', 'Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) also invests in providing clean water across the world. In March 2023, the company announced to contribute $10 million to WaterEquity Global Access Fund to provide clean water to five million people in different regions of the world.', 'Katoosha/Shutterstock.com', 'World’s most water-stressed countries in 2040 are ranked based on forecasts by the World Resources Institute (WRI). Countries are listed in ascending order of WRI’s water-stress scores. The top eight countries on the list were categorized as joint first by WRI because they had the same scores. We have used water consumption levels in these countries as a tie-breaker to outrank some over others. Figures for water consumption have been obtained from various sources, including our recent article, Top 20 Countries with Highest Water Consumption, Worldometer, and other credible news agencies.', 'Let’s now head over to the list of the world’s most water-stressed countries in 2040.', 'WRI Score: 4.77', 'Libya is one of the world’s most water-stressed countries, and will remain so in 2040 as well. According to UNICEF, key drivers of water scarcity in the country include limited water resources, receiving low rainfall, a high population growth, and highly subsidized water tariffs.', 'WRI Score: 4.86', 'According to the World Bank, there is only 97 cubic metera of water available per capita in Jordan, which is well below the absolute water scarcity level of 500 cubic meters. The situation has further been aggravated by rising population growth and influx of refugees. By 2040, per capita water availability is likely to further reduce by 30%.', 'WRI Score: 4.91', 'Iran is projected to be among the most water-stressed nations in 2040 due to drought and inefficiency in water management in the country. According to local press, more than 260 cities in Iran faced water shortage, as of August 2023.', 'WRI Score: 4.93', 'Kyrgyzstan is one of Central Asia’s most vulnerable countries to climate change, with the country facing severe water shortage in the agricultural, domestic, and industrial segments. A report by UNICEF in 2017 projected that about 600 million children, or one in four, will be living in areas facing extreme water shortage in Kyrgyzstan by 2040.', 'WRI Score: 4.97', 'Lebanon faces severe water scarcity, with bulk and uncertain water supply sources. According to the World Bank, groundwater exploitation is extreme and unsustainable, with an estimated 20,000 licensed private wells and about 60,000 illegal wells. Most of the coastal aquifers suffer from seawater intrusion. Surface water storage capacity is also very low at just 6% compared to the regional average of 85%.', 'WRI Score: 4.97', 'Oman will be one of the world’s most water-stressed countries in 2040 according to the WRI. The sultanate uses more than 80% of its renewable water supply for domestic, industry, livestock, and irrigation needs. To meet the growing need for water, Oman’s government has developed advanced desalination plants to convert seawater into fresh water. Oman is also making investments in dams and reservoirs to tackle the threat of water scarcity.', 'WRI Score: 4.99', 'Saudi Arabia is among the most water-scarce places in the world, with only 89.5 cubic meters per capita available, whereas the global threshold for water scarcity level is 500 cubic meters per capita. Rural-to-urban migration, high population growth, hot temperatures, and poor water management have further exacerbated the situation. In 2016, the kingdom reversed its policy of self-sufficiency and decided to import all its wheat demand due to water shortage in the country.', 'WRI Score: 5.00', 'San Marino is the only European country that faces water shortage, and by 2040, will be one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. The country relies on Italy for 90% of its water supplies and has an absence of autonomous water resources.', 'WRI Score: 5.00', ""Singapore is heavily dependent on rainfall for its water due to a lack of natural resources, and limited land available in the city-state to construct water storage facilities on. As a result, the country faces high water scarcity with a WRI score of 5/5. According to Singapore's Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, about 141 liters of water per capita are consumed in Singapore."", 'WRI Score: 5.00', 'Palestine is among the most water-stressed countries in the world. Even before the 2023 war involving Israel and Hamas started, Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza had access to only 80 liters of water per day.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 63% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 4.4% in that time.', ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' View our latest analysis for Xylem ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', ""Xylem's earnings per share are down 1.5% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years."", ""By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements."", 'The modest 1.2% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. In contrast revenue growth of 3.2% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Xylem is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.', 'You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'Xylem is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Xylem's TSR for the last 5 years was 73%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""Xylem shareholders are down 3.1% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Microchip Technology's (NASDAQ:MCHP) look very promising so lets take a look."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""We're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Microchip Technology. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 306%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 20% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company."", ""In the end, Microchip Technology has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a staggering 161% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Microchip Technology can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead."", 'Microchip Technology does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.', ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Take Warren Buffett, for example. He's a strong advocate for dividend stocks and consistently incorporates a wide range of these equities into his investment portfolio each quarter. According to a Wall Street Journal article, Berkshire Hathaway is projected to get $5.7 billion in dividends for 2023. It's a given that when companies experience surging profits, it translates into immense wealth for the wealthiest individuals. Ownership of shares tends to be concentrated among those with higher incomes. For instance, in the US, the richest 1% own more than half of all shares. Sometimes, these prosperous companies are owned and managed by a small cluster of billionaire individuals and families. As profits grow, so does their wealth. Consider the Walton family, who controls half of Walmart, a major US retailer. In 2022 alone, they received a staggering $8.5 billion from dividends and buybacks, contributing significantly to their already substantial wealth, according to a paper published by Oxfam."", ""Billionaires' keen interest in dividend stocks stems from the impressive track record these stocks have displayed in the past.

As per a ProShares report, in the last five periods of increasing interest rates since 2005, dividend growth has consistently performed better than high dividend yield by an average of around 4%.

If you want to skip our analysis of the technology industry and how it continues to surprise, then take a look at 5 Most Popular Technology Stocks Among Billionaires. ', ""When it comes to the stock market, technology has been its savior in 2023. The year kicked off with investors fretting about an impending recession in America and the impact of high interest rates on the economy and the stock market. Higher rates aren't good for the economy, the market, or technology, and the outlook for 2023 was dour, especially since the bloodbath of 2022 that had caused triple digit percentage losses for big ticket names."", 'Enter A.I. While investors were fretting about interest rates, artificial intelligence was slowly gearing up to take the world by storm. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, whose ability to generate life like answers stunned both regular people and seasoned technology hands like Bill Gates. As it appeared that artificial intelligence is now ready to play a regular part in our lives, Wall Street aimed its guns at sectors that would benefit from it.', ""At the heart of investor attention was the semiconductor sector. ChatGPT is trained and powered by products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - the world's premier graphics processing unit (GPU) designer. NVIDIA's shares - and its financials - are now completely transformed from where they were a year ago. For instance, consider its share price growth and market capitalization in 2023. Year to date, the shares are up by 225%, and NVIDIA is now officially part of the trillion dollar club with a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion."", 'Its revenue during the latest fiscal quarter sat at $18.1 billion, which is simply unbelievable considering that during its fiscal year 2021, NVIDIA had raked in $16.6 billion. So, courtesy of A.I., NVIDIA earned more money during the three months ending in October 2023 than it had during the 12 months ending in January 2021. Of course back then it was reeling from a global supply slowdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and was yet to capitalize on the greater demand for technology products that the pandemic had ushered in. Similarly, NVIDIA is far from done, as its trailing twelve month revenue is $44.8 billion - marking a 66% growth over its latest fiscal quarter revenue.', ""NVIDIA's meteoric rise is also mirrored by the broader semiconductor industry. The PHLX Semiconductor (^SOX) index, a collection of the 30 biggest semiconductor firms in America, is up by a whopping 49% year to date."", ""At the same time, even as NVIDIA is the market's A.I. darling, other semiconductor technology companies are also introducing their products. The latest such announcement came from NVIDIA's smaller rival in the GPU market, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Unlike NVIDIA, AMD also holds a license to make and sell x86 central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors. x86 products have been the backbone of personal computing, and AMD's Advancing AI event held in December 2023 saw it introduce a full package of A.I. products, ranging from CPUs, to GPUs, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The event was particularly notable for the firm's total addressable market (TAM) estimates for A.I. accelerators."", ""TAM is a crucial component of financial statement modeling as it enables analysts to determine a firm's future cash flows by trying to estimate its market share. At the event, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su shared that a year ago the firm had estimated the total A.I. accelerator TAM to sit at $150 billion in 2027 on the back of a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% from its 2023 value of $30 billion. But She outlined that after taking a look at the market adoption of A.I. products, AMD now believes that the market is worth $45 billion in 2023 and will grow at a CAGR of 70% to be worth $400 billion by 2027."", ""Since A.I. and semiconductors are the hottest topics in the finance industry right now, here's what Fisher Investments' senior vice president Aaron Anderson had to say to Reuters' Elena Casas in a recent talk:"", ""Across the board for lots of different A.I. related companies, but certainly within semiconductors you've seen valuations expand. Although I will say you've seen growth pickup quite a big. Most of that valuation expansion has happened in the high end of semiconductor products. It's the fabless producers, and so forth, the designers for extremely in demand A.I. chips right now. And I think that by some measure they look expensive. You look at P/E ratios of some of the most prominent A.I. chip producers. You look a few years out, given what growth is projected to be, they don't look extremely expensive. Now you look at things such as price to sales and so forth, there maybe you could argue, there is a lot of optimism baked into them. But I think the fundamental tailwinds are real and a lot of these companies have got moats that are going to be very hard to compete with for coming years. So I do think higher valuations are warranted, I do think a lot of the optimism tied today in this sector is warranted. I do worry a little bit in some areas that some of the A.I. hyperscaling is ahead of itself."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top technology stocks that billionaires are piling into.

"", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc.

Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments.

When a company that most have discarded or ignored changes its fortunes for the better, the prospect of outsize stock returns is large. After all, Buffet once said, ""You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.""', 'Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) is certainly out of consensus, down 72% on the year and 97% below its all-time high. The company, which is a provider of network services and other fiber optic-based technologies, has certainly had a rough go. But with a new CEO in the beginning stages of her turnaround plan, is the stock a bargain-priced buy on this dip or value trap?', ""It has been exactly one year since ex-Microsoft executive Kate Johnson became the CEO of Lumen. Microsoft is a highly capable company to say the least, so her arrival provided hope for Lumen's turnaround efforts."", ""Johnson believes some of those efforts are already bearing fruit. On the recent conference call with analysts, Johnson noted improvements along several internal metrics, including the addition of 2,500 new customers since the start of the year, a 14% increase in Lumen's seller productivity, and the fact that existing customers bought 16% more of Lumen's newer products labeled under a category segment management has titled Grow. In addition, Johnson noted a big win in the digital inclusion government-funded broadband expansion program for the state of California."", 'Lumen is also upping its innovation game, with the advent of a new network-as-a-service (NaaS) product called Lumen On Demand. Like in cloud computing, this new type of dynamic revenue model will be based on consumption, allowing customers to only pay for what they use and not just a flat subscription fee. Johnson noted this new product is already in anchor customers across 13 industries.', 'Finally, Lumen recently reached a deal with creditors that hold $7 billion of the company\'s debt. In 2027, Lumen had a large maturity ""tower"" in which a lot of its debt would come due. Yet after the agreement with debtors, Lumen will have pushed out many of its maturities farther out, giving Johnson more breathing room to execute her turnaround. Moreover, the existing debtors agreed to fund another $1.2 billion in senior debt to the company -- a show of confidence in Johnson and Lumen.', ""While the new debt deal is a positive in terms of buying time, it's also somewhat of a negative, in that the new extended debt will come with higher interest rates, and the new $1.2 billion in financing will also increase Lumen's interest costs."", ""As a result, Lumen now plans to decrease its capital expenditures by about $200 million to $300 million per year relative to the amount outlined at its June Investor Day. That will largely come out of investing in Lumen's consumer fiber broadband business, where Lumen has seen a slowdown in adoption. The slower fiber consumer internet uptake jells with the slowing growth other broadband providers have been seeing recently, so this is not just a Lumen problem. For the consumer unit, management now expects to focus on selling into its existing fiber footprint and not building as many new passings."", ""Those decreased investments could hamper growth, and extend or impair the consumer unit's turnaround. While Lumen's enterprise unit is much bigger and more important, it's still a potential headwind to growth."", ""In addition to the added interest rate burden, and despite the positive metrics Johnson outlined in her remarks, Lumen's trajectory is still currently lower, as older technology products decline and customers churn. Last quarter, revenue slipped 5.2% after accounting for the company's EMEA business divestiture, and was down 0.5% quarter over quarter. But adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) fell even more by just over 20%, as the company made increased investments on a declining revenue base. This year's free cash flow is expected to be between $0 and $200 million, which is not very much. But remember, that doesn't include stock-based compensation, a real cost to shareholders, of another $65 million."", ""That's not great for a company that still has nearly $20 billion in debt -- a high load that's set to grow by another $1.2 billion per the new creditor agreement. That's especially high in relation to Lumen's distressed market cap of just $1.5 billion."", ""Bankruptcy risk is still on the table, and much will depend on Johnson's turnaround efforts. The good news is that since debt maturities have been pushed out, she has time to implement the new plan."", 'At the June investor day, management laid out its forecast for EBITDA to fall in 2024 and remain flattish in 2025, as the company will lose the profits from the businesses it divested this year and last year, and its turnaround products need time to overcome declining legacy products. But profits are forecast to step up in 2026 and 2027.', ""The problem is, investors may remain on the sidelines until that happens. Since that won't be for about two years, investors may want to watch this story from the sidelines until evidence of that turnaround manifests itself. Otherwise, the debt-burdened stock is currently still too dangerous."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', 'The $16,728 Social Security Bonus You Cannot Afford to Miss', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Billy Duberstein has positions in Microsoft.

The year kicked off with investors fretting about an impending recession in America and the impact of high interest rates on the economy and the stock market. Higher rates aren't good for the economy, the market, or technology, and the outlook for 2023 was dour, especially since the bloodbath of 2022 that had caused triple digit percentage losses for big ticket names."", 'Enter A.I. While investors were fretting about interest rates, artificial intelligence was slowly gearing up to take the world by storm. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, whose ability to generate life like answers stunned both regular people and seasoned technology hands like Bill Gates. As it appeared that artificial intelligence is now ready to play a regular part in our lives, Wall Street aimed its guns at sectors that would benefit from it.', ""At the heart of investor attention was the semiconductor sector. ChatGPT is trained and powered by products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - the world's premier graphics processing unit (GPU) designer. NVIDIA's shares - and its financials - are now completely transformed from where they were a year ago. For instance, consider its share price growth and market capitalization in 2023. Year to date, the shares are up by 225%, and NVIDIA is now officially part of the trillion dollar club with a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion."", 'Its revenue during the latest fiscal quarter sat at $18.1 billion, which is simply unbelievable considering that during its fiscal year 2021, NVIDIA had raked in $16.6 billion. So, courtesy of A.I., NVIDIA earned more money during the three months ending in October 2023 than it had during the 12 months ending in January 2021. Of course back then it was reeling from a global supply slowdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and was yet to capitalize on the greater demand for technology products that the pandemic had ushered in. Similarly, NVIDIA is far from done, as its trailing twelve month revenue is $44.8 billion - marking a 66% growth over its latest fiscal quarter revenue.', ""NVIDIA's meteoric rise is also mirrored by the broader semiconductor industry. The PHLX Semiconductor (^SOX) index, a collection of the 30 biggest semiconductor firms in America, is up by a whopping 49% year to date."", ""At the same time, even as NVIDIA is the market's A.I. darling, other semiconductor technology companies are also introducing their products. The latest such announcement came from NVIDIA's smaller rival in the GPU market, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Unlike NVIDIA, AMD also holds a license to make and sell x86 central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors. x86 products have been the backbone of personal computing, and AMD's Advancing AI event held in December 2023 saw it introduce a full package of A.I. products, ranging from CPUs, to GPUs, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The event was particularly notable for the firm's total addressable market (TAM) estimates for A.I. accelerators."", ""TAM is a crucial component of financial statement modeling as it enables analysts to determine a firm's future cash flows by trying to estimate its market share. At the event, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su shared that a year ago the firm had estimated the total A.I. accelerator TAM to sit at $150 billion in 2027 on the back of a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% from its 2023 value of $30 billion. But She outlined that after taking a look at the market adoption of A.I. products, AMD now believes that the market is worth $45 billion in 2023 and will grow at a CAGR of 70% to be worth $400 billion by 2027."", ""Since A.I. and semiconductors are the hottest topics in the finance industry right now, here's what Fisher Investments' senior vice president Aaron Anderson had to say to Reuters' Elena Casas in a recent talk:"", ""Across the board for lots of different A.I. related companies, but certainly within semiconductors you've seen valuations expand. Although I will say you've seen growth pickup quite a big. Most of that valuation expansion has happened in the high end of semiconductor products. It's the fabless producers, and so forth, the designers for extremely in demand A.I. chips right now. And I think that by some measure they look expensive. You look at P/E ratios of some of the most prominent A.I. chip producers. You look a few years out, given what growth is projected to be, they don't look extremely expensive. Now you look at things such as price to sales and so forth, there maybe you could argue, there is a lot of optimism baked into them. But I think the fundamental tailwinds are real and a lot of these companies have got moats that are going to be very hard to compete with for coming years. So I do think higher valuations are warranted, I do think a lot of the optimism tied today in this sector is warranted. I do worry a little bit in some areas that some of the A.I. hyperscaling is ahead of itself."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top technology stocks that billionaires are piling into.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\xa0 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, among these, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow, a decision that includes personal computing but excludes eCommerce and social media from the list. Given that everyone spends all their time on social media and orders everything online, the Dow's exclusion does raise a question about its suitability as the economic barometer.

Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments. This is because, after a crucial U.S. jobs report that showed the economy adding 190,000 jobs in November (economists were expecting 175,000), the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ dropped by 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, shed 0.1% and led the two in the early stages of the reversal."", 'So, with the economic climate improving amidst doubts of a recession, we decided to see which Dow stocks are loved by billionaires.

The stock market ended November with an optimistic rally, putting most investors and financial experts in high spirits regarding the state of the market. At the same time, market forecasters are beginning to see the easing of inflation at this point in the year as well. On December 8, Jared Bernstein, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), was invited to CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' to discuss the inflation outlook for 2024. Here's what he had to say:"", '""So, the best indicator of inflation is inflation. Inflation in the PCE, which is the index the Fed watches most closely, was zero in October, and of course, the CPI is down about two-thirds off of its peak. And the reasons for that are, I think, pretty knowable. I wouldn\'t call it immaculate, I\'d call it a normalization of supply chains, helping to really take down goods inflation. We know that there\'s been some easing off of rents, and that enters the CPI with about a 10-month lag, so we\'re seeing that on the shelter part, and as the job market has cooled, and it has cooled, it\'s an important point here, we\'ve seen a slower nominal wage growth, and that means a lot for services inflation. So, the general forecast, if you talk to a market forecaster, is that this easing of inflation should continue.""', 'All in all, Bernstein seemed to be quite optimistic about the latest trends in the economy, particularly the latest jobs report and the state of inflation in the US at present.', ""Jan Hatzius, the Chief Economist and Head of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, also joined CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on December 8 to discuss his take on market expectations regarding pricing cuts and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the possibility of a recession. Here's what he had to say on the matter:"", '""The market is looking for cuts pretty early, March, at this point, is, you know, half-priced or so, and I think a lot would have to happen for them to go that soon. I think the key thing though, from a broader perspective, is that they can cut. If the economy were to see more of a slowdown than we expect, then the Fed could cut and provide some support, and that means the risk of recession is, in my view, quite low. We\'re at 15% over the next 12 months.""', 'When asked when he expects to see the first cut from the Fed, Hatzius said the following:', '""I think in the second half of the year is more realistic than in the first half, but again, it\'s going to depend on the data and they could respond to a slowdown more quickly. Or if inflation comes down even more quickly to the target than what we have in our forecast, they could also go somewhat earlier.""', 'The comments noted above highlight how the US economy may be moving in a more positive direction come 2024.

(The ads go something like this: “I not only lowered my A1C but lost 16 pounds too!”)', 'The momentum kept on building. Soon, there were endless tales of celebrities — Sharon Osbourne and Tracy Morgan, to name a few — taking Wegovy and Ozempic and Lilly’s Mounjaro.', 'Then there were the endless tales of shortages and panicked diabetics getting shut out from their meds at CVS Health (CVS) stores and Walgreens (WBA). Adding to the frenzy was a study that showed that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, helped cut the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease by 20% among overweight or obese people with heart disease.', 'Despite all its good fortune, Novo does face challenges.', ""Even though Novo now controls 54% of the GLP-1 market, according to Novo's latest earnings report, others are trying to get into the GLP-1 game — or are pivoting back after a years-long break.

It's a given that when companies experience surging profits, it translates into immense wealth for the wealthiest individuals. Ownership of shares tends to be concentrated among those with higher incomes. For instance, in the US, the richest 1% own more than half of all shares. Sometimes, these prosperous companies are owned and managed by a small cluster of billionaire individuals and families. As profits grow, so does their wealth. Consider the Walton family, who controls half of Walmart, a major US retailer. In 2022 alone, they received a staggering $8.5 billion from dividends and buybacks, contributing significantly to their already substantial wealth, according to a paper published by Oxfam."", ""Billionaires' keen interest in dividend stocks stems from the impressive track record these stocks have displayed in the past.

If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the Dow, then you can skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Least. "", ""Even though 2023 is ready to race away into the past, one parting gift that it's given investors is uncertainty. The year has been full of ups and downs for the stock market, and throughout these past 12 months, investors have watched their investments go up and come down as they scuttle to adjust portfolios on the slightest of whims. 2023 started out by greeting a market that was wary of the Federal Reserve and its interest rate hikes. The Fed, for its part, had entered 2023 by raising rates multiple times by 75 basis points each, and investors, analysts, and economists were worried about the impact of these rates on the economy and particularly high growth technology sectors."", 'While the stock market itself is an economic barometer, indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 often see their performance varies by sector. For instance, last year as technology and growth companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were decimated due to high rates and inflation denting their markets, others such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) soared on the back of record high oil prices.', ""One index that is a better representation of the American economy is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). One of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow has seen all phases of the stock market's history - from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession in 2008. Throughout its life, it has seen numerous companies come and go, and since technology is the biggest sector of the American economy now, several technology companies are now present on the Dow. Being a member allows a firm to take the prestigious title of a blue chip stock, and right now, the Dow is made of 30 companies with the latest changes having taken place in 2020 when Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) made the cut and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Exxon, and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were given the boot."", ""Since the Dow is more diversified, its performance doesn't often see breakneck returns like other indexes such as the tech heavy NASDAQ 100. The index's constituents range from financial services to information technology, petroleum exploration, healthcare, retail, construction, semiconductors, and entertainment. So for instance, if semiconductors continue to rise on the back of strong A.I. spending but construction contracts should rates remain high, then the Dow's performance will reflect both these fluctuations. As a consequence, the Dow is up by a modest 9.12% year to date, while other widely known indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have gained 19.8% and 37.98%, respectively."", ""So, the Dow isn't known for blockbuster returns. This should make one wonder why is it so popular among investors and the media? Well, the answer to this question lies in two words: stability and diversification. Should one simply choose to invest in the index, then while the portfolio won't generate high returns, it would nevertheless prove to be a great buffer during economic turmoil. As an example of this principle, consider that between December 2007 and June 2009, the S&P 500 lost roughly 40% -\xa0 a disaster that shook the world. However, the DJIA pared off slightly better, as it prevented some of the losses to be down by roughly 35%. Since March 2009, the Dow is up by 396% while the S&P has returned 461%."", ""But what about stocks? We took a look at the best performing Dow stocks in 2023 as of November 17th 2023, and found that the three highest performers in the index were Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Overall, the top five performing Dow stocks were also technology companies, cementing technology's role as the market's savior in 2023."", ""Looking at this, it's important to know where the smart money is heading when it comes to Dow and blue chip stocks.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\xa0 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, among these, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow, a decision that includes personal computing but excludes eCommerce and social media from the list. Given that everyone spends all their time on social media and orders everything online, the Dow's exclusion does raise a question about its suitability as the economic barometer. If you want to find out about more social media and eCommerce stocks, then you can check out 10 Cheap Social Media Stocks to Buy and 10 Best Social Media Platforms For eCommerce."", ""So, what's the Dow up to these days? Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments. This is because, after a crucial U.S. jobs report that showed the economy adding 190,000 jobs in November (economists were expecting 175,000), the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ dropped by 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, shed 0.1% and led the two in the early stages of the reversal."", 'So, with the economic climate improving amidst doubts of a recession, we decided to see which Dow stocks are loved by billionaires.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Patterson Companies' current trading price of US$26.58 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap?

Let’s take a look at Patterson Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies ', ""Good news, investors! Patterson Companies is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 12.31x is currently well-below the industry average of 23.02x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, Patterson Companies’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

Patterson Companies' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since PDCO is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive profit outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on PDCO for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock.

If you want to skip our discussion on the poultry industry, you can go directly to the 5 Largest Poultry Producing Countries in the World.', ""The poultry sector has experienced tremendous growth in recent decades, driven by increasing consumer demand for both eggs and meat. According to a report by Research & Markets, the global poultry market is valued at $378.84 billion as of 2023, reflecting a 7.6% growth from 2022. The poultry market is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% up to $487.39 billion in 2027. Asia Pacific was the largest poultry-producing region in the world in 2022, followed by Western Europe.\xa0Poultry includes chicken, ducks, turkeys, and any other domesticated birds that are used for the purpose of harvesting eggs, meat, and feathers. However, chicken is the most sought-after poultry option, contributing to 90% of the world's poultry meat production. After a slow phase in poultry consumption caused by a weak global economy and the onset of avian influenza in poultry, reports suggest that the industry might already be recovering. This is mainly because feed costs are lower, leading to reduced chicken prices. The market is still price-sensitive, but poultry has gained an advantage with its competitive pricing compared to beef, pork, and alternative proteins in many markets."", 'Global poultry production has seen an upward trend, mostly due to the low prices of soybeans and corn. By 2032, global poultry meat production is expected to rise to 156 million metric tons. This increase is expected to be led by a 20 million metric ton increase in Asia’s poultry meat production. Almost half of the chickens produced for meat distribution come from Asia. China, Brazil, and the USA are among the top 5 largest poultry producing countries in the world. They are also among the top 5 countries with the highest domestic consumption of poultry. In 2023, Brazil was expected to witness a 3% rise in the production of chicken meat. Brazil is also the top exporter of chicken meat in the world, at 5 million metric tons this year. Steady economic growth in both developed and developing countries is helping the poultry industry expand. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports a global GDP growth of 2.7% in 2023. Emerging markets are anticipated to grow slightly faster than developed ones. This stable economic outlook is likely to boost investments in the poultry market, promoting the growth of poultry manufacturing in the coming years.', 'Key Players in the Poultry Industry', 'The global poultry market is saturated with many well-settled and emerging players.

If you want to skip our overview of the mining industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Junior Silver Mining Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""The mining industry is essential for proper global economic functioning. Mining, whether it's for petroleum fuels or for metals and minerals, provides the essential raw materials for industrial production, construction, electronics, agriculture, and other crucial sectors."", ""Within mining, oil and metals play a particularly important role. Oil's role is self-explanatory due to the world's reliance on petroleum fuels for transportation and power generation. Similarly, metals and minerals are used in a variety of industries as they enable industrial firms to make large and small scale engineered products."", 'One metal that is important in both the finance and engineering industries is silver. While not as lustrous as gold, silver still provides investors with an opportunity to buffer their money against inflation. At the same time, it is also used in a variety of industries such as solar panels and electric vehicles. What this means is that the price of silver - and the revenue of silver companies by extension - depends on global industrial and financial conditions. When the demand for safe haven assets is high and rates are low, silver prices rise. Similarly, when economic conditions are robust and industrial output is booming, silver prices see similar tailwinds.', ""Looking at this, it's no surprise that silver prices continued to rise as December began. November was a great month for the stock market as investors brought forward their bets for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This also means a weaker dollar as holding the greenback isn't as lucrative if interest rates are lower. Naturally, this was a boon for gold and silver prices, with silver in particular rising for three consecutive weeks to trade at a six month high of $25.47 per ounce."", 'Moving over to the industrial uses cases of silver, the metal benefits from high demand from solar panel manufacturers. While copper is widely known for its conductive properties, silver is widely thought to be the best conductor in the world. This makes it suitable for solar panel use, and silver works together with silicon in a solar panel to conduct electricity by carrying the silicon electrons to batteries after they are energized by sunlight hitting the panel.', ""This crucial use case that sits right at the heart of the world's renewable energy efforts is believed by several quarters to be a strong catalyst for silver demand. While solar panel manufacturers have decreased the amount of silver used per panel due to technological advancements, its electrochemical properties mean that the metal is indispensable when it comes to making the panels. Data shows that the percentage of demand for solar panels as a percentage of total silver demand is expected to grow from 5% in 2014 to nearly triple in percentage terms by the end of this year to 14%. In absolute terms, the amount of silver used in solar panels could grow by a whopping 169% by 2030 to sit at 273 million ounces per gigwatt in 2023."", 'The impact of this growing demand on silver companies is two fold. For starters, naturally, their market will grow and they will find more areas to sell their products in. However, at the same time, the sector will also have to significantly increase its output to ensure that demand stays in line with supply and does not outpace it. This also means that should they decide to invest heavily in new production sites, then the set up costs to bring mines online can lead to bottom line stress during the period that the mines are being developed and not producing the shiny metal.', ""To understand the impact that optimizing mines can have on a silver company's production, consider the comments made by the management of Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE:EXK) during its latest fiscal quarter earnings call:"", 'While this quarter’s results still put us on track to be within this year’s production guidance range, there’s a little room for setback in Q4. Guanaceví’s production shortfall is due to a number of factors. If you recall, we discussed initiating changes to our mine plan and infrastructure to improve working conditions for our employees by providing better ventilation and improving our water management. To address these conditions, we temporarily changed mine sequencing. This meant mining lower silver and gold grade stopes until we sufficiently address the temperatures and the water in blows lower in our mine. Ultimately, these issues could have been better managed to prevent impacts on production. Simultaneously increased sill development during Q3 to open more stopes further impacted Q3’s mine outlook.', 'Sequencing of sill development will continue to be a focus for Guanaceví to ensure a stable production schedule going forward near term and long term. While the temporary changes have lasted longer than we anticipated, conditions have improved and mine output has increased. With the conditions within the mine, management felt it was an appropriate opportunity for an extended plant shutdown to address areas within the plant requiring more time than our standard maintenance shutdowns. Considerable maintenance work is performed in all areas of the plant, including crushing, grinding, thickeners and the filter press to ensure we maintain consistent throughput going forward and alleviate risks that could result in unplanned downturn. With the plant maintenance completed in early October, both the mine and the plant are operating at or above capacity.', 'The combination of these events during the third quarter resulted in quarterly silver gold production decreasing by 22% and 13%, respectively. It equates to a production shortfall of nearly 400,000 ounces of silver compared to previous quarters and our annual mine plan.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top junior silver mining stocks.

If you want to skip our analysis of the technology industry and how it continues to surprise, then take a look at 5 Most Popular Technology Stocks Among Billionaires. ', ""When it comes to the stock market, technology has been its savior in 2023. The year kicked off with investors fretting about an impending recession in America and the impact of high interest rates on the economy and the stock market. Higher rates aren't good for the economy, the market, or technology, and the outlook for 2023 was dour, especially since the bloodbath of 2022 that had caused triple digit percentage losses for big ticket names."", 'Enter A.I. While investors were fretting about interest rates, artificial intelligence was slowly gearing up to take the world by storm. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, whose ability to generate life like answers stunned both regular people and seasoned technology hands like Bill Gates. As it appeared that artificial intelligence is now ready to play a regular part in our lives, Wall Street aimed its guns at sectors that would benefit from it.', ""At the heart of investor attention was the semiconductor sector. ChatGPT is trained and powered by products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - the world's premier graphics processing unit (GPU) designer. NVIDIA's shares - and its financials - are now completely transformed from where they were a year ago. For instance, consider its share price growth and market capitalization in 2023. Year to date, the shares are up by 225%, and NVIDIA is now officially part of the trillion dollar club with a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion."", 'Its revenue during the latest fiscal quarter sat at $18.1 billion, which is simply unbelievable considering that during its fiscal year 2021, NVIDIA had raked in $16.6 billion. So, courtesy of A.I., NVIDIA earned more money during the three months ending in October 2023 than it had during the 12 months ending in January 2021. Of course back then it was reeling from a global supply slowdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and was yet to capitalize on the greater demand for technology products that the pandemic had ushered in. Similarly, NVIDIA is far from done, as its trailing twelve month revenue is $44.8 billion - marking a 66% growth over its latest fiscal quarter revenue.', ""NVIDIA's meteoric rise is also mirrored by the broader semiconductor industry. The PHLX Semiconductor (^SOX) index, a collection of the 30 biggest semiconductor firms in America, is up by a whopping 49% year to date."", ""At the same time, even as NVIDIA is the market's A.I. darling, other semiconductor technology companies are also introducing their products. The latest such announcement came from NVIDIA's smaller rival in the GPU market, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Unlike NVIDIA, AMD also holds a license to make and sell x86 central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors. x86 products have been the backbone of personal computing, and AMD's Advancing AI event held in December 2023 saw it introduce a full package of A.I. products, ranging from CPUs, to GPUs, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The event was particularly notable for the firm's total addressable market (TAM) estimates for A.I. accelerators."", ""TAM is a crucial component of financial statement modeling as it enables analysts to determine a firm's future cash flows by trying to estimate its market share. At the event, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su shared that a year ago the firm had estimated the total A.I. accelerator TAM to sit at $150 billion in 2027 on the back of a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% from its 2023 value of $30 billion. But She outlined that after taking a look at the market adoption of A.I. products, AMD now believes that the market is worth $45 billion in 2023 and will grow at a CAGR of 70% to be worth $400 billion by 2027."", ""Since A.I. and semiconductors are the hottest topics in the finance industry right now, here's what Fisher Investments' senior vice president Aaron Anderson had to say to Reuters' Elena Casas in a recent talk:"", ""Across the board for lots of different A.I. related companies, but certainly within semiconductors you've seen valuations expand. Although I will say you've seen growth pickup quite a big. Most of that valuation expansion has happened in the high end of semiconductor products. It's the fabless producers, and so forth, the designers for extremely in demand A.I. chips right now. And I think that by some measure they look expensive. You look at P/E ratios of some of the most prominent A.I. chip producers. You look a few years out, given what growth is projected to be, they don't look extremely expensive. Now you look at things such as price to sales and so forth, there maybe you could argue, there is a lot of optimism baked into them. But I think the fundamental tailwinds are real and a lot of these companies have got moats that are going to be very hard to compete with for coming years. So I do think higher valuations are warranted, I do think a lot of the optimism tied today in this sector is warranted. I do worry a little bit in some areas that some of the A.I. hyperscaling is ahead of itself."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top technology stocks that billionaires are piling into.

What makes these coins earn their current-day sales prices comes down to how many coins were originally produced throughout their mintage, as well as how many are currently still accounted for. The materials and composition of the coins also add to their value since many have become precious and hard to find themselves.', 'Take, for example, the 1792 Silver Center Cent J-1. It was originally worth 1 cent — the penny of its day — when it was initially minted and subsequently released to the American public. The composition was primarily copper surrounding a silver center. Not only do these unique qualities add to its value, but the fact that the coin has a special strike from a pattern the United States Mint designed in 1792 and then began testing in 1793.

The stock market ended November with an optimistic rally, putting most investors and financial experts in high spirits regarding the state of the market. At the same time, market forecasters are beginning to see the easing of inflation at this point in the year as well. On December 8, Jared Bernstein, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), was invited to CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' to discuss the inflation outlook for 2024. Here's what he had to say:"", '""So, the best indicator of inflation is inflation. Inflation in the PCE, which is the index the Fed watches most closely, was zero in October, and of course, the CPI is down about two-thirds off of its peak. And the reasons for that are, I think, pretty knowable. I wouldn\'t call it immaculate, I\'d call it a normalization of supply chains, helping to really take down goods inflation. We know that there\'s been some easing off of rents, and that enters the CPI with about a 10-month lag, so we\'re seeing that on the shelter part, and as the job market has cooled, and it has cooled, it\'s an important point here, we\'ve seen a slower nominal wage growth, and that means a lot for services inflation. So, the general forecast, if you talk to a market forecaster, is that this easing of inflation should continue.""', 'All in all, Bernstein seemed to be quite optimistic about the latest trends in the economy, particularly the latest jobs report and the state of inflation in the US at present.', ""Jan Hatzius, the Chief Economist and Head of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, also joined CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on December 8 to discuss his take on market expectations regarding pricing cuts and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the possibility of a recession. Here's what he had to say on the matter:"", '""The market is looking for cuts pretty early, March, at this point, is, you know, half-priced or so, and I think a lot would have to happen for them to go that soon. I think the key thing though, from a broader perspective, is that they can cut. If the economy were to see more of a slowdown than we expect, then the Fed could cut and provide some support, and that means the risk of recession is, in my view, quite low. We\'re at 15% over the next 12 months.""', 'When asked when he expects to see the first cut from the Fed, Hatzius said the following:', '""I think in the second half of the year is more realistic than in the first half, but again, it\'s going to depend on the data and they could respond to a slowdown more quickly. Or if inflation comes down even more quickly to the target than what we have in our forecast, they could also go somewhat earlier.""', 'The comments noted above highlight how the US economy may be moving in a more positive direction come 2024.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) we really liked what we saw."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business.

If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PulteGroup here  for free."", ""PulteGroup is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 27%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 70%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", ""A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what PulteGroup has. And a remarkable 300% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist."", ""On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for PulteGroup   you'll probably want to know about."", 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ', 'As you can see below, Medtronic had US$25.0b of debt at October 2023, down from US$26.6b a year prior. However, it does have US$7.73b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$17.3b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Medtronic had liabilities of US$9.66b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$28.8b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$7.73b and US$5.93b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$24.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', 'Medtronic has a very large market capitalization of US$105.5b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Medtronic's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 36.4 times, makes us even more comfortable. Unfortunately, Medtronic saw its EBIT slide 2.5% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Medtronic's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Medtronic recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""The good news is that Medtronic's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Medtronic commonly do use debt without problems. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Medtronic takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Medtronic ."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires.\xa0', ""Dividend stocks hold a universal appeal, capturing the interest of both everyday investors and billionaires. Take Warren Buffett, for example. He's a strong advocate for dividend stocks and consistently incorporates a wide range of these equities into his investment portfolio each quarter. According to a Wall Street Journal article, Berkshire Hathaway is projected to get $5.7 billion in dividends for 2023. It's a given that when companies experience surging profits, it translates into immense wealth for the wealthiest individuals. Ownership of shares tends to be concentrated among those with higher incomes. For instance, in the US, the richest 1% own more than half of all shares. Sometimes, these prosperous companies are owned and managed by a small cluster of billionaire individuals and families. As profits grow, so does their wealth. Consider the Walton family, who controls half of Walmart, a major US retailer. In 2022 alone, they received a staggering $8.5 billion from dividends and buybacks, contributing significantly to their already substantial wealth, according to a paper published by Oxfam."", ""Billionaires' keen interest in dividend stocks stems from the impressive track record these stocks have displayed in the past. Their performance has been robust, showcasing consistent growth and stability over time. Dividends have been a significant part of investors' gains over the last 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total profit from the S&P 500 Index comes from reinvested dividends and the multiplying effect of compound interest."", ""Dividend stocks have caught investors' interest primarily because of their enticing dividend yield, which is the percentage of annual dividends compared to a stock's price. However, some studies have revealed an intriguing trend that stocks boasting high dividend yields haven't performed as well over the long term as those consistently increasing their dividends. As per a ProShares report, in the last five periods of increasing interest rates since 2005, dividend growth has consistently performed better than high dividend yield by an average of around 4%. This suggests that focusing on companies with a history of steadily increasing their dividends might be a reliable strategy across various market conditions, regardless of changes in interest rates."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Following complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, participants 18 years and older will be randomized 1:1 to receive V940 (mRNA-4157) (1 mg every three weeks for up to nine doses) and KEYTRUDA (400 mg every six weeks for up to nine cycles) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year or until disease recurrence or any of the other criteria for discontinuation of study intervention are met. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to any recurrence or occurrence of new primary NSCLC as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause. The secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), lung cancer specific survival (LCSS), safety, and quality of life.', 'Key eligibility criteria for the trial include: completion of surgical resection of histologically confirmed Stage II, IIIA or IIIB (N2) squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC, confirmation that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy is not indicated as primary therapy, no evidence of disease at the time of providing documented consent for the main study, prior treatment with at least one dose of adjuvant therapy with standard-of-care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy up to four cycles, and no more than 24 weeks between surgical resection with curative intent and the first dose of KEYTRUDA.', 'For further information, please see: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06077760?term=NCT06077760&rank=1.', 'About lung cancer', 'Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer in the U.S., accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 26.2%, which is a 22% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 4.5% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2022.', 'About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg', 'KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc.

Genes are the code on which a human body is built and they determine features such as height, eye color, and hair fall.\xa0Research shows that the global genomics industry was worth $27.58 billion in 2021 and it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% between 2022 and 2026 to be worth $63.5 billion by the end of the forecast period. This growth is expected to be fueled through government spending, as genomics starts to offer hope for treating painfully debilitating and often deadly diseases such as cancer.', 'Looking at this, you might be wondering what exactly genomics seeks to do. Well, the area primarily concerns itself with components of the human body that are called nucleases. A nuclease is a biological entity that is involved in repairing damage to the human DNA. It is essentially a protein called an enzyme, and genomics primarily works with three nucleases. These are zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9).

With an annual growth rate of close to 1%, demand for water, which is already scarce, is likely to surge in the coming decades as consumption by people, farms and corporations rise. As part of resource-depletion, water scarcity is one of the 10 biggest issues in the world.\xa0"", 'Climate change is also making matters worse, causing extreme rainfall in some regions, while other regions experience droughts.', 'According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), 14 of the world’s 33 most water-stressed countries in 2040 will be in the Middle East. The region, which already faces severe water shortage and relies on groundwater and desalinated sea water, is projected to face further water-related challenges in the coming years. This spells grave danger for a region already embroiled in violence and political conflict. Water scarcity and drought significantly contributed to the unrest in Syria, and is also an important dimension in the conflict between Israel and Palestine as well.', 'The US was ranked as the 47th most water-stressed country in the world by the WRI in 2020, and is forecasted to remain in this position through 2040 as well. A 2019 study by Earth’s Future, titled, Adaptation to Future Water Shortages in the United States Caused by Population Growth and Climate Change, noted that by 2071, 96 of the 204 fresh water basins in the US could see their supply reduced by as much as a third. A report in 2020 by the National Geographic cited that 40 of the 50 states in the US are expected to experience water shortage in the years to come as precipitation decreases and population soars.', 'Water efficiency is more important today than it ever was before. A number of companies in the US are leading the way in conserving this precious resource. Xylem Inc.

(NYSE:XYL) Q3 2023 Earnings Call:', 'The team has continued to deliver strong performance in Q3, exceeding expectations on growth, margin expansion, and earnings per share. For Xylem overall, total revenues grew 50%, while organic revenue rose 10%, led by particularly robust double-digit growth in the U.S. Western Europe grew a healthy 6% and emerging markets were down largely due to China, despite strengths in other parts of Asia and also in Africa.', 'Overall, demand remains resilient. Our backlog is now $5.2 billion, up 5% organically, and this includes a $1.3 billion contribution from Evoqua. Orders were up 3% in the quarter and book-to-bill for the company was approximately one.

Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, up 14% year-over-year.', 'On the other hand, other companies are trying to reduce their water consumption. A prime example is NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). The company has been working for years on strategies to reduce its freshwater footprint. In 2020, the company declared that it had cut the use of freshwater by 30%. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) also announced that it was shifting its focus toward the use of recycled cotton because it bypasses the cotton growing phase completely which then comprised 69% of the company’s global water footprint.', 'In addition, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also undertaken restoration program projects in its supply chain, which aim at reducing pesticides, improving soil health, and increasing access to safe and clean water for the local communities.

They both work by stabilizing the oxygen-transporting protein hemoglobin, keeping red blood cells from turning into the hard sickle shapes that get stuck and clog blood vessels.', ""While the newly approved gene therapies, Casgevy and Lyfgenia, offer the potential for dramatic benefit, oral drugs are still greatly needed for sickle cell because of the disease’s “wide variability,” said Kim Smith-Whitley, an adviser of scientific and clinical affairs at Pfizer and a former director of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's sickle cell center."", 'Sickle cell was for years an understudied field of medicine and, until 2019, the main treatment option for most patients was a repurposed cancer drug. Bone marrow transplants can be curative, but are only available for a minority of patients and carry additional risks.', 'For some people with sickle cell, Casgevy and Lyfgenia could eliminate the disease’s worst consequences. But they may not be the right choice for many, and will initially be only available at a select few specialized treatment centers. They’re also very expensive: Vertex set Casgevy’s price at $2.2 million, while Bluebird went higher at $3.1 million for Lyfgenia. Insurers are expected to cover them in some fashion, but it’s unclear how widely.', '“One therapy doesn’t exclude the other,” said Elliott Vichinsky, director of the University of California, San Francisco’s Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia Center. “The more therapy types, the better. There are just going to be issues of how you allocate these and where you put money into therapies.”', 'Pfizer’s data on GBT-601 come from 35 adults with sickle cell enrolled into “Part A” of the study; 17 were given a 100 milligram dose and the rest a 150 milligram dose. In both groups, treatment led to increases in hemoglobin levels of about three grams per deciliter after 12 weeks.', 'The trial is not designed to formally assess the frequency of the excruciating pain episodes, known as vaso-occlusive crises, that are a defining feature of sickle cell. However, researchers at Pfizer analyzed biomarkers involved in hemolysis, or the death of red blood cells, and found signs of improvement. In particular, they looked at “adherent” blood cells in nine study participants and found treatment led to a decline, suggesting the potential for lower risk of blockage.', 'Six of the 35 trial participants had at least one serious adverse event after starting treatment, including three who experienced sickle cell anemia with crisis. One participant died due to a cerebrovascular event that investigators judged to be unrelated to treatment.', ""“If industry, government and scientists are committed to completing these trials, and dedicated to this community to develop new therapies long term, it's an exciting time,” said Smith-Whitley, of Pfizer. “To see this much interest and potential in therapies that could mature in the next decade, I think that, hopefully, it will translate into not only increased survival, but a better quality of life for those with sickle cell.”"", 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

However, this isn't true."", 'Yes, the company has experienced a notable growth slowdown following monster growth in 2020 and 2021, thanks to the pandemic accelerating digital-payments activity. Revenue was up less than 9% in 2022. And through the first three months of 2023, sales increased by 8% year over year.', 'Higher interest rates, coupled with inflationary pressures, negatively affect a business like PayPal because its payment platform leans toward online purchases and consumer discretionary activity. These feel the pain when consumers are pinched and have to stretch their budgets.', 'But that top-line growth rate this year is hardly any cause for concern. It indicates that PayPal is not only keeping the gains it amassed during the pandemic, but also building on top of this.', 'In the most recent quarter (Q3 2023 ended Sept. 30), the company processed $388 billion of total payment volume (TPV), representing a 15% rise versus the same period a year ago. Four years ago, this figure was $199 billion.', ""There might be worries that PayPal's user base is hitting a plateau. Active accounts total 428 million, down 3 million from just three months ago and 4 million from a year ago. But again, this number is much higher than it was prior to the pandemic."", ""What's really encouraging is that engagement is increasing at a strong pace. During the third quarter, transactions per active account (during the trailing-12-month period) rose 13%. "", ""From PayPal's perspective, getting its existing customers to use the platform more often can be a boon financially. Less money needs to be directed to sales and marketing initiatives. And because this is a fee-based operation, greater usage results in higher revenue."", ""Investors also can't forget that this is still an extremely profitable enterprise. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) jumped 20% in Q3.

All of the company's excess cash is used to repurchase stock. Management plans to buy back $5 billion of shares in 2023."", ""Given how cheap the stock is valued (more on this below), this could be the best capital allocation decision that the leadership team makes. PayPal's market cap has averaged $75 billion this year, so retiring $5 billion worth of shares should have a substantial impact."", ""PayPal's fundamentals remain attractive for quality-focused investors. Despite macro headwinds, this is a business that isn't showing any signs of deteriorating."", ""And because the stock has gotten absolutely obliterated in the last couple of years, it's trading at an incredibly cheap valuation.

Quantum computing is an entirely new way for computers to operate."", ""These machines use atomic particles, such as electrons and ions, to execute calculations instead of the binary system of zeroes and ones employed by today's computers. This approach allows quantum computers to process mountains of complex data at a scale impossible for any conventional computer. Quantum computers are so powerful they can make obsolete many of the cybersecurity measures currently available. This is why organizations worldwide are working to implement quantum computing."", ""Two companies developing this tech are veteran IBM (NYSE: IBM) and newcomer IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). Owning either stock gives you exposure to the exciting technology of quantum computing, but since the field is still nascent, is one of these a better choice over the long haul as quantum computing ramps up? Let's look at each company to see whether there's a clear choice."", 'In 2021, IonQ became the first publicly traded business solely focused on quantum computing. In its brief history as a public company, IonQ has experienced rapidly rising revenue. For instance, third-quarter sales increased 122% year over year to $6.1 million.', ""The company anticipates this sales growth to continue and expects to notch at least $21.2 million in revenue in 2023, up from 2022's $11.1 million."", ""In Q3, IonQ secured $26.3 million in new bookings, which indicate the future revenue potential the company is amassing, as well as customer interest in IonQ's technology."", 'The company generates income by charging clients to use its quantum technology. Customers include universities and government agencies, like the U.S. Air Force Research Lab.', ""But as its revenue has grown, so have the company's losses. IonQ exited Q3 with a net loss of $44.8 million, an increase from the prior year's net loss of $24 million. So, investors shouldn't expect the company to reach profitability anytime soon."", ""Still, it's common for tech companies to operate at a loss for years in pursuit of business growth. Also, IonQ possesses a strong balance sheet, with total assets of $565 million, with $384 million of that in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Total liabilities were $67 million."", ""Although IBM's business is focused on cloud computing and AI solutions, it's seen as one of the leaders in the quantum computing field. That's because Big Blue has notched a number of accomplishments in quantum computing."", 'In 2016, IBM was the first company to make a quantum computer accessible via the cloud. Its quantum customers include Vodafone and RTX, the former Raytheon, which is working on quantum computing capabilities for the U.S. government.', ""Big Blue partnered with Cleveland Clinic to implement the first quantum computer dedicated to healthcare research. This partnership also incorporates IBM's main businesses of AI and cloud computing, illustrating how quantum computing is a natural fit within the company's primary offerings."", ""IBM doesn't break out revenue for its quantum computing business separately but, overall, is experiencing success. In Q3, it had sales of $14.8 billion, a 4.6% year-over-year increase. As a mature company, IBM's revenue growth isn't as spectacular as IonQ's, but IBM is profitable, with Q3 net income of $1.7 billion."", ""Moreover, IBM's financial strength allows it to offer a dividend, which is currently sporting an attractive yield of roughly 4%. The company has raised its dividend for 28 consecutive years, providing investors a dependable source of passive income."", 'Although IBM and IonQ both operate in the quantum computing field, they are very different investments. Compared to IonQ, IBM offers dependability over the long term because it is not reliant solely on quantum computing to maintain its business.', ""However, IonQ's quantum computing specialization enables it to focus resources on growing this business. That may not always be the case with IBM should company priorities force a shift away from quantum technology."", ""Another consideration is your investing approach. Income investors might opt for IBM for its reliable dividend. Growth investors with a high risk tolerance might find IonQ more to their liking because its shares hold the potential for greater upside in the long run. However, IonQ is a more speculative investment because it's a young company operating in a nascent field.

Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of James Kavanaugh's holding.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires.\xa0', ""Dividend stocks hold a universal appeal, capturing the interest of both everyday investors and billionaires. Take Warren Buffett, for example. He's a strong advocate for dividend stocks and consistently incorporates a wide range of these equities into his investment portfolio each quarter. According to a Wall Street Journal article, Berkshire Hathaway is projected to get $5.7 billion in dividends for 2023. It's a given that when companies experience surging profits, it translates into immense wealth for the wealthiest individuals. Ownership of shares tends to be concentrated among those with higher incomes. For instance, in the US, the richest 1% own more than half of all shares. Sometimes, these prosperous companies are owned and managed by a small cluster of billionaire individuals and families. As profits grow, so does their wealth. Consider the Walton family, who controls half of Walmart, a major US retailer. In 2022 alone, they received a staggering $8.5 billion from dividends and buybacks, contributing significantly to their already substantial wealth, according to a paper published by Oxfam."", ""Billionaires' keen interest in dividend stocks stems from the impressive track record these stocks have displayed in the past. Their performance has been robust, showcasing consistent growth and stability over time. Dividends have been a significant part of investors' gains over the last 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total profit from the S&P 500 Index comes from reinvested dividends and the multiplying effect of compound interest."", ""Dividend stocks have caught investors' interest primarily because of their enticing dividend yield, which is the percentage of annual dividends compared to a stock's price. However, some studies have revealed an intriguing trend that stocks boasting high dividend yields haven't performed as well over the long term as those consistently increasing their dividends. As per a ProShares report, in the last five periods of increasing interest rates since 2005, dividend growth has consistently performed better than high dividend yield by an average of around 4%. This suggests that focusing on companies with a history of steadily increasing their dividends might be a reliable strategy across various market conditions, regardless of changes in interest rates."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the Dow, then you can skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Least. "", ""Even though 2023 is ready to race away into the past, one parting gift that it's given investors is uncertainty. The year has been full of ups and downs for the stock market, and throughout these past 12 months, investors have watched their investments go up and come down as they scuttle to adjust portfolios on the slightest of whims. 2023 started out by greeting a market that was wary of the Federal Reserve and its interest rate hikes. The Fed, for its part, had entered 2023 by raising rates multiple times by 75 basis points each, and investors, analysts, and economists were worried about the impact of these rates on the economy and particularly high growth technology sectors."", 'While the stock market itself is an economic barometer, indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 often see their performance varies by sector. For instance, last year as technology and growth companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were decimated due to high rates and inflation denting their markets, others such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) soared on the back of record high oil prices.', ""One index that is a better representation of the American economy is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). One of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow has seen all phases of the stock market's history - from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession in 2008. Throughout its life, it has seen numerous companies come and go, and since technology is the biggest sector of the American economy now, several technology companies are now present on the Dow. Being a member allows a firm to take the prestigious title of a blue chip stock, and right now, the Dow is made of 30 companies with the latest changes having taken place in 2020 when Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) made the cut and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Exxon, and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were given the boot."", ""Since the Dow is more diversified, its performance doesn't often see breakneck returns like other indexes such as the tech heavy NASDAQ 100. The index's constituents range from financial services to information technology, petroleum exploration, healthcare, retail, construction, semiconductors, and entertainment. So for instance, if semiconductors continue to rise on the back of strong A.I. spending but construction contracts should rates remain high, then the Dow's performance will reflect both these fluctuations. As a consequence, the Dow is up by a modest 9.12% year to date, while other widely known indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have gained 19.8% and 37.98%, respectively."", ""So, the Dow isn't known for blockbuster returns. This should make one wonder why is it so popular among investors and the media? Well, the answer to this question lies in two words: stability and diversification. Should one simply choose to invest in the index, then while the portfolio won't generate high returns, it would nevertheless prove to be a great buffer during economic turmoil. As an example of this principle, consider that between December 2007 and June 2009, the S&P 500 lost roughly 40% -\xa0 a disaster that shook the world. However, the DJIA pared off slightly better, as it prevented some of the losses to be down by roughly 35%.

If you want to skip our introduction to the electric vehicle industry and how recent trends have shaken investor faith, then you can take a look at 5 Best EV Stocks To Buy For 2024. ', ""The electric vehicle industry is one of the few sectors right now that most believe will yield massive dividends in the future. This is because the sector is relatively nascent when compared to several other industries. For instance, the personal computing market is more than three decades old, and the true growth here has come over the past decade as advances in the Internet and processing power have created demand and reduced costs for the products. Similarly, the EV sector's largest rival, the internal combustion automotive industry, is a century old after its first roots were put in place by Rolls-Royce and the Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in the early 20th century."", ""Don't Miss: Best EV Stocks to Buy Under $50"", ""Like personal computing, electric vehicles have had to overcome manufacturing bottlenecks to ensure that they can be produced in sufficient volumes to reduce per unit fixed costs and generate substantial revenue to fund future growth. At the heart of today's electric vehicle race is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose manufacturing troubles at the tail end of the 2010s helped set up the foundation for mass production. Now, dozens of other companies also make and sell either pure electric vehicles or hybrids. These also include big ticket traditional car manufacturers such as Ford and the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)."", ""The difference between GM and Ford's market capitalization compared to Tesla's is the biggest indicator of how investors view EVs and traditional cars differently. For instance, consider the market cap of the former two. Combined, the pair is currently valued at $88.1 billion - a substantial figure that makes them among the most valuable companies in the world. Their price to earnings ratio ranges between 4 to 7, indicating that they are viewed as stable companies with few potentially explosive growth catalysts down the road."", ""On the other hand, Tesla's latest market value sits at a whopping $738 billion, nearly nine times the value of the two traditional car companies combined. This is a feat that many would have thought impossible when Tesla first attempted to make a car in the early 2000s. At the heart of Tesla's progress is its vehicle production and well built factories that are among the leading edge of their kind in the world. Making more cars allows Tesla to reduce their prices and capture more market, with one of the fundamental assumptions about its business model being that, unlike other companies who have to create demand for their products, the demand for electric vehicles already exists in substantial volumes."", ""Yet, despite the rosy outlook for the electric vehicle industry, 2023 has been quite tough on the industry. The year has been marked by high inflation and high interest rates, both of which aren't too great for high growth industries. High interest rates make it difficult to run everyday business operations and raise sufficient capital for any expansion plans while high inflation not only makes electric vehicles more expensive but also saps demand in a double whammy reinforcement cycle since manufacturers are also forced to raise prices at the same time to protect their margins."", ""These difficulties have manifested themselves during the tail end of 2023. One such development came in the form of GM and Honda withdrawing their $5 billion plan to develop electric vehicles together in October 2023. Their partnership, announced a couple of months earlier in April, was quite important for the electric vehicle industry since they were aiming to develop low cost EVs. These are necessary to break the world's dependence on internal combustion vehicles as price is one of the biggest limiting factors behind why firms like Tesla are unable to sell more cars."", 'Just as the car makers are suffering from a tough economy, demand for electric vehicles is also slowing. Data from Cox Automotive shows that between January and the start of October, the average days of inventory for electric vehicles jumped from 52 to peak at 111 days in July to slightly drop to 97 days in October. This means that dealerships are taking longer to sell electric vehicles, a crucial development that underscores the need to make cheaper EVs since the days of inventory for IC cars have remained stable this year.', ""So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at some top EV stocks to buy in 2024.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, whose ability to generate life like answers stunned both regular people and seasoned technology hands like Bill Gates. As it appeared that artificial intelligence is now ready to play a regular part in our lives, Wall Street aimed its guns at sectors that would benefit from it.', ""At the heart of investor attention was the semiconductor sector. ChatGPT is trained and powered by products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - the world's premier graphics processing unit (GPU) designer.

Of course back then it was reeling from a global supply slowdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and was yet to capitalize on the greater demand for technology products that the pandemic had ushered in. Similarly, NVIDIA is far from done, as its trailing twelve month revenue is $44.8 billion - marking a 66% growth over its latest fiscal quarter revenue.', ""NVIDIA's meteoric rise is also mirrored by the broader semiconductor industry.

Unlike NVIDIA, AMD also holds a license to make and sell x86 central processing unit (CPU) microprocessors. x86 products have been the backbone of personal computing, and AMD's Advancing AI event held in December 2023 saw it introduce a full package of A.I. products, ranging from CPUs, to GPUs, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

But She outlined that after taking a look at the market adoption of A.I. products, AMD now believes that the market is worth $45 billion in 2023 and will grow at a CAGR of 70% to be worth $400 billion by 2027."", ""Since A.I. and semiconductors are the hottest topics in the finance industry right now, here's what Fisher Investments' senior vice president Aaron Anderson had to say to Reuters' Elena Casas in a recent talk:"", ""Across the board for lots of different A.I. related companies, but certainly within semiconductors you've seen valuations expand. Although I will say you've seen growth pickup quite a big. Most of that valuation expansion has happened in the high end of semiconductor products. It's the fabless producers, and so forth, the designers for extremely in demand A.I. chips right now. And I think that by some measure they look expensive. You look at P/E ratios of some of the most prominent A.I. chip producers. You look a few years out, given what growth is projected to be, they don't look extremely expensive. Now you look at things such as price to sales and so forth, there maybe you could argue, there is a lot of optimism baked into them. But I think the fundamental tailwinds are real and a lot of these companies have got moats that are going to be very hard to compete with for coming years.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\xa0 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, among these, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow, a decision that includes personal computing but excludes eCommerce and social media from the list. Given that everyone spends all their time on social media and orders everything online, the Dow's exclusion does raise a question about its suitability as the economic barometer.

Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments. This is because, after a crucial U.S. jobs report that showed the economy adding 190,000 jobs in November (economists were expecting 175,000), the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ dropped by 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, shed 0.1% and led the two in the early stages of the reversal."", 'So, with the economic climate improving amidst doubts of a recession, we decided to see which Dow stocks are loved by billionaires.

The stock market ended November with an optimistic rally, putting most investors and financial experts in high spirits regarding the state of the market. At the same time, market forecasters are beginning to see the easing of inflation at this point in the year as well. On December 8, Jared Bernstein, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), was invited to CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' to discuss the inflation outlook for 2024. Here's what he had to say:"", '""So, the best indicator of inflation is inflation. Inflation in the PCE, which is the index the Fed watches most closely, was zero in October, and of course, the CPI is down about two-thirds off of its peak. And the reasons for that are, I think, pretty knowable. I wouldn\'t call it immaculate, I\'d call it a normalization of supply chains, helping to really take down goods inflation. We know that there\'s been some easing off of rents, and that enters the CPI with about a 10-month lag, so we\'re seeing that on the shelter part, and as the job market has cooled, and it has cooled, it\'s an important point here, we\'ve seen a slower nominal wage growth, and that means a lot for services inflation. So, the general forecast, if you talk to a market forecaster, is that this easing of inflation should continue.""', 'All in all, Bernstein seemed to be quite optimistic about the latest trends in the economy, particularly the latest jobs report and the state of inflation in the US at present.', ""Jan Hatzius, the Chief Economist and Head of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, also joined CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on December 8 to discuss his take on market expectations regarding pricing cuts and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the possibility of a recession. Here's what he had to say on the matter:"", '""The market is looking for cuts pretty early, March, at this point, is, you know, half-priced or so, and I think a lot would have to happen for them to go that soon. I think the key thing though, from a broader perspective, is that they can cut. If the economy were to see more of a slowdown than we expect, then the Fed could cut and provide some support, and that means the risk of recession is, in my view, quite low. We\'re at 15% over the next 12 months.""', 'When asked when he expects to see the first cut from the Fed, Hatzius said the following:', '""I think in the second half of the year is more realistic than in the first half, but again, it\'s going to depend on the data and they could respond to a slowdown more quickly. Or if inflation comes down even more quickly to the target than what we have in our forecast, they could also go somewhat earlier.""', 'The comments noted above highlight how the US economy may be moving in a more positive direction come 2024.

If you want to skip our overview of the mining industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Junior Silver Mining Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""The mining industry is essential for proper global economic functioning. Mining, whether it's for petroleum fuels or for metals and minerals, provides the essential raw materials for industrial production, construction, electronics, agriculture, and other crucial sectors."", ""Within mining, oil and metals play a particularly important role. Oil's role is self-explanatory due to the world's reliance on petroleum fuels for transportation and power generation. Similarly, metals and minerals are used in a variety of industries as they enable industrial firms to make large and small scale engineered products."", 'One metal that is important in both the finance and engineering industries is silver. While not as lustrous as gold, silver still provides investors with an opportunity to buffer their money against inflation. At the same time, it is also used in a variety of industries such as solar panels and electric vehicles. What this means is that the price of silver - and the revenue of silver companies by extension - depends on global industrial and financial conditions. When the demand for safe haven assets is high and rates are low, silver prices rise. Similarly, when economic conditions are robust and industrial output is booming, silver prices see similar tailwinds.', ""Looking at this, it's no surprise that silver prices continued to rise as December began. November was a great month for the stock market as investors brought forward their bets for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This also means a weaker dollar as holding the greenback isn't as lucrative if interest rates are lower. Naturally, this was a boon for gold and silver prices, with silver in particular rising for three consecutive weeks to trade at a six month high of $25.47 per ounce."", 'Moving over to the industrial uses cases of silver, the metal benefits from high demand from solar panel manufacturers. While copper is widely known for its conductive properties, silver is widely thought to be the best conductor in the world. This makes it suitable for solar panel use, and silver works together with silicon in a solar panel to conduct electricity by carrying the silicon electrons to batteries after they are energized by sunlight hitting the panel.', ""This crucial use case that sits right at the heart of the world's renewable energy efforts is believed by several quarters to be a strong catalyst for silver demand. While solar panel manufacturers have decreased the amount of silver used per panel due to technological advancements, its electrochemical properties mean that the metal is indispensable when it comes to making the panels. Data shows that the percentage of demand for solar panels as a percentage of total silver demand is expected to grow from 5% in 2014 to nearly triple in percentage terms by the end of this year to 14%. In absolute terms, the amount of silver used in solar panels could grow by a whopping 169% by 2030 to sit at 273 million ounces per gigwatt in 2023."", 'The impact of this growing demand on silver companies is two fold. For starters, naturally, their market will grow and they will find more areas to sell their products in. However, at the same time, the sector will also have to significantly increase its output to ensure that demand stays in line with supply and does not outpace it. This also means that should they decide to invest heavily in new production sites, then the set up costs to bring mines online can lead to bottom line stress during the period that the mines are being developed and not producing the shiny metal.', ""To understand the impact that optimizing mines can have on a silver company's production, consider the comments made by the management of Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE:EXK) during its latest fiscal quarter earnings call:"", 'While this quarter’s results still put us on track to be within this year’s production guidance range, there’s a little room for setback in Q4. Guanaceví’s production shortfall is due to a number of factors. If you recall, we discussed initiating changes to our mine plan and infrastructure to improve working conditions for our employees by providing better ventilation and improving our water management. To address these conditions, we temporarily changed mine sequencing. This meant mining lower silver and gold grade stopes until we sufficiently address the temperatures and the water in blows lower in our mine. Ultimately, these issues could have been better managed to prevent impacts on production. Simultaneously increased sill development during Q3 to open more stopes further impacted Q3’s mine outlook.', 'Sequencing of sill development will continue to be a focus for Guanaceví to ensure a stable production schedule going forward near term and long term. While the temporary changes have lasted longer than we anticipated, conditions have improved and mine output has increased. With the conditions within the mine, management felt it was an appropriate opportunity for an extended plant shutdown to address areas within the plant requiring more time than our standard maintenance shutdowns. Considerable maintenance work is performed in all areas of the plant, including crushing, grinding, thickeners and the filter press to ensure we maintain consistent throughput going forward and alleviate risks that could result in unplanned downturn. With the plant maintenance completed in early October, both the mine and the plant are operating at or above capacity.', 'The combination of these events during the third quarter resulted in quarterly silver gold production decreasing by 22% and 13%, respectively. It equates to a production shortfall of nearly 400,000 ounces of silver compared to previous quarters and our annual mine plan.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top junior silver mining stocks.

What makes these coins earn their current-day sales prices comes down to how many coins were originally produced throughout their mintage, as well as how many are currently still accounted for. The materials and composition of the coins also add to their value since many have become precious and hard to find themselves.', 'Take, for example, the 1792 Silver Center Cent J-1. It was originally worth 1 cent — the penny of its day — when it was initially minted and subsequently released to the American public. The composition was primarily copper surrounding a silver center. Not only do these unique qualities add to its value, but the fact that the coin has a special strike from a pattern the United States Mint designed in 1792 and then began testing in 1793.

The year has been full of ups and downs for the stock market, and throughout these past 12 months, investors have watched their investments go up and come down as they scuttle to adjust portfolios on the slightest of whims. 2023 started out by greeting a market that was wary of the Federal Reserve and its interest rate hikes. The Fed, for its part, had entered 2023 by raising rates multiple times by 75 basis points each, and investors, analysts, and economists were worried about the impact of these rates on the economy and particularly high growth technology sectors."", 'While the stock market itself is an economic barometer, indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 often see their performance varies by sector. For instance, last year as technology and growth companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were decimated due to high rates and inflation denting their markets, others such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) soared on the back of record high oil prices.', ""One index that is a better representation of the American economy is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). One of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow has seen all phases of the stock market's history - from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession in 2008. Throughout its life, it has seen numerous companies come and go, and since technology is the biggest sector of the American economy now, several technology companies are now present on the Dow.

(NYSE:PFE), Exxon, and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were given the boot."", ""Since the Dow is more diversified, its performance doesn't often see breakneck returns like other indexes such as the tech heavy NASDAQ 100. The index's constituents range from financial services to information technology, petroleum exploration, healthcare, retail, construction, semiconductors, and entertainment. So for instance, if semiconductors continue to rise on the back of strong A.I. spending but construction contracts should rates remain high, then the Dow's performance will reflect both these fluctuations. As a consequence, the Dow is up by a modest 9.12% year to date, while other widely known indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have gained 19.8% and 37.98%, respectively."", ""So, the Dow isn't known for blockbuster returns. This should make one wonder why is it so popular among investors and the media? Well, the answer to this question lies in two words: stability and diversification. Should one simply choose to invest in the index, then while the portfolio won't generate high returns, it would nevertheless prove to be a great buffer during economic turmoil. As an example of this principle, consider that between December 2007 and June 2009, the S&P 500 lost roughly 40% -\xa0 a disaster that shook the world. However, the DJIA pared off slightly better, as it prevented some of the losses to be down by roughly 35%.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Walt Disney’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' View our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Walt Disney today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $105.06, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Walt Disney. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in DIS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DIS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you'd like to know more about Walt Disney as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Walt Disney and we think they deserve your attention."", 'If you are no longer interested in Walt Disney, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Another thing to keep in mind is that DENTSPLY SIRONA’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.

The company will be called QXO, Inc.', '“QXO’s strategy is to create a tech-forward leader in the building products distribution industry through accretive M&A and organic growth, including greenfield openings, with the goal of generating outsized stockholder value,” Jacobs said. Jacobs will become chairman and chief executive officer of QXO upon closing a previously announced $1 billion cash investment into SilverSun Technologies, Inc. After spinning off the existing SilverSun business, the remaining company, QXO, will be a standalone platform for significant acquisitions.', 'Distributors of building products offer materials, finished goods, value-added solutions and expertise to a broad range of customers across residential, nonresidential, industrial and infrastructure end-markets. Their products are used in new construction and in repair and remodeling. Key categories include access control, construction supplies, doors and windows, electrical components, fencing and decking, HVAC, infrastructure, landscaping, lumber, plumbing, pools, roofing, siding and water, among others.', '“We expect to achieve a revenue run-rate of at least $1 billion by the end of year one, at least $5 billion within three years, and tens of billions of dollars over the next decade,” Jacobs said. “QXO’s scale should elevate the customer experience, increase sales force effectiveness and enable margin expansion.”', 'The industry’s nascent use of technology, particularly AI and B2B e-commerce, represents a compelling opportunity for tech-focused entrants. According to industry data, the percentage of industry revenue derived from e-commerce is currently only mid-single digits, and this share is expected to triple by 2030. Additional types of tech adoption by distributors have the potential to be transformative through price optimization, demand forecasting, warehouse automation and robotics, automated inventory management, route optimization for delivery fleets, supply chain visibility, and end-to-end digital customer connectivity. QXO’s strategy anticipates that these drivers, among others, will be central to the company’s goal of outsized stockholder value creation.', 'The building products distribution industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 7,000 distributors in North America and 13,000 in Europe, according to industry observers. The industry has generated compound annual revenue growth of 7% over the last five years, based on industry data, and continues to benefit from powerful secular growth drivers for building products distribution in the residential, nonresidential and infrastructure sectors.', ""For example, industry reports estimate that the current supply of U.S. homes is 3 million units short of demand, potentially creating long-term tailwinds for both new construction and the repair and remodeling of aging homes. In the nonresidential sector, long-term demand is expected to be driven by growth across multiple industrial and commercial verticals, according to industry sources. Infrastructure should benefit from the widely reported need for repair or replacement of America's public transportation, utility and communication systems, among others."", 'These market dynamics, together with the fragmented nature of the industry, offer a significant opportunity to unlock growth potential through scale and technology. National distributors can serve large customers across multiple geographies and project types with standardized efficiencies, providing consistent, data-driven customer services across a broad operating scope. Additionally, a scaled technology ecosystem can expand the array of value-added services offered to customers, such as jobsite visibility into product consumption, digital configuration tools for custom ordering and tracking, and virtual design capabilities that interface with product order flow.', 'Track record', 'Brad Jacobs has completed approximately 500 M&A transactions in his career, and built five multibillion-dollar, publicly traded companies to date: XPO, Inc. (NYSE: XPO), one of the largest providers of less-than-truckload services in North America; GXO Logistics, Inc. (NYSE: GXO), the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world; RXO, Inc. (NYSE: RXO), a leading tech-enabled freight brokerage platform; United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), the world’s largest equipment rental company; and United Waste Systems, Inc., the fifth largest U.S. waste management company at the time of its sale.', 'Each of these companies has a history of attracting world-class talent, establishing advantages through technology, and scaling up through accretive capital allocations for M&A and organic growth.', 'This decades-long track record should position QXO to acquire exceptional businesses, integrate them effectively, improve margins and generate high returns on capital.', 'The Investment Agreement', 'As previously announced, on December 3, 2023, Jacobs Private Equity II, LLC (“JPE”), which is led by Brad Jacobs, and minority co-investors entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with SilverSun Technologies, Inc.

The proposed investment is comprised of $900 million by JPE and $100 million by co-investors, including Sequoia Heritage.', 'Upon the closing of the equity investment, JPE will become SilverSun’s majority stockholder, Jacobs will become its chairman and chief executive officer, and SilverSun will be renamed QXO.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Public Storage's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PSA.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'Public Storage is the largest owner of self-storage facilities in the U.S. with more than 2,880 self-storage facilities in 40 states and approximately 200 million square feet of rentable space. Through equity interests, it also has exposure to the European self-storage market through Shurgard Self Storage. The company also has a merchandise business, a third-party property management business, and an insurance business that offers products to cover losses for the goods in self-storage facilities.', 'Public Storage has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1985. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Public Storage has increased its dividend each year since 1992. The stock is thus listed as a dividend aristocrat, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 31 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, Public Storage currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.02% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.38%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. And over the past decade, Public Storage's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 5.90%. Based on Public Storage's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Public Storage stock as of today is approximately 4.02%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, Public Storage's dividend payout ratio is 1.01, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable."", ""Public Storage's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Public Storage's profitability 9 out of 10 as of 2023-09-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Public Storage's growth rank of 9 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Public Storage's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Public Storage's revenue has increased by approximately 13.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 87.6% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Public Storage's earnings increased by approximately 23.00% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 78.24% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 10.90%, which outperforms approximately 75.14% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, while Public Storage's recent dividend announcement is a sign of its commitment to returning value to shareholders, the high payout ratio might raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of such payments. However, considering Public Storage's strong profitability rank and robust growth metrics, the company appears to be in a favorable position to maintain its dividend aristocrat status. Investors should consider both the potential for future dividend growth and the need for the company to balance shareholder returns with reinvestment in the business. As always, it is advisable to look at the full financial picture and not just the dividend metrics when making investment decisions.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the allure of Mexico for expats and retirees, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Mexico on a Budget of $2000 a Month.', 'Home to more than 2 million expats from around the world, Mexico stands out as a popular destination. According to the US Department of State, an estimated 1.6 million US citizens have chosen the country as their place of residence. Beyond its appeal to international residents, Mexico is also a prime choice for foreign investors, particularly those eyeing the real estate market. Foreign expats, especially retirees who wish to make Mexico their permanent abode, consider it more cost-effective to either rent or own property here.', 'This is especially true for American citizens, many of whom have already given up on the idea of owning a home back in the States. According to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), the median price of a home in America as of October 2023 is $413,504. Based on these figures, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) report highlights that a typical American household owns $40,000 less than the income needed to own a medium-sized house.', '“Buyers–particularly first-timers–who are committed to getting into a home now should think outside the box. Consider a condo or townhouse, which are less expensive than a single-family home, and/or consider moving to a more affordable part of the country, or a more affordable suburb.”', '-Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao.', 'Forbes, aligning with Chen Zhao, also advocates for considering affordable living but specifically points to countries like Mexico. According to Mexico Business News, houses acquired in Mexico through a mortgage loan averaged prices of over MX$1.6 million (US$93,800) in Q2 2023, up 11.5% from Q2 2022. Within the metropolitan areas, the Valley of Mexico witnessed an increase of 10.9%, Guadalajara by 12.5%, and Monterrey by 11.3%. Despite the rising prices, housing in Mexico remains significantly more affordable for US expats compared to the United States. Foreigners, especially retirees, can consider buying a home in this country and spending a comfortable retirement here.', 'Spending one’s golden years in a different country can be a grand experience. In particular, there are many advantages of living in Mexico as an expat retiree. From the pleasant year-round weather to the large expat community and reasonable cost of living, life is simple and relaxed . In America, a typical retiree spends $4,345 on average, whereas the cost of living in Mexico for a single person can vary between $600 to $2,000 a month.', 'Many expats report living comfortably in many areas of Mexico for $1,500 a month as well. The country can be pretty easy to live in. Expats in Mexico feel pretty much ""at home"", thanks to the large expat community. American chains such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) can also be found here in the country. There is McDonald\'s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Burger King, Del Taco, and Baja Fresh, to name a few. All in all, expat retirees report having the time of their lives.', ""However, retiring overseas isn't as simple as it may seem. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), a good deal of preparation can help expats ensure a smooth transition."", '""I advise clients to get the ball rolling as early as possible, as there are several big items you\'ll need to check off your list to ensure a smooth transition.""', '-George Lee, CFP®, CWS®, director at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Asset Management.', 'To retire in Mexico, expats can begin by applying for a temporary resident visa. For visa approval, they need to provide a sufficient source of income outside of Mexico. The minimum monthly requirement is estimated to be $1,620. Those granted a temporary visa can live in the country for four years. In case they wish to live longer, a permanent visa needs to be applied for. Once a resident, the first concern of an expat is finances. Institutions such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) make it easier for expats to conduct transactions outside the States.', 'Potential expats should note that there are a few disadvantages to living in Mexico as well. First, retirees are better off living in the country if they learn Spanish. Even though there are many places where almost every other local is bilingual, learning the language can help get by more easily. Second, foreigners must keep a lookout for scams. From taxi scams to timeshare and even ATM skimming, a lot can happen if one is not careful. Lastly, even though the country is significantly cheaper than the US, there are lot of imported items and luxuries that cost at least 30% more than what one would find in the States.', 'Simon Dannhauer/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of best places to retire in Mexico on a budget of $2,000 a month, we began by searching for the best places on expat forums, Reddit, Quora, and websites such as International Living, Mexico Relocation Guide, etc. Next, we filtered out the places where living on a budget of $2,000 a month isn’t possible.', 'To determine the cost of living, we relied on Nomads List cost of living data, as well as used recent data based on actual expat experiences. The average monthly rents are discussed for a one-bedroom apartment in the city/town center, while the monthly cost of living is discussed for an individual retiree. Finally, a consensus approach was used to select the places, with one point awarded to each place each time it was recommended by a source. Scores were summed up and places were ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'For places with same scores, tie-breaking has been done based on cost of living, with the place with the lower cost of living ranking higher on our list.', 'Here are the best places to retire in Mexico on a budget of $2,000 a month:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 5 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $520', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $1,500\xa0\xa0 ', 'Ensenada offers the perfect beach-town vibe to retirees seeking a pleasant yet fulfilling retirement.

This city in east-central Mexico is revered for its rich cultural history and architectural style. The climate here is moderate with low humidity, making it pleasant to live in.

Querétaro has a well-preserved historic center brimming with cafes, restaurants, and many markets. There are modern neighborhoods available on the outskirts that have American-style homes. Many expats choose to live in these.

The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, located close to this town, is the second-largest coral reef system in the world.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 9 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $550', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $2,000', ""If you’re thinking of moving to Huatulco for good, it's best to let the winters pass and get yourself a good rental deal in the summer.

Warm weather, reasonable cost of living, and diverse marine life make it one of the best places to retire in Mexico."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 11 ', 'Average Monthly Rent: $504', 'Average Monthly Cost of Living: $1,080', 'One of the safest and cheapest states to retire in Mexico is Oaxaca. Oaxaca City, in particular, offers retirees the best of both worlds — an abundance of big-city amenities combined with the inviting charm of a small-town atmosphere.

Take Warren Buffett, for example. He's a strong advocate for dividend stocks and consistently incorporates a wide range of these equities into his investment portfolio each quarter. According to a Wall Street Journal article, Berkshire Hathaway is projected to get $5.7 billion in dividends for 2023. It's a given that when companies experience surging profits, it translates into immense wealth for the wealthiest individuals. Ownership of shares tends to be concentrated among those with higher incomes. For instance, in the US, the richest 1% own more than half of all shares. Sometimes, these prosperous companies are owned and managed by a small cluster of billionaire individuals and families. As profits grow, so does their wealth. Consider the Walton family, who controls half of Walmart, a major US retailer. In 2022 alone, they received a staggering $8.5 billion from dividends and buybacks, contributing significantly to their already substantial wealth, according to a paper published by Oxfam."", ""Billionaires' keen interest in dividend stocks stems from the impressive track record these stocks have displayed in the past. Their performance has been robust, showcasing consistent growth and stability over time. Dividends have been a significant part of investors' gains over the last 50 years. Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total profit from the S&P 500 Index comes from reinvested dividends and the multiplying effect of compound interest."", ""Dividend stocks have caught investors' interest primarily because of their enticing dividend yield, which is the percentage of annual dividends compared to a stock's price. However, some studies have revealed an intriguing trend that stocks boasting high dividend yields haven't performed as well over the long term as those consistently increasing their dividends. As per a ProShares report, in the last five periods of increasing interest rates since 2005, dividend growth has consistently performed better than high dividend yield by an average of around 4%. This suggests that focusing on companies with a history of steadily increasing their dividends might be a reliable strategy across various market conditions, regardless of changes in interest rates."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the Dow, then you can skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Least. "", ""Even though 2023 is ready to race away into the past, one parting gift that it's given investors is uncertainty. The year has been full of ups and downs for the stock market, and throughout these past 12 months, investors have watched their investments go up and come down as they scuttle to adjust portfolios on the slightest of whims. 2023 started out by greeting a market that was wary of the Federal Reserve and its interest rate hikes. The Fed, for its part, had entered 2023 by raising rates multiple times by 75 basis points each, and investors, analysts, and economists were worried about the impact of these rates on the economy and particularly high growth technology sectors."", 'While the stock market itself is an economic barometer, indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 often see their performance varies by sector. For instance, last year as technology and growth companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were decimated due to high rates and inflation denting their markets, others such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) soared on the back of record high oil prices.', ""One index that is a better representation of the American economy is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). One of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow has seen all phases of the stock market's history - from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession in 2008. Throughout its life, it has seen numerous companies come and go, and since technology is the biggest sector of the American economy now, several technology companies are now present on the Dow. Being a member allows a firm to take the prestigious title of a blue chip stock, and right now, the Dow is made of 30 companies with the latest changes having taken place in 2020 when Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) made the cut and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Exxon, and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were given the boot."", ""Since the Dow is more diversified, its performance doesn't often see breakneck returns like other indexes such as the tech heavy NASDAQ 100. The index's constituents range from financial services to information technology, petroleum exploration, healthcare, retail, construction, semiconductors, and entertainment. So for instance, if semiconductors continue to rise on the back of strong A.I. spending but construction contracts should rates remain high, then the Dow's performance will reflect both these fluctuations. As a consequence, the Dow is up by a modest 9.12% year to date, while other widely known indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have gained 19.8% and 37.98%, respectively."", ""So, the Dow isn't known for blockbuster returns. This should make one wonder why is it so popular among investors and the media? Well, the answer to this question lies in two words: stability and diversification. Should one simply choose to invest in the index, then while the portfolio won't generate high returns, it would nevertheless prove to be a great buffer during economic turmoil. As an example of this principle, consider that between December 2007 and June 2009, the S&P 500 lost roughly 40% -\xa0 a disaster that shook the world. However, the DJIA pared off slightly better, as it prevented some of the losses to be down by roughly 35%.

Growth investing aims at identifying stocks that show promising potential for higher-than-average earnings growth. On the other hand, value investing centers on stocks perceived to be priced lower than their true or intrinsic value. After underperforming in 2022, growth shares have surged impressively this year, reclaiming attention with remarkable gains, whereas value shares have struggled to maintain momentum. This significant market fluctuation has made it difficult for investors to maintain confidence in long-term investment strategies, given the notable volatility experienced. The iShares S&P 500 Value ETF, which provides exposure to large U.S. companies that are potentially undervalued relative to comparable companies, gained 16.25% this year so far, compared with a 25.58% return of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF.', 'Despite the recent underperformance of value stocks, analysts remain unfazed and hold an optimistic outlook on this investment style. Their confidence is rooted in the historically strong performance of value stocks in the past. Aaron Dunn, co-head of value equity at Eaton Vance, spoke with Bloomberg about the outlook of value stocks this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“Over the last three years, value investing has kept up and actually beaten its growth peers. So, value investing is very interesting in a market like this, because we believe active management and looking for undervalued securities is the key to long-term success.\xa0 Last year was a great example of the benefits of diversification through value investing. We have a view that inflation and interest rates are going to be structurally higher and what that means is if you go back to prior decades of the 1940s and the 1970s, value investing actually did extremely well over that period.”', ""Analysts believe that value stocks tend to fare relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors tend to become more risk-averse and cautious about their investments. As a result, they often turn to stocks that are considered more resilient or stable, which often includes value stocks. \xa0A GMO report analyzed how cheaper stocks performed during U.S. recessions since 1969 using various valuation models like price/book, price/earnings, Composite Value, and a blend of value models for their Opportunistic Value strategies. The report suggests that building portfolios solely based on standard price/book or price/earnings ratios isn't recommended by the firm. However, even if an investor insisted on using these ratios, they generally performed reasonably well during recessions over the past 55 years. Surprisingly, all value models, except for price/book, showed better performance during recession months (including the COVID period) compared to non-recession months since the late 1960s."", 'When delving into value investing, investors often pay attention not only to value stocks but also to value dividend stocks.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.

Doudna and Charpentier found that bacteria were leaving detailed clues about this warfare technology through clustered and repeated sequences of genetic code.In 2020, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of the CRISPR/Cas9 “genetic scissors.” Cas is short for “CRISPR-associated” and used to designate the different enzymes involved with a particular gene.In a special edition of Zacks Confidential tonight I’ll be doing a deeper dive on the dynamic duo of CRISPR. And I’ll also be discussing at least four other stocks that are the best ways to play the CRISPR revolution. Right now, let’s look at the news and the numbers that sparked an 80%+ rally in CRSP shares in November.The FDA Approval LandmarkI have been an investor in CRISPR stocks since 2017 when I launched my Healthcare Innovators portfolio service. And to say it\'s been a bumpy road -- for both the R&D and the stocks -- would be putting it lightly. (That\'s to say nothing of the legal and patent battles over the science which are sure to come back around.)Gene editing is scary to many people, and word of rogue experiments in China didn’t help its public reputation for the approval of clinical trials. I recall holding shares of Editas Medicine (EDIT) for round-trips between $20 and $90 -- twice!I tried to hang on through the ups and the downs, believing the bigger medical breakthroughs and inevitable stock breakout would come (with fingers crossed). Alas, as investors we instead entered a long ""CRISPR winter.""The great news is that the dedicated R&D work of scientists and medical professionals stayed warm and fruitful during these years. And thankfully I was buying both EDIT and CRSP near their lows in 2023.CRISPR Therapeutics Gets the First Green LightCRSP is currently a Zacks #2 Rank Buy as EPS estimates have climbed over 30% in the past two months because over a dozen covering analysts raised the consensus loss for this year from -$4.83 to -$3.27.I now expect estimates for next year to also rise significantly after this historic approval, and push the stock into the upper deck of the Zacks Rank.So what made the FDA launch this landmark leap for gene-editing and bring such a controversial science to the medical marketplace?First, on October 31, an FDA Advisory Committee panel met to discuss the risks and benefits of the investigational treatment ""exa-cel"" (exagamglogene autotemcel) from CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and its ""big brother"" partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).Exa-cel was designed and tested in clinical trials to treat two debilitating blood disorders, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.The FDA challenge: One of the unique hurdles for CRISPR technologies is the potential for ""off-target"" edits of other genes that could be turned off, replaced, altered or eliminated. And this was one of the primary themes of the meeting of the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies AdCom.The FDA opportunity: An FDA green light would make exa-cel the first approved drug using CRISPR and could offer a permanent solution for patients with severe SCD, a genetic disorder where red blood cells morph into a collapsed “sickle” shape that makes it difficult for them to travel in the bloodstream.From the NIH website on Sickle Cell Disease...SCD is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that affect hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the body. Normally, red blood cells are disc-shaped and flexible enough to move easily through the blood vessels. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells become crescent- or “sickle”-shaped due to a genetic mutation. These sickled red blood cells do not bend or move easily and can block blood flow to the rest of the body.Bottom line on FDA AdCom: The panel agreed that there were theoretical off-target edit risks for exa-cel, but overall it was unanimous that its efficacy benefit outweighs that risk. While this was not a formal FDA approval (just an Advisory Committee) the news was very encouraging and gave several Wall Street analysts, many of whom are either MDs or PhDs in the life sciences, greater confidence in an eventual FDA approval.Following the Oct 31 AdCom, Truist analysts led by Dr. Joon Lee reiterated their $220 price target on CRSP shares as they envision strong physician support and sales for Casgevy (the commercial name for exa-cel) once it hits the market.Then, on November 16 after a 2-week 50% rally in CRSP shares, the UK became the first national health regulator to approve Casgevy. Here’s what I told investors in my Healthcare Innovators portfolio where we bought CRSP again in the $40s...CRISPR Goes Boom!Healthcare InvestorBig News: The first CRISPR treatment has been approved!We\'ve been waiting a long time for this and the setbacks have been numerous. But this marks the early innings of what could become a very profitable field to invest in.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) won UK conditional marketing authorization for their Casgevy gene therapy, marking the world\'s first approval of a drug using the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR.The companies announced on Thursday that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) of the United Kingdom has granted conditional marketing authorization to their CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy, Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel, or ""exa-cel"") for treating two debilitating blood disorders, sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).Pressure on the FDA... and on Insurance PayersWhile the FDA had already set a decision date of December 8 for Casgevy in SCD, the Nov 16 approval from the UK put some added pressure on US regulators.Then there is the pricing issue as these new gene therapies are expensive and require intense rounds of treatment. In Europe, insurance companies have resisted the need to pay for therapies costing over $1 million per patient.And this proposed treatment is particularly complex as it involves extracting blood stem cells from a patient\'s bone marrow, editing those cells in the lab ex vivo (outside the body), and then infusing them back into the patient\'s body. This ex vivo approach is considered less risky because it can avoid off-target edits to other genes. But this complex treatment regime also includes chemotherapy and patients must be hospitalized for a month or possibly longer.On Friday after the FDA announcement, Vertex and CRISPR revealed the price tag for the Casgevy treatment in SCD: $2.2 million. The market reaction by CRSP investors, after a pre-FDA spike on Friday above $75 to 16-month highs, was a classic “sell the news” back down to the mid-$60s. But volume was enormous at 17 million shares and that told me buyers were coming in off the lows near $62.More important than investor reaction right now, for me anyway, was the response of one Nobel laureate with a huge stake in the development of CRISPR science into actual medicines. In her 2017 book, A Crack In Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, she took a strong ethical stand on the power of technologies such as CRISPR to be misused. Here’s what she had to say upon the FDA approval of Casgevy...""Going from the lab to an approved CRISPR therapy in just 11 years is a truly remarkable achievement,"" Doudna said, adding she was especially pleased that the approval helps patients with ""a disease that has long been neglected by the medical establishment.""Writing for Genetic Engineering & Technology News, Kevin Davies, PhD. shared this perspective...It is ironic that the first approved CRISPR therapy -- a technology barely ten years old -- should be for the genetic disorder that Linus Pauling famously dubbed ""the first molecular disease"" almost 75 years ago.Davies, author of the 2020 book Editing Humanity: The CRISPR Revolution and the New Era of Genome Editing, also highlighted other voices who’ve been pointing out the neglect for SCD patients...But despite these scientific milestones, the experience of SCD patients has not advanced to the same degree. As the late science journalist Sharon Begley put it plainly: ""The U.S. healthcare system is killing adults with sickle cell disease."" And while FDA approval of Casgevy is a moment for celebration, this approach won’t help the vast majority of patients worldwide. As Dhruv Khullar wrote in the New Yorker: ""If we truly want to cure sickle-cell disease, editing genomes will only get us so far. We’ll need to rewrite our medical system, too.""Casgevy, Sickle Cell, and the Future of CRISPRApproximately 100,000 people in the US have sickle cell disease (SCD), of mostly African-American descent, and more than 20 million people globally are afflicted.Vertex and CRISPR say they hope to help the 20,000 Americans with the most severe cases of SCD who are willing to take the long road of complex treatment and cost hurdles to potentially transform their lives.As always with debilitating disease and potential cures that offer both promise and risk, it helps to look at the individual stories of patients and their families that transform all the hard numbers into real faces.I’ve heard at least three of these heart-wrenching stories in the past few months. In a Friday piece for the Wall Street Journal by Joseph Walker, FDA Approves World\'s First Crispr Gene-Editing Drug for Sickle-Cell Disease, he highlighted the story of a woman named Marie Tornyenu who had to be hospitalized sometimes and got monthly transfusions of healthy blood from a donor. Walker described how Tornyenu lived in fear of the bouts of extreme pain in her hips and legs that felt like a ""dull ache that just burns and gets exponentially worse.""Knowing some of the forthcoming risks of the necessary chemotherapy, she began receiving Casgevy treatments in a clinical trial in 2021 after undergoing fertility treatment to preserve her eggs in case she wanted to have children in the future. After a few months, she was in a resurggence where not only the pain was gone but also the effecs of chemo.Walker writes...For the first time, she could take a walk around her neighborhood without getting fatigued. ""I still thought about, \'What if I have pain?\'"" said Tornyenu, 22 years old, of Bethlehem, Pa. ""But the pain never came.""Bottom line on CRSP: The breakthrough medical miracles should continue and open up all kinds of paths for CRISPR technology to make life better for millions of people with other “incurable” genetic diseases.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. For this reason, Textron's five year net income decline of 3.1% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""So, as a next step, we compared Textron's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 4.8% over the last few years."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.

This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""In addition, Textron has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 2.0% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Textron's future ROE will rise to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Textron has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth.

We note that for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners the TSR over the last 3 years was 69%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's good to see that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 20% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners ."", 'If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Dutch exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Chronic GVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue3.', 'About Axatilimab', 'Axatilimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of signaling through the CSF-1 receptor has been shown to reduce the number of disease-mediating macrophages along with their monocyte precursors, which has been shown to play a key role in the fibrotic disease process underlying diseases such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Phase 1/2 data of axatilimab in chronic GVHD demonstrating its broad activity and tolerability were last presented at the 63rd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and data were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Additionally, positive topline results from the Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial showing the trial met its primary endpoint were recently announced. Axatilimab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD and IPF.

Axatilimab is being developed under an exclusive worldwide license from UCB entered into between Syndax and UCB in 2016.', 'About AGAVE-201', ""The global Phase 2 AGAVE-201 dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of axatilimab in 241 adult and pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory active chronic GVHD whose disease had progressed after two prior therapies. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups that investigated a distinct dose of axatilimab administered at 0.3 mg/kg every two weeks, 1.0 mg/kg every two weeks or 3.0 mg/kg every four weeks. The trial's primary endpoint is the proportion of patients in each dose group who achieved an objective response as defined by 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria for chronic GVHD by cycle 7 day 1.

According to a Wall Street Journal article, Berkshire Hathaway is projected to get $5.7 billion in dividends for 2023. It's a given that when companies experience surging profits, it translates into immense wealth for the wealthiest individuals. Ownership of shares tends to be concentrated among those with higher incomes. For instance, in the US, the richest 1% own more than half of all shares. Sometimes, these prosperous companies are owned and managed by a small cluster of billionaire individuals and families. As profits grow, so does their wealth. Consider the Walton family, who controls half of Walmart, a major US retailer. In 2022 alone, they received a staggering $8.5 billion from dividends and buybacks, contributing significantly to their already substantial wealth, according to a paper published by Oxfam."", ""Billionaires' keen interest in dividend stocks stems from the impressive track record these stocks have displayed in the past.

Looking at the period since 1960, about 69% of the total profit from the S&P 500 Index comes from reinvested dividends and the multiplying effect of compound interest."", ""Dividend stocks have caught investors' interest primarily because of their enticing dividend yield, which is the percentage of annual dividends compared to a stock's price. However, some studies have revealed an intriguing trend that stocks boasting high dividend yields haven't performed as well over the long term as those consistently increasing their dividends. As per a ProShares report, in the last five periods of increasing interest rates since 2005, dividend growth has consistently performed better than high dividend yield by an average of around 4%.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\xa0 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, among these, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow, a decision that includes personal computing but excludes eCommerce and social media from the list. Given that everyone spends all their time on social media and orders everything online, the Dow's exclusion does raise a question about its suitability as the economic barometer.

Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments. This is because, after a crucial U.S. jobs report that showed the economy adding 190,000 jobs in November (economists were expecting 175,000), the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ dropped by 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, shed 0.1% and led the two in the early stages of the reversal."", 'So, with the economic climate improving amidst doubts of a recession, we decided to see which Dow stocks are loved by billionaires.

If you don't want to learn more about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), its history, and recent performance, then skip ahead to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Like The Most. "", 'In its current form today, the Dow is made up of 30 companies. These firms are also called blue chip stocks, and the Dow was expanded to include 30 companies right at a time of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. This took place in 1928 and the term was coined by a news reporter working for Dow Jones. In 1928, the stock market entered its eighth consecutive year of a bull run, and naturally, there was optimism (and money) flowing all around. However, this was followed by the Great Depression, an economic calamity that delivered 15x worse percentage losses than the Great Recession that followed the housing bubble pop in 2008.', ""Since its inception, the Dow has seen it all. Originally a classification of 12 stocks prior to its expansion in 1928, the index has been rebalanced along the way to ensure that it paints an accurate picture of the U.S. economy. Its century long history has also seen several firms stay on the index for decades. For instance, the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), one of the oldest companies in America, was part of the Dow's original collection of 12 stocks and remained on the index continuously since 1907 until it was given the boot in 2018. General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and the pharmacy retailer has held its place at the time of writing."", ""Yet, despite being one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow still has its limitations. For instance, while the index is designed to be a broad representation of the U.S. economy, the stock market landscape is dominated by the 'Magnificent Seven'. These are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\xa0 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, among these, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow, a decision that includes personal computing but excludes eCommerce and social media from the list. Given that everyone spends all their time on social media and orders everything online, the Dow's exclusion does raise a question about its suitability as the economic barometer.

Well, November was a great month for the index as investors became all bright eyed about potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. As December 2023 started, the DJIA added 2.4% during the last week of November to mark a fifth week of consecutive gain to beat its previous similar run in 2021. This streak came after July 2023 which had seen the blue chip stock index post 13 consecutive days of gains - a feat that it had previously achieved in 1987. Just like the November rally, the July record was also due to the Federal Reserve as investors jumped on the optimism gun after the Fed signaled that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle."", ""The start of December 2023's second week also showed why the Dow is more preferred when it comes to protecting investments. This is because, after a crucial U.S. jobs report that showed the economy adding 190,000 jobs in November (economists were expecting 175,000), the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ dropped by 10 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. The Dow, on the other hand, shed 0.1% and led the two in the early stages of the reversal."", 'So, with the economic climate improving amidst doubts of a recession, we decided to see which Dow stocks are loved by billionaires.
