The company has been offering commission-free trading, which has led to a rise in client assets and brokerage accounts. Further, higher interest rates will aid margin growth.Analysts seem optimistic regarding the company’s earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s current-year earnings has been revised 1.9% upward over the last 30 days.However, because of the company’s inorganic growth efforts, expenses are expected to remain elevated, thus hurting profits to an extent. Thus, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of SCHW have gained 16.8% compared with the industry’s 8% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Looking at its fundamentals, Schwab’s net interest margin (NIM) is expected to improve in the quarters ahead. NIM declined from 2.41% in 2019 to 1.62% in 2020 and to 1.45% in 2021. Nevertheless, as rates increased, the company’s NIM improved to 1.78% in 2022, with the uptrend continuing in the first six months of 2023.With the Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates high in the near term, the company’s margins will likely be positively impacted. Management expects NIM to reach the 210-bps range by the fourth quarter of 2023. We project the company's NIM to be 2.07% in 2023, 2.47% in 2024 and 2.93% in 2025.Moreover, Schwab continues to benefit from aggressive efforts to increase client base in advisory solutions. While the company’s advice solution revenues declined in the first half of 2023, the same witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2% over the last five years (2017-2022).The acquisitions of USAA’s Investment Management Company, Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, LLC and the buyout of Motif’s technology and intellectual property have further strengthened Schwab's position and helped diversify revenues.SCHW remains focused on maintaining a low-cost capital structure, which has been able to support its capital deployments. In January 2023, it announced a 14% hike in quarterly dividend, followed by one hike in July 2022, one in January 2022, one hike in 2020, one in 2019 and two in 2018. It also has a share repurchase program in place. In July 2022, the company authorized the repurchase of $15 billion worth of shares. As of Jun 30, 2023, $8.7 billion remained available under the authorization. The company is expected to continue to enhance shareholder value supported by efficient capital deployments.However, continuously mounting operating expenses are expected to hurt the company’s bottom line to an extent. Expenses witnessed a CAGR of 16.8% over the last six years (2016-2022) mainly due to a rise in compensation and benefit costs, and acquisitions. The uptrend in costs continued in the first half of 2023. An increase in costs associated with compensation and regulatory spending as well as strategic buyouts are expected to keep total expenses elevated in the upcoming quarters.Schwab’s trading revenues are expected to be under pressure for some time in the near term given the uncertain market conditions. While the company’s trading revenues witnessed a CAGR of 41.2% over the five-year period ended 2022, the same declined in 2022 and the first six months of 2023. The company has been focusing on enhancing trading revenues by undertaking several initiatives including lowering its basic online equity and ETF trade commissions to zero and reducing fees for the Schwab market cap-weighted index mutual funds.It launched Schwab Stock Slices, through which investors are able to own shares of any company in the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at $5 each, even though these shares cost more. These efforts, aimed at building client base, along with the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, are likely to lead to some improvement in trading income. However, per our estimates, SCHW’s trading revenues will be negatively impacted in the near term, as we expect a 9.6% decline in the metric in 2023.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderA couple of top-ranked stocks from the finance space are SEI Investments Company SEIC and Moody's Corporation MCO.

2,48231bf7-8e16-3660-a636-a7556abdcf35,SCHW,2023-08-18,The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) Down 8.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-corporation-schw-down-153010359.html,1692286210,STORY,['SCHW'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW). Shares have lost about 8.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is The Charles Schwab Corporation due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Schwab Q2 Earnings and Revenues Beat, Expenses RiseSchwab’s second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. The bottom line, however, declined 25% from the prior-year quarter.Results benefited from the solid performance of the asset management business. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter.However, fall in revenues due to higher funding costs, lower volatility and softer investor sentiments posed a major headwind. The company also recorded a rise in expenses.Results excluded acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangibles. After considering these, net income (GAAP basis) was $1.3 billion or 64 cents per share, down from $1.8 billion or 87 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. We had projected net income (GAAP) of $1.6 billion.Revenues Decline, Expenses RiseQuarterly net revenues were $4.66 billion, which fell 9% year over year. The decrease was mainly due to a 50% plunge in bank deposit fees, a 10% fall in NII and a 9% slide in trading revenues. These were partly offset by a 12% increase in asset management and administration fees. The top line, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.61 billion.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) increased 5% to $3 billion. We had projected this metric to be $2.6 billion. Excluding non-recurring items, expenses were $2.7 billion, up 5%.The company recorded no fee waivers in the quarter compared with $3 million in the prior-year quarter.Pre-tax profit margin decreased to 36.3% from 44.6% in the prior-year quarter.At the end of the second quarter, Schwab’s average interest-earning assets decreased 22% year over year to $485.4 billion.Annualized return on equity, as of Jun 30, 2023, was 17%, down from 19% in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesOther Business MetricsAs of Jun 30, 2023, Schwab had total client assets of $8.02 trillion (up 17% year over year). During the reported quarter, net new assets — brought by new and existing clients — were $72 billion.Schwab added 0.7 million new brokerage accounts during the quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had 34.4 million active brokerage accounts, 1.8 million banking accounts and 2.4 million corporate retirement plan participants.OutlookNIM is expected to reach the 210-bps range by the fourth quarter of 2023. Moreover, Schwab expects NIM to expand to the 270-bps range by the end of 2024, with further expansion to 3% during late 2025.The company anticipates 2023 revenues to decline 7-8% year over year.In 2023, GAAP and adjusted expense growth of 6% is expected.Management targets an incremental $500 million plus in run-rate expense savings beyond the remaining committed TDA deal synergies.If the savings are realized, the company’s 2024 year-over-year expense growth might be flat or slightly negative.The consolidated adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio is expected to reach 5% by 2023-end and be at least 6.5% before 2025.Update on TDA DealSCHW expects to complete most remaining client transitions from TD Ameritrade to Schwab across two groups over the remainder of 2023, with the transition of a small client group in the first half of 2024.The company expects to incur total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditure of $2.4-$2.5 billion.Total synergies are estimated to be $4.3 to $4.8 billion. Over the course of the integration, the company expects to realize annualized cost synergies of $1.8-$2 billion. Through Jun 30, 2023, approximately 75% of this amount was realized on an annualized run-rate basis.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, The Charles Schwab Corporation has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

7,9b35ca8c-5154-336b-8d44-26731f160012,TMO,2023-08-18,Biotech Bonanza: 3 Top DNA Stocks With Revolutionary Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biotech-bonanza-3-top-dna-173927637.html,1691775567,STORY,"['TMO', 'TWST']","[DNA is as fundamental to biotechnology as it is to biology itself. From synthetic biology to pharmaceuticals, making and using DNA is usually a necessary first step in bringing a biotech product to market. That makes the leading DNA stocks foundational to the whole biotech industry. And it means the best DNA stocks can have revolutionary potential.But of course, not all DNA is alike any more than any other product. Some companies specialize in selling DNA libraries, often made up of a single gene with point mutations at every position. That library lets you decide how best to make and express a protein of interest. Other companies give you the tools to make and extract DNA for yourself. Sell a man a fishing pole, and he’ll be your customer for a lifetime.Still, other companies sell you not just the DNA but all the ancillary products needed to use that DNA. The double helix may be the most important piece of the puzzle, but it isn’t the only piece. The leading DNA stocks have all staked out different strategies for selling their products. And it’s still up in the air as to which strategy will win.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo when looking for a high-potential DNA stock, be on the lookout for not just technology but business models too. How a top DNA stock decides to sell itself to labs and companies around the world is just as important as the cost and purity of its DNA. So for investors interested in the future of biotechnology, here are three of the must-have DNA stocks available today.Twist Bioscience (TWST)Scientific handling a light microscope examines a laboratory sample for pharmaceutical bioscience research. Concept of science, laboratory and study of diseases. Twist Biosciences (TWST)Source: dhvstockphoto / Shutterstock.comTwist Bioscience (NASDAQ:TWST) excels at selling DNA for very cheap. Since getting and testing the right DNA is step one in nearly every synthetic biology application, this gives them a very big market to work with. From DNA libraries to fragments to clone-ready genes, Twist is ready and willing to sell at rock-bottom prices. That could make them the face of the revolution in DNA stocks in the biotech sector.Story continuesBut Twist’s business practices have brought along some naysayers. In November of 2022, activist short sellers at Scorpion Capital accused Twist of selling their products for less than the cost of production. The company also claimed that Twist’s Factory of the Future in Oregon was a Potemkin village that would never materialize.Although Twist’s stock price fell precipitously on Scorpion’s claims, the company proved Scorpion wrong in one respect. The Factory of the Future has been operational since December 2022. And while naysayers may scoff, Twist’s Q3 2023 earnings report says revenue for the quarter was $64 million versus cost of revenue of $42 million — hardly selling products below cost. That same report did show a comprehensive loss of $58 million, however, so Twist still needs to show it can be profitable.Ultimately Twist’s future will rely on whether its rock-bottom prices can attract enough buyers to make up the expenses. I can say from experience that its price per base pair is lower than what any other DNA synthesis company is offering. And if the company can prove itself profitable at those prices, Twist will be the best biotech DNA stock you can buy this decade.Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is a giant in the biotechnology industry. As a company, it provides nearly everything a biology lab needs, and that includes DNA. Not only that, but Thermo Fisher also provides a number of tools for labs to alter and transform DNA to their heart’s content. Modern biology allows a quick turnaround where genes can be discovered one day, inserted into a plasmid the next and grown in a bacteria the third day. Thermo Fisher’s giant catalog of products allows scientists to do all of this from a single vendor.The business also has a network effect that many of its competitors will find hard to replicate. As the biggest supplier of many labs, managers and procurers already have a deep relationship with Thermo Fisher products and salespeople. It’s then very simple to expand that relationship to include DNA, should a lab require some. Being the biggest has its perks; you can be the first port of call for a customer who wants DNA but doesn’t know where to look.Thermo Fisher’s Q2 2023 earning report showed a slight dip in revenue year over year from $10.9 billion to $10.6 billion. That, along with increased operating costs, meant net income was down year-over-year (YoY) from $1.7 billion to $1.4 billion. TMO has been in an earnings quagmire along with much of the biotech industry. But as one of the biggest forces in that same industry, it could easily come roaring back faster than the rest. Thermo Fisher is one of the top DNA companies available, and if you believe in the future of biotechnology then you should believe in TMO.Azenta (AZTA)3d rendering of petri dish with samples for DNA sequencingSource: Connect world / Shutterstock.comAzenta (NASDAQ:AZTA)provides both DNA purchasing and sequencing, two important sides of the synthetic biology pipeline. Putting DNA into a cell isn’t always a simple and easy process, and this molecular cloning process needs to be checked at each step. Azenta, therefore, lets you buy DNA, insert it into an organism, and then send it back to the company to make sure it was inserted correctly. That helps customers control their results and lets Azenta make money at every step of the process.The business has had a busy year financially. In Q2 2023, it announced plans to repurchase a total of $1 billion in shares. That was less than its previous estimate of $1.5 billion but still a lot for a company with a market cap of under $4 billion.Then Azenta’s Q3 2023 earnings report beat expectations. Revenue grew YoY from $133 million to $166 million. And GAAP net loss fell from $9.6 million to $1.5 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.13.Azenta’s business model is a winner for synthetic biology. Its ability to offer services at every step of the pipeline is exactly what many labs want in a DNA company. And financially, the company is improving year on year, growing into a more profitable company in both GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Any biotech investor can look to Azenta as a must-have DNA stock for today.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences What Is Edwards Lifesciences's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Edwards Lifesciences had US$596.7m in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$1.51b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$912.6m net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Edwards Lifesciences' LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Edwards Lifesciences had liabilities of US$1.16b due within a year, and liabilities of US$1.40b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.51b and US$816.9m worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$231.3m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This state of affairs indicates that Edwards Lifesciences' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$47.9b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Edwards Lifesciences also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesBut the other side of the story is that Edwards Lifesciences saw its EBIT decline by 2.3% over the last year. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Edwards Lifesciences's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Edwards Lifesciences may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Edwards Lifesciences recorded free cash flow worth 62% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Edwards Lifesciences has US$912.6m in net cash. So we don't think Edwards Lifesciences's use of debt is risky. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Edwards Lifesciences insiders have bought shares recently. If you would too, then you're in luck, since today we're sharing our list of reported insider transactions for free.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip out an introduction to the well known technology billionaire, then head on over to Bill Gates Stock Portfolio Latest 2023 Update: Top 5 Stocks.Bill Gates really needs no introduction. His company, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world and one that sits at the heart of the computing revolution that has taken the planet by storm.Mr. Gates' story is one of a typical Silicon Valley entrepreneur. He attended the illustrious Harvard University for his undergraduate education, but sensing an opportunity in the computing market, dropped out and set up Microsoft in 1976. During the first decade of its existence, Microsoft would compete with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the personal computing crown and these years would signify the different approaches to a product that Gates and his rival Steve Jobs would take. While Jobs would stress the need to control the entire user experience through his product and pair the Macintosh operating system with the Mac computer, Gates would instead focus on developing software that could be used on any computer. As history shows, Gates won this war, and Microsoft is currently the world's largest computer operating system company. Apple, however, came back with the smartphone as it became the first company to capture a large market with the iPhone.After working at Microsoft for nearly four decades, Gates left the firm in 2014. However, due to his stature in the industry and his active approach towards charity, he is still a regular feature of news pieces despite nearly ten years having passed since his retirement. The Microsoft billionaire, who is worth $116 billion as of August 2023, donates to charitable causes and invests primarily through his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Apart from the foundation, he also invests through his family office called Cascade Investment. If you're interested in his family office's investments, then check out Bill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. Story continuesMr. Gates' foundation is also one of the biggest charities in the world, and estimates suggest that through it, he has donated more than $50 billion to a variety of charitable causes over the past two decades. His friendship with another well-known charitable billionaire, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, is also well known and so is Mr. Buffett's influence on Mr. Gates' investment philosophy. As opposed to Gates, who is a technology billionaire, Mr. Buffett is an old school investor who finds value in a variety of sectors such as energy and finance. These choices often hedge investment losses in a market downturn in growth stocks such as the one we witnessed last year, and Mr. Buffett has also influenced the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's investments by quite a bit. Like his friend, Mr. Gates has also pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth once he passes away.These days the billionaire is busy being a celebrity and focusing on his interests. In August, he interviewed Khan Academy's founder Sal Khan as part of his Unconfuse Me podcast where the pair discussed a variety of topics. For those out of the loop, Khan Academy is the world's premier online education platform that is made of countless free courses to make sure that children all over the world can access education for free. During the talk, Gates shared his experience around ChatGPT's early days and how OpenAI stunned him when it demonstrated its software to him. The Microsoft founder linked the demo to the time he was at Xerox PARC in the 1970s, which is a big claim if you're in the loop about computing history. If you're not, then consider the fact that the graphical user interface (GUI) developed by Xerox PARC is the precursor to the modern computing operating systems that we use today. It had a simple point and click interface, which had left both Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs stunned when they first saw it - an understandable reaction considering how the software would become the backbone of the computer.Therefore, comparing the OpenAI demo with the Xerox demo is no short claim and it underscores the impact that Mr. Gates believes that OpenAI might have on the world. During his talk with Sal Khan, Mr. Gates recalled the two demonstrations and shared:In June, they kept showing me this thing, and I was like, ""Yeah, it’s kind of an idiot savant. I don’t think it’s practical. Why don’t you see if it can do the AP Biology exam. And I’m not going to pay any attention until you can get a 5."" And I thought, ""Okay, that’ll give me three years to work on HIV and malaria."" And then it was so bizarre because Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in late August said, ""Hey, we want to come show you this thing."" It was early September when there were like thirty people at my house. And I’ve said it’s the most stunning demo I’ve ever seen in my life. I mean, right up there with seeing the Xerox PARC graphics user interface that set the agenda for Microsoft for about fifteen years. This demo was so surprising to me, the emergent depth that as they scaled up the training set, its fluency, and you have to say understanding, that computers could not read in the sense humans do, and it couldn’t write in the sense humans do. And now, with lots of footnotes about hallucination and things like that, but I’m still personally in a state of shock at wow, it is so good, and okay, therefore, let’s see where we can put it to good use.So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the August update for Bill Gates' stock portfolio. The top three Bill Gates stock picks are Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI).Bill Gates Stock Portfolio: August 2023 UpdateOur Methodology To compile our list of stocks for the August update to Bill Gates' stock portfolio, we used the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Q2 2023 SEC filings and picked top ten stocks from the portfolio.

My first thought when I saw the results was that maybe the consumer has some spending power left despite two years of rampant inflation.""The economy is so hard to predict,"" Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins told me midweek at our NYC headquarters. I agree with Chuck!Then there was the mother of all weirdness: This week's reads on US consumers apart from the barrage of upbeat government data, which I never have been a fan of.Home Depot's CEO Ted Decker opted against making a bottom call for the economy and housing market earlier in the week.Cheap chic merchandise purveyor Target issued a big-time earnings warning for the full year.When I caught up with Target CEO Brian Cornell and CFO Michael Fiddelke, they voiced greater concern about the economy than the last time we chatted about earnings three months ago.morning brief imageFiddelke specifically called out looming student loan repayments as a key factor in some very cautious third quarter guidance — even if some analysts are downplaying it.Cornell said the back-to-school shopping season had a ""solid"" start, but to me that rings hollow given the 5.4% comparable sales drop and guidance cut.A day after Target reported, Walmart blew the minds of an already bullish Wall Street. Big sales gains in stores and online. Grocery sales crushed it. Full-year guidance lifted. What a different vibe than Target's earnings!""Historically, our value proposition has been known for everyday low prices and for providing that value for customers. And what we see right now is that convenience resonates just as much to our customer base. And if you're a household that makes over $100,000 a year, you value convenience just as much as the next person,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told me.Story continuesThe read from those I talked with: This was another quarter where higher-income households traded down from Target and went to Walmart.But what's unclear is why are they trading down at all given the strength we're seeing in other categories, like fast-casual restaurants?IPO juggernaut Cava came out with an incredible earnings report this week showing same-store sales up 18.2%. People may be trading down, but they're still spending.My Cava bowl last weekend on Long Island cost $16. Sure, I got a ton of food. But I used to be able to feed myself for days for $16! So while people are cutting trips to Target and Home Depot, they apparently have a few bucks for a $16 Cava bowl with crazy feta in an urban market.In my view, the economy is weird right now, and stock prices aren’t priced for weird.

Never be left in the dust again.Cisco tops expectations; analysts mixedCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares climbed 3.3% Thursday after the tech behemoth sailed past Wall Street expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter thanks to a growing enterprise appetite for AI, security, and cloud.The company said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.14 - $0.08 better than consensus - on revenue of $15.2 billion which edged past the $15.05B average target.Earnings guidance for Q1 topped expectations at $1.02 to $1.04 per share - the Street was looking for $0.99 - and revenue of $14.5B to $14.7B was in line with targets. Full-year expectations were for earnings of $4.01 to $4.08 per share on sales of $57B to $58.2B; analysts were seeking $4.04 per share on $58.4B in revenue.CEO Chuck Robbins said on the earnings call that Cisco is poised for ""further share gains"" in campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing, having gained ""over 3 percentage points of market share"" vs. the prior year in those key areas, and believes the company is ""super well positioned"" on AI.Following these results, analysts at BofA, Citi, and KeyBanc all kept their neutral ratings on the stock.BofA and KeyBanc highlighted the company's solid execution and innovation, but BofA sees ""additional risk to estimates"" given a ""diminishing backlog contribution"" that would necessitate a ""significant order recovery throughout F24, which might not materialize."" And KeyBanc is staying neutral until it sees ""move consistent consistent signs of share gains and improved visibility into F2H24 order growth ramp.""Citi similarly said it is staying on the sidelines until it sees further market share gains in ""switch and security,"" adding that Cisco's talk of AI share gains was ""encouraging,"" but ""we await third party data verification to get more excited about share gains.""Story continuesEvercore, however, maintained its Outperform rating on Cisco and raised the target price by $3 to $63, arguing that the fiscal 2024 guidance is ""fairly conservative with room for upside"" across multiple segments. It also believes the company's commitment to ""showing operating leverage,"" and more consistent share buyback of some $1.5B quarterly, ""will resonate with investors and provide higher predictability for CSCO shareholders going forward.""Cisco shares closed Thursday at $54.73.Walmart beats, shares still slipThanks to a surfeit of budget-conscious shoppers, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said Q2 same-store sales (excluding gas) rose 6.3% from the prior year, better than the 4% estimates, and the world's largest retailer also boosted its full-year guidance.The company now sees full-year adjusted EPS at $6.36 to $6.46, well ahead of its prior range of $6.10 to $6.20. Analysts polled by InvestingPro were looking for an average of $6.28. And its top line is projected to grow by about 4% to 4.5% in all of fiscal 2024, up from the prior estimate of some 3.5%.Walmart also said Q2 earnings totaled $1.84 per share, beating the $1.69 Street expectation.Still, shares slipped 2.2% Thursday after a jump in premarket trading.CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement that Walmart's food segment had been a source of ""strength"" for the group in the 13 weeks ended on July 29. Groceries have been a key performance driver for Walmart during a recent bout of elevated inflation in the U.S., helping the business overcome a broader pullback in spending on nonessential items that has hit peers like DIY chain Home Depot and big-box firm Target.Shares ended Thursday at $155.69.Target results better than fearedMeanwhile, a day earlier, Walmart-rival Target (NYSE:TGT) saw shares rise 3% on a guidance revision that was less egregious than feared.Target's Q2 comps slid 5.4%, worse than the expected 3.8% decline. Revenue reached $24.8B, a decrease of 4.9% compared with $25.33B in the prior year.Gross margin improved to 27%, surpassing last year's 21.5% and exceeding the estimated 25.6%.Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.80, easily ahead of the expected $1.47.For Q3, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.60, well under the $1.84 consensus, while also lowering EPS estimates by $0.75 to a range of $7 to $8. Analysts were widely expecting Target to lower its guidance, and the delivered cut was seen by the market as better than feared.RBC also said the guidance ""could be conservative as mgmt looks to set a floor. All in all, barring any negative surprises on current comp trends, we think there's enough here to get shares moving in the right direction.""Citi also noted the recent negative sentiment around the stock, which explained the sigh of relief from the market regarding its guidance revision.Target shares closed Wednesday at $128.75.Home Depot tops consensusHome Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) posted Q2 comps, net sales, and EPS declines that were less steep than anticipated on Tuesday.Comparable-store sales were down 2% vs. Wall Street expectations for a 4.1% decline, and its top line was down 2% from the prior year to $42.9B, but analysts were looking for $42.1B. EPS came to $4.65, a slide from last year's $5.05 but better than the $4.46 consensus.Home Depot maintained its outlook for the fiscal year 2024, expecting comps to fall in a range of 2% to 5% and an EPS decline of 7% to 13%.CEO Ted Decker acknowledged ""continued pressure in certain big-ticket, discretionary categories"" even amid strength in categories associated with smaller home-improvement projects, adding, ""We remain very positive on the medium-to-long term outlook for home improvement and our ability to grow share in a large and fragmented market.”Shares traded up fractionally to $332.14 on Tuesday.Applied Materials trounces guidance expectationsFinally, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) delivered blowout earnings guidance after the bell Thursday after fiscal third-quarter results beat analyst estimates as the ongoing enterprise race to join the digital and AI era supported chip demand and bolstered growth.Fiscal Q4 adjusted EPS is expected at $1.82 to $2.18, smashing the consensus for $1.59, and sales of approximately $6.51B trounced the 5.87B average target.For Q3, adjusted EPS totaled $1.90, comfortably topping estimates for $1.74, and revenue of $6.43B surpassed the $6.15B average estimate.Sales in semiconductor systems, the company's largest business, fell 1.2% to $4.68B.Bernstein raised Applied Materials' price target to $175 from $150 after these results.Shares were rising 3% to $141.76 in premarket trading Friday.Yasin Ebrahim, Scott Kanowsky, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Analysts wary after Cisco's beat; retailers a mixed bagEuropean shares set for third straight weekly loss as rate jitters, China woes loom largeEuropean stocks weaken; U.K. retail sales slump]"

We continue to grow some of our newer businesses, which shape the overall model in a positive way, helping to enable us to grow profit faster than sales. We're setting the right capital priorities. And you can expect us to continue investing in the areas we've talked about, like technology, including automation, store and club remodels and with new stores and clubs in select markets. As it relates to technology, our approach to new tools like generative AI is to focus on making shopping easier and more convenient for our customers and members and helping our associates enjoy more satisfying and productive work. Ultimately, the power of generative AI or any technology is only as good as the data that powers it. Our data assets are unique. And we're excited about the potential to leverage them in new and impactful ways. We're taking large language models developed by our partners and by the broader tech community and adding retail context to create models that are uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, our associates and our supply chain. We'll unlock value for shareholders through the combination of our physical automation work with our data and increasingly intelligent software. We have a sharp focus on ROI as we drive results and set our capital priorities. The financial framework we laid out at our Investment Community Meeting in April is evident in our results from the last 2 quarters. The remodel program I mentioned includes items to support our goal of becoming a regenerative company as we put things like new refrigeration equipment and EV charging stations in place. I was in Chile last week, where I got to participate in the grand opening of a new hydrogen plant in Santiago that supports our strong business in that country. While I'm on the subject of regeneration, we recently announced a new collaboration focused on supporting U.S. and Canadian farmers to help improve soil health and water quality. Our collective goal is to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals by 2030. Some days I still get amazed by all the good work happening across our company. As a global retailer, we see how our customers and members are affected by what's happening at a macro level and how that influences their behaviors. Jobs, wages and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers. But rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs and tightening lending standards and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure. I was in Calgary visiting stores a couple of weeks ago. And our Canadian customers are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates faster than in the U.S., given their shorter-term mortgages. When you put all this together, we see families that are discerning about what they're spending on. They're setting priorities and spending on the things they care most about. We saw that during the first half of the year with Chinese New Year and Easter and more recently with July 4 and the start of back-to-school, where sales are ahead of plan so far. We see them buying more private brand items. And they're buying more grocery staples and in-home meal options consistent with eating at home. Our customers and members are resilient. They're looking for value and they trust us to be there for them. We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories. We're encouraged by how general merchandise performed during the second quarter versus our expectations. We still expect food, consumables and health and wellness primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs to grow as a percent of total in the back half. But the trends we see in general merchandise sales make us feel more optimistic about those categories in the back half of the year. Our stores and clubs give us a competitive advantage and power our omnichannel model. Our curbside pickup business continues to grow as people look for ways to save time. And store fulfill delivery is now growing faster than pickup across all three segments. Delivery speed and accuracy are obviously important. And we like how we're leveraging our physical assets. In the U.S., we have more than 4,000 stores and nearly 600 Sam's Club making same-day deliveries and nearly 2,000 stores and clubs internationally. We're increasingly measuring those deliveries in hours rather than days. In China, where we deliver from all our stores, nearly 80% of digital orders are delivered in under 1 hour. I like how we're constantly improving delivery speed. It's important to our customers and to our strategy. And I like how we're building mutually reinforcing businesses. Running great stores and scaling e-commerce are and will be our top priorities. The way we design them, along with our Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising business, is key. We'll keep prioritizing omni-retail. But we have good opportunities in health care and financial services in multiple markets. The growth of PhonePe has been fantastic. And we're building other financial products, like Cashi in Mexico and through ONE here in the U.S. We continue to build our health care services capabilities with clinic expansion. As I look at the remainder of the year, our immediate focus is on getting product costs and retails down to fight inflation, which will help with mix; improving execution of pickup and delivery orders; expense management; and inventory management by item and category. I'll wrap up by saying a big thank you to our associates. As always, they're making a difference every day for our customers and members. As we close out back-to-school and get ready for the holidays, their execution day-to-day and commitment to our customers and members is as critical as ever. Thank you for your interest in our company. Over to you, John David.John David RaineyThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong quarter with better-than-expected results in sales, operating income and adjusted EPS. Sales were strong across all segments. And we gained U.S. market share in grocery in both units and dollars while delivering gross margin rate expansion. Our focus on saving customers' time and money continues to resonate, especially in high-volume seasonal periods. We have good momentum in the business. Year-to-date, we grew sales by over 6.5%, adjusted operating income by about 12% and adjusted EPS by roughly 8%. With our Q2 results coming in better than expected, we're increasing our full year guidance. And we're well positioned as we enter the back half. I'll discuss guidance shortly. But first, I'd like to review highlights of our Q2 results using our financial framework of growth, margins and returns. Starting with growth. For the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 5.5% or more than $8 billion. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 6.4% with growth in both store and digital transactions. Grocery and health and wellness sales continued to outperform. And we're encouraged by the modest sequential improvement in general merchandise. E-commerce sales were up 24%, driven by store fulfilled pickup and delivery and advertising. We like the trends we're seeing in e-commerce. Customers are increasingly counting on us for convenience and they're visiting our app and sites more often. In Q2, weekly active digital users grew more than 20%. Similar to Q1, consumer spending remains resilient at the headline level. Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often. We see grocery staples and in-home meal options being purchased more often. Sales of general merchandise kitchen tools, like hand blenders and stand mixers, have inflected higher as customers are preparing more food at home. They're also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands. And customers still want to celebrate key moments. Over the last year here in the U.S., we partnered with suppliers to utilize rollbacks and offer select seasonal baskets of goods at the same prices as last year, essentially removing the impact of inflation. Customer response has been strong and sales have exceeded plan for events like Memorial Day, Fourth of July and our Walmart Plus Week savings event. We're taking a similar inflation-fighting approach to back-to-school with a basket of 14 of the most popular classroom essentials for under $13. In our International segment, sales were strong, up 11% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Walmex, China and Flipkart, e-commerce grew 26%. And we experienced positive store traffic across markets. Similar to the U.S., customers are still pressured by elevated inflation with spend over-indexing towards food and consumables. We're seeing higher private brand penetration across markets as customers globally look for a combination of value and quality. In Sam's Club U.S., comp sales, excluding fuel, increased more than 5% with member fee income up 7%. On margins, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points as we lapped last year's elevated levels of inventory markdowns and supply chain costs. These tailwinds were partially offset by ongoing category mix pressure as grocery and health and wellness sales outperformed general merchandise. One of our strategic priorities is improving digital margins with an eye towards e-commerce profitability. I'm pleased with the progress we're making, particularly in Walmart U.S. contribution profit, which has been driven by fulfillment efficiencies and better product margins. We're leveraging our stores to fulfill more than 50% of digital orders and activating our local delivery networks to get product to customers faster at lower cost. At our Investment Community Meeting in April, I said that we expected 200 basis points of improvement in contribution profit this year. And we're on track to achieve that goal. We're also pleased with the performance of our higher-margin growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni-retail model. I'll provide highlights on each of these. First, Marketplace. We're continuing to scale our Marketplace in the U.S. with new items and sellers. The number of customers buying items on our Marketplace increased 14% in Q2. Sales were strong in both consumables and general merchandise categories with double-digit growth across home, apparel and hardlines. And the number of sellers utilizing our fulfillment services increased more than 50%. In Mexico, we also expanded the number of sellers and items available on the Marketplace, resulting in 40% GMV growth for the quarter. In Canada, we opened our first automated e-commerce fulfillment center in Alberta, which includes Walmart Fulfillment Services and expands 2-day shipping to 97% of households. And in India, Flipkart's Myntra is the country's largest e-commerce marketplace for fashion and lifestyle products, offering top brands to customers across India. Myntra now provides access to more than 6,000 brands on its marketplace. Moving to advertising. Our global advertising business delivered strong growth of approximately 35%. In the U.S., Walmart Connect sales increased 36% in Q2. And the business has nearly doubled in size over the past 2 years. We're seeing strong growth in sponsored ads and increased demand for in-store activation. Advertiser count grew 60% with strong momentum in new advertisers. Sam's advertising business grew 33%. The in-club sales attribution feature for search and sponsored ads has generated strong interest from advertisers. On average, advertisers are seeing a nearly 30% improvement on the returns of digital ad spend as they gain full visibility to the member journey from intent to purchase, both online and in clubs. And in International, the advertising business grew nearly 40%. And lastly, membership. Sam's Club U.S. member counts increased mid-single digits with strong Plus membership growth in renewals as Plus penetration is up 1.3 percentage points versus last year. During the quarter, we achieved record member acquisition tied to Walmart Plus Week and continue to enhance the value of the Walmart+ membership. We introduced Walmart+ Assist, which provides a 50% discount off the regular membership fee for customers receiving government assistance. We also partnered with Expedia Group to launch new travel benefits for members. Turning back to the middle of the P&amp;L. As expected, SG&amp;A expenses were higher versus last year and deleveraged 33 basis points. This reflects higher variable pay expenses relative to last year, when we were below our planned performance, tech investments and increased store remodel costs in the U.S. Partially offsetting this, International expenses leveraged significantly on strong sales growth. As we increasingly utilize technology in our business, we're pleased with the performance metrics from our newly automated distribution and fulfillment nodes. Our automated e-commerce fulfillment centers are achieving efficiencies of 30% higher units per hour than nonautomated buildings. We're also seeing increased productivity from the more than 15% of stores now being served by automated regional distribution centers. It's early in the rollout process, but we're encouraged that some of these facilities are driving operating leverage well beyond our initial expectations. Second quarter adjusted operating income grew more than 8% and our adjusted EPS of $1.84 was up 4%. Our plan is to grow operating income faster than sales. And our second quarter performance achieved this despite lapping the $173 million insurance settlement that benefited International's other income last year. Similar to Q1, below the line items were pressured by higher net interest expense, reflecting the increase in rates, and noncontrolling interest due in part to stronger results from Walmex. The team continued to do a good job managing inventory. And we ended the quarter down 5%, including an 8% decline in Walmart U.S. We feel good about the progress we've made on in-stock levels as supply chain has normalized and the composition of our inventory mix has improved. We're maintaining discipline in how we're buying general merchandise during this uncertain macro environment to mitigate future risk if demand softens. ROI, or return on investment, declined 100 basis points. As a reminder, we calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis. And the decline in Q2 is a result of nearly $4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted second quarter ROI by 140 basis points. As we lap these discrete charges in the coming quarters, we expect a stronger ROI inflection in the back half of the year. We're also starting to realize some benefits from productivity initiatives that were initially planned for fiscal year '25. And we continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years. I'll now briefly discuss some additional Q2 highlights for each segment. For Walmart U.S., our 6.4% sales comp included a high single-digit increase in grocery and a high-teens increase in health and wellness. Although general merchandise sales declined low single digits versus last year, these results were 300 basis points better than Q1, aided by outperformance from early back-to-school shopping in our Walmart+ savings event. We saw a 240 basis point shift in sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness in Q2. Grocery inflation moderated more than 400 basis points from Q1 levels and more than 700 basis points year-over-year to a high single-digit increase as we lapped higher levels from last year. On a 2-year stack, grocery inflation remained over 20%. We're encouraged by the growth in units sold, particularly in food categories where disinflation is more pronounced, such as fresh meats, seafood and eggs. In addition, private brand sales in grocery were up more than 9% with penetration up nearly 40 basis points in Q2 and up more than 170 basis points on a 2-year stack. Lower markdowns and supply chain costs resulted in a gross margin rate increase of 40 basis points despite ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. The negative impact to margin mix from outsized growth in branded drugs accelerated in Q2. Other income grew nearly 4%, led by continued growth in Walmart+ memberships. And overall, Walmart U.S. operating income increased 7.6%. Our International segment delivered another impressive quarter with double-digit sales growth and strong underlying profit growth. Operating income increased 2.2% but was negatively impacted by 20 percentage points from lapping last year's insurance recovery that I mentioned earlier. Walmex had another strong quarter with sales up 10%, reflecting strength in our Bodega stores, Sam's Club and e-commerce. E-commerce sales grew in the low 20s with traffic up more than 5%. Walmex is an excellent example of our omnichannel retail strength across formats and channels. Bodega Aurrera is celebrating its 65th anniversary and has become the most valuable retail brand in Mexico. These Bodega stores have consistently delivered strong performance and continue to accelerate e-commerce to better serve customers, now offering more than 60,000 SKUs from 586 stores in 299 cities. In China, sales increased 22%, led by strength from Sam's Club and e-commerce. We're executing well with increased online and offline traffic across both the Sam's and hypermarket formats. In India, Flipkart delivered strong GMV and net sales growth as the core business continues to perform well. The team continues to focus on expanding the ecosystem of products and services like advertising, travel and health care and on delivering continued contribution profit improvement. Flipkart's consistent progress and performance reinforces our confidence in the long-term value of this business. India is leading the largest digital transformation in the world. And Flipkart is the leading marketplace in India. And we continue to be super impressed with PhonePe's strong and consistent performance. Annualized TPV, or total payment volume, has surpassed $1.15 trillion. And for the first time, we processed more than 5 billion transactions in a single month. Sam's Club delivered another strong quarter with solid unit growth in e-commerce, up 18%. It's encouraging to see members embrace omnichannel with strong in-club traffic gains and increasing engagement with our digital tools in and outside the club. In Q2, utilization of Scan &amp; Go increased 570 basis points and curbside pickup saw double-digit growth. Similar to Walmart, sales strength at Sam's was led by grocery and health care categories as the members focused on value and essentials. While discretionary categories were pressured overall, items with compelling price and quality and strong value to market are driving sales. Sam's Club operating income was up 22% due in part to lower LIFO charges. Turning to guidance. There continues to be a reasonable level of uncertainty in the economic backdrop for the balance of this year. While inflation has moderated and employment levels have been steady, credit markets have tightened, energy prices are higher and some customers face additional expense from the resumption of student loan payments in October. As such, we continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook. We're raising our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3. I'll highlight the key changes, but please refer to the press release for a full list of updated metrics. For the full year, we now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 4% to 4.5%. We now anticipate LIFO will be a $200 million charge to operating income versus the $500 million charge that was in our prior guide. We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 7% to 7.5%. This now assumes a 30 basis point year-over-year tailwind from LIFO compared to our prior guidance, which assumed a 100 basis point headwind. And we estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.36 to $6.46, including an expected $0.05 impact from LIFO. To bridge to our prior guide, we flowed through the Q2 beat, removed the Walmart U.S. LIFO charges that were previously expected in Q3 and Q4 and modestly raised our sales expectations. Looking at Q3, we're now offering the following view. We expect net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 3%. Operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 1%. This year-over-year growth is impacted by several comparison factors. We expect ongoing mix pressure impacts to gross margin to continue in Q3. We also expect a negative impact from fuel margins at Sam's Club versus last year's elevated levels. And similar to Q2, variable pay expense is expected to be higher in Q3 versus last year, when we were below our planned performance. We don't typically guide currency, but it's worth noting that if rates stayed where they are currently, we'd see a $1.6 billion benefit to Q3 reported sales and reported operating income growth would be closer to 3.5%. And lastly, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.45 to $1.50. In closing, we're pleased with the strong first half of the year. And we've positioned the business favorably for the back half. Our financial performance is validating our omnichannel strategy, driving organic sales growth while improving margins and returns. We're optimistic about our ability to improve our performance even more in the future. We like our position. And now I'll hand it back to Doug for a few comments before the operator opens the line for questions.C. Douglas McMillonThank you, John David. Before we take your questions, I want to say a few words about the leadership changes we shared yesterday. Let's start by celebrating Judith. She has done a fantastic job in many roles over the 27 years she's been part of our company. She leaves her most recent role having delivered strong results and having transformed the business. It's a different portfolio, better positioned for the future, it's better positioned for growth on the top and bottom line. She strengthened our culture and sets us up for a digital future at the same time. We're grateful. Let's talk about Kath moving into the International leadership role. The results Kath and our team have delivered at Sam's speak for themselves. Her experience and passion to serve customers and members will take us to the next level. It will be fun to watch her impact around the world. Some of you met Chris Nicholas and know how capable he is. He joined us 5 years ago in a finance role but with previous experience in merchandising and operations in several markets around the world. He'll keep our member obsession going in Sam's Club U.S. and pick right off where Kath left off. We also shared yesterday that Kieran Shanahan will join John's team and become our Walmart U.S. Chief Operating Officer. Kieran has 25 years with our company working in a wide variety of roles in all three segments. He is well prepared to lead this big team and the change that's coming through our automation investments in the supply chain. As they build these new roles, John, Kath, Chris and Kieran will have all four worked in all three operating segments of our business. There's not only a lot of store and club expertise in this group, but there's also a great deal of digital and e-commerce experience. These are omnichannel merchants that are purpose-driven, proven leadership skills. The depth of leadership in our company is such an advantage. But times get passed and we keep running, keep changing and keep pushing things forward. I want to say congratulations to all of them. And now I'll turn it back over to the operator. And we're happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.Robert Frederick OhmesDoug, you mentioned that you're seeing things in general merchandise, I think, that make you more optimistic about the back half. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing? I think John David said something about disciplined buying in general merchandise. What are you seeing that's making you optimistic? And how should we think about general merchandise? And maybe if you could also weave in there, I know that you guys have continued to mention the high-income customer shopping. I think it's been more grocery-focused. Have you seen high-income customers broadening out into the rest of the store?C. Douglas McMillonRobby, this is Doug. I'll go first and then John or others can add if they want to. What's making me feel a little bit better is the run rate compared to the previous quarter and how back-to-school started. And typically, when back-to-school is strong, it bodes well for what happens with Halloween and Christmas in GM in the back half. I do think our food and consumables as a percent of total in Walmart U.S. will still go up. Part of it is what's happened with inflation and disinflation in the GM categories. But relative to what I would have thought 90 days ago, or when we started the year, GM is holding up better than I would have guessed. And I just -- I feel like that with our store managers and the merchants, we want to have an optimistic posture on GM as we go into the back half. Anybody want to add anything?John R. FurnerYes, Doug, I'd like to give credit to the team for improvements they made. If you think about where we were last year with inventory headwinds this year, I was in stores this week, and it's really clear that stores have the ability and are merchandising their store with discretion appropriately. They're on top of their markdowns. Back rooms are in much better shape. The second thing I think that's helping is the e-commerce team has done a nice job launching new products, things like registry for teachers and classrooms and parents and list. Those are all working and helping back-to-school. And then the last thing that I'd say is the team is doing a really nice job with seasonal events and holidays. One of the things that we hear consistently from customers right now as they're looking forward to celebrating again like they used to. That's a bit of a theme that's coming through. And we certainly saw that from Memorial Day, July 4, back-to-school started strong. So we're looking forward to holiday. It's going to be a big holiday season. There are a lot of dynamics, as John David and Doug said, in the market. But we want to remain very flexible and prepared to help people get together and celebrate each of these holidays that are in front of us.John David RaineyThere are also categories of general merchandise that on our Marketplace saw double-digit increases, things like home, apparel, hardlines, which really gives you an indication of how our business is changing as we're selling more third-party assortment.John R. FurnerIt is. And John David, I think our event, our Plus event you mentioned in your remarks as well, is a good example. We had a high level of participation from Marketplace sellers. We've talked about the number of items available in the sites, up almost 4x from a year ago. Our seller count has grown. The number of customers are growing. And Tom and the team have done a nice job building capabilities that will really help us in the future.John David RaineyOn the second part of your question, Robby, with respect to high-income consumers, we continue to see share gains across all income demographics. I think encouragingly for us in the quarter, the number of categories that we saw share gain in actually expanded. But this has been pretty consistent for 5 or 6 quarters now. And it really points to the fact that our value proposition is resonating with customers. It's not just about everyday low prices, it's also about convenience. And convenience matters to every household income demographic.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneWith gross margin expanding about 50 basis points in the quarter, is there a way to quantify the buckets of contribution between the higher-margin businesses, like Marketplace and advertising, and the impact mix that's coming from the stronger grocery? And just given the more optimistic general merchandise commentary, is there any update to your mix assumptions in guidance for the second half when it comes to gross margins?John David RaineyThe biggest contributors to the gross margin expansion were really just the lapping of some of the markdowns that we had last year. I would point you to that as the single biggest contributor. But that's not to take away from some of the progress that we're seeing in terms of diversifying or expanding these other higher-margin initiatives. And advertising is one I mentioned in my prepared remarks, up 35% for the quarter. But equally as impressive or perhaps more impressive is the advertiser count was actually up 60% year-over-year in the quarter. And it stands to reason, if we're gaining share and customers are shopping with us, then advertisers are going to want to spend their money where the eyeballs are. So we're encouraged about this. And it really illustrates the sort of this flywheel element of our business. As we get stronger in Marketplace and some of these other initiatives, it enables us to go out and be better in advertising and other things that tend to have a higher margin.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Oliver ChenJudith, congrats as well. The guidance could be conservative based on the great quarter you just had. How are you thinking about what's incorporated in ticket and traffic for next quarter? And also, as we look forward to holiday, what are some highlights of how you're planning inventory price points assortment? In fact, we often correlate it to holiday. So that's very encouraging that you're seeing good performance there. And just a follow-up, you've done a great job with computer vision and neural networks, especially with inventory management. You called out generative AI and LLM. What are your thoughts about how that may intersect the Walmart+ and all the data you have on being tech-enabled in terms of context and customer interaction?C. Douglas McMillonI'll take the last one first. This is Doug, Oliver. Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about what's possible. And we've been working for a few years now to try and get our data in better shape so that we can really put it to work. We've still got room to improve there, but we have made progress. And when you start imagining what we can do to personalize for customers and members more effectively while still living in an EDLP world and driving the business model that way because that's the winning strategy for us, there's a great opportunity for us to be more anticipatory and to be more relevant to them and communicate in a way that shows that we know who they are in a healthy way while protecting privacy. So having that data go to work with our own large language models and using large language models from others presents a tremendous opportunity. And I think it will unlock a lot of use cases on the customer and member side. As I mentioned in the prerecorded remarks, the opportunity with associates is also terrific. The supply chain is the third area that comes to mind. So I think this will be an opportunity for us for a really long time to try and grow top line and be more efficient as a company by putting that technology to work.John David RaineyI'll take the first part of your question on guidance and maybe start on holiday before I turn it to the segment CEOs. But on our assumptions on ticket and traffic, well, we saw a pretty equal balance between those in the second quarter. Both were up, call it, roughly 3%. It would stand to reason that as we get into the back half of the year and we lap some of these -- some of the higher inflation from last year that ticket and in terms of the balance between those two, we may see a little less in ticket. But we're really encouraged by, as we noted, the strength in units that we had in the quarter, so pleased about that. And again, we're gaining share here. So I think our value proposition is resonating. With respect to the holiday, I'll just say one comment and maybe turn it to John. Consumers are not compromising on some of the holiday seasons, so being choiceful in their spending, discerning. But around July 4 and some of the other holidays that we've seen, they're showing a willingness to spend. And we're -- our team is leaning into that, providing merchandise that they want to buy.John R. FurnerThey are, John David. And we've talked about this for a while that the flexibility in terms of what we offer is meaningful for customers. And the transaction growth, we're proud of the team. We saw that in e-commerce. We mentioned Marketplace. Pickup and delivery have been strong. In-store traffic and transaction count has also been strong. So having an offering that's there for the customer, however they want to shop, whenever they want to shop, is helping us. And having as many locations as we do certainly is an important part of the equation when it comes to delivering. The last thing I would say is in general merchandise and other categories, where we have seen a number of rollbacks this year that are quite intentional. The results are really strong, whether it's the Justice 17-inch backpack or the Frito-Lay multi-pack, from general merchandise to food, we are seeing rollbacks work across the business and customers are responding. They're choiceful. They're being thoughtful about what they buy. And our merchants have done a nice job of leaning in seasonally to ensure that our rollbacks are in the right places for the customer.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhSo I wanted to go to the International business and China specifically. I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you're seeing in the market. Now for the second consecutive quarter in a row, your results seem to stand out versus some of the weaker macro data points that we're seeing out there in China.Judith McKennaYes, thank you. I mean, the quarter was strong for International overall. And as you heard both John David and Doug mentioned, China was one of the stronger markets that we had along with Walmex, which had a 10% growth. And both of our businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe, both had strong quarters as well. A lot of that is driven from just really being close to the customer in those markets and the combination of value and convenience that we're now able to offer. Turning to China specifically. I actually got back to China this quarter for the first time in 3.5 years. And what really struck me when I was there was the speed with which the consumer has moved. So the move to online and digital penetration has been extraordinary in our business. It ranges in the mid-40% that we're seeing. And we have two formats there. We have the Sam's Club format and we have the hypermarket format. And what's interesting is both formats have got positive traffic and both are gaining market share. And I think the reason for that is this back to this combination of value and quality and trust that we're able to provide. Sam's Club, in particular, had a really strong quarter again. And we opened a couple of new clubs. We now have 45 clubs across China, and they're really combining great items at great value. And they're seeing an interesting trend in higher penetration of very high ticket items in China, too. In the hypers, I got a chance to visit some of our remodeled, new version hypermarkets. You've heard me talk a couple of times about the transformation in hypers, that's ongoing. And I was really impressed with the thoughtful way in which the teams there have reduced assortment, brightened and freshened the stores, increased the signage, helped customers navigate not only through great fresh departments but also made the general merchandise shopping much simpler. So they have two formats there, both of which are leading in the segments in which they operate. And that's helping us win customers. And our associates, I will just say, there are doing a fantastic job. And it was just great to see them after such a long time.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious within food and grocery how you would characterize the current landscape from a promotional perspective relative to last year and history. And how are you thinking about price investment as a tool to gain further market share, just given the changes in inflation expectations?John R. FurnerCompared to a year ago, Paul, certainly inflation is at a lower rate than what it was. It's been relatively stubborn in dry grocery more than other places over the course of the year. Price gaps are something that we spend a lot of time on each and every week. We start Monday talking about trading and what's happening in the market. Price is always one of the major topics. We want to ensure that our value is done right. And we are pleased with where the value is today. The grocery business is gaining share. Certainly, we're going to watch the market. As I said a moment ago, we do have a number of rollbacks that are effective in food. Our rollback count in food is higher than last year. It is lower in general merchandise than a year ago. But a reminder that last year, we were clearing a lot of inventory that had been backlogged. So the general merchandise rollbacks, which are very effective, are more choiceful and I think reflective of the seasons that people are in. So our job from here is to ensure that we're ready for people that are getting back to school all across the country in the next couple of weeks, colleges. We have tailgating season coming up, Labor Day and then right into the holiday food season.Kathryn J. McLayI'd say, too, I felt promotions is the easy solution to inflation versus doing the hard work of working with your suppliers to walk back all the commodity and cost increases that kind of have been absorbed over the last 2 years. So there's a lot of work in just tracking the cost of transportation. And then as that's come down, working back with each supplier to have a look at what proportion of the cost is impacted by that and how do you roll that back. So I know in Sam's, the team have a great big board. They ring a cowbell every time we get a cost decrease. And you flow it on to the member. And I think that's how we want to think about it versus thinking about how do we go out and do promotions.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanJudith, congratulations, and to every promotion, congratulations. My question is more medium term. I wanted to ask about the inflection on EBIT dollar growth. At Shareholders', we talked about how in fiscal '25, it should or could get better than where we are today, realizing we're lapping some easy compares from last year right now. Can we hone in on what needs to take place for this EBIT dollar growth inflection? Assuming healthy sales, leverage over fixed cost, Marketplace ramping, is it advertising? Can you talk about sort of what's in your control and what's more sales-driven as we think about EBIT growth going forward?John David RaineySure, Simeon. I'll start with maybe a bit of a victory lap here. Because the first half of the year has actually been pretty good in terms of the relationship of operating income and sales. We've grown the top line at, call it, 6% and operating income at almost twice that. And that's much better than what we've done historically. So we're very encouraged internally that we're executing so well right out of the gate after sharing our goals at our Investor Community Meeting in April. As we get into next year, really what you're going to see is more of a continuation of the strategy that we laid out is we further diversified our earnings streams. A lot of these areas, like advertising and data ventures, these higher-margin businesses are growing at a rate much, much faster than the rest of our business. And so as you look at the math around that, our margins just want to go up. The other thing is, as you're well aware of, Simeon, are the efficiencies that come from our supply chain. And so today, we have roughly 15% of our stores that are served by automated regional distribution centers. And when you think about something like an e-commerce FC, that gives us efficiencies of upwards of 30% on things like units per hour. And so as we continue to roll out this automation to the rest of our network, we're going to see the benefits of that in our P&amp;L. You're seeing it right now. And it gives us conviction and optimism as we look out over the next several years to be able to grow operating income at a rate that is faster than sales and perhaps appreciably faster than sales.C. Douglas McMillonSimeon, this is Doug. I'll just add on. I think John David said it well, the two threads, the two questions are how is the automation work going? And how is that playing through as it relates to productivity? And that's a multiyear implementation of these various forms of automated storage and retrieval systems that we've talked to you about. And then the second one is how is the business model changing? And the engine for that is what's the digital percent of total, how is e-commerce growing and what's the pull-through to advertising and the other components that shape that business model. And the reason I'm repeating it is because I wanted to make the point that it's not just the Walmart U.S. business that's going through that transformation. As I've been traveling in International in the last few weeks, the commonality from Canada to Chile, and Judith had that team from Mexico in town this week, what Gui and the team are doing there, it's very consistent as it relates to how omnichannel retail is coming to life across our company. So I think those are the two threads to keep your eye on.John David RaineyYou didn't frame the question, Simeon, in terms of return on investment. But I want to take an opportunity to talk about that. When we get to the end of this year and you look at our ROI on a trailing 12-month basis, we're going to see fairly material uptick if you look at our guidance, what's implied there. And that's more than what we expected at the beginning of the year. We actually anticipated that some of the improvements in ROI would be -- would come next year and some of the years thereafter. We are actually pulling forward some of those benefits that we expected next year. And so we're going to see some of that this year.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.Kelly Ann BaniaCongrats on your retirement as well, Judith. Wanted to just ask about e-commerce growth, 24%, I think, implies some pretty big market share gains but led by pickup and delivery. And I was curious if you could also just give us a sense of how Marketplace and 3P is ramping relative to your expectations and how, if at all, that's impacting the general merchandise comp. And related to that, I guess, as you think of long term about the profitability of advertising, is there a similar opportunity on the food and consumables side? Or is it better to have discretionary and 3P a greater mix of e-commerce as it relates to growing advertising profitability?C. Douglas McMillonKelly, thanks for the question. One, really happy with the performance. And the team deserves credit for a lot of improvements that enabled the 24% growth. When we talk about pickup and delivery specifically, I think I would take a step back and just remind everyone what we talked about at our investor conference and what we're ultimately trying to do with supply chain in the entire e-commerce business, is densify our inventory at the first mile, make the middle mile as efficient as possible and then shorten the last mile. And our store locations, over 4,700 locations in addition to the fulfillment centers, enable us to do that. So what's happened over the last year or so is more of our e-commerce business and deliveries have come from stores because that's where the inventory is closest to the customer and helps us with efficiency. So it's important to frame that, that is a part of the total. The way we measure this internally as we look at the number of transactions and customers and what they bought in the store, what they picked up and what was delivered. The second part of your question, really pleased with the progress in Marketplace. Our Plus event was a good marker for us in terms of what's possible. With the Marketplace, a majority of our revenue from that event was driven by Marketplace sellers. And I'm thankful to the sellers who participated and helped us find customers or helped our customers find value at a time when they're looking for value. And that was across all categories, including general merchandise. In fact, much of the event was general merchandise. So I think the team has positioned the Marketplace well. And in terms of the second part of your question with advertising, there are opportunities for sellers. There are opportunities for suppliers. We'll continue to learn, grow and experiment in stores and on the site. We want to ensure that Walmart Connect, the name Walmart Connect, connects our buyers, suppliers and sellers all to our customers in a way that's accretive to the customer experience. We want to make sure that customers are finding what they want when they want it. And if this business can help people connect together, that's great. And we saw that happen in the quarter. And the growth was higher than our e-commerce growth.Judith McKennaIf we're talking about e-commerce and Marketplace, it would be particularly be remiss of me not to talk about Flipkart and the growth that we've seen there. We were there as well recently. And that business is just continuing to go from strength-to-strength. It's consistently performed in line with our expectations over the last few years. I'm really pleased to see the positive contribution margins continue. And then their business mix is really quite healthy, so seeing strength in hardlines, particularly across mobile and electronics as well. The scaling of their ecosystem is also helping contribute not only to the overall business but also to their advertising revenues well. So interesting, coming back to this theme of quality and convenience of people, they recently launched in their Cleartrip business, luxury packages of holidays in India, which are going incredibly well as well. Myntra, which is the largest fashion online retailer in India, as John David mentioned as well, they've just launched a MyFashionGPT capability as well, which is quite incredible. And I used it this morning. I put in, ""What to wear to go to the airport."" And they gave me, ""To England, to the airport."" And they gave me, ""Black T-shirt, black leggings, a jacket and sunglasses,"" which I think was rather optimistic using the sunglasses for England. But it shows you the power of what I think gen AIs can do in the future. And it's really coming to life in India. It's just a great business, and be proud to be able to be associated with it for the last 5 years.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler.Edward James YrumaYou guys have done a lot to enhance the accessibility at Walmart+. You've added a ton of new features. I guess, as you sit back and assess the success of the program, kind of what's turned the dial the most? And then in terms of the data you're able to now collect, where have you been able to kind of pivot and change the flow of business based on some of the stuff that you're collecting from these Walmart+ customers?C. Douglas McMillonEdward, certainly, we want to have a digital relationship with as many customers as possible, pleased with the growth overall. And as we've talked about before, Plus is an important part of the offer we have. I would pull the reason back that Plus has had more success to the very core of the offer. The offer was established to limit the number of deliveries people get without having a charge on those deliveries from both the fulfillment centers and the stores. We launched this in 2020, certainly had issues at that point with availability. And we've had inventory imbalances. But in the last year or so, the focus continues to be and improvements have been in the core, where we measure every week something we call perfect order. The stores are very focused on what we call the first-time pick rate, which is picking the order the first time they look for it. And then another thing that we do very intentionally is measure what percent of the order was delivered before there were any substitution. So what customers are looking for is exactly what they ordered at the time that they expected it to be delivered. And that's the way we hold ourselves accountable. Certainly, the other benefits are helpful. There are different features that people are using. And it is important to have a variety of benefits. But the core of the offer is the most important thing that we have to execute going forward.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.Seth Ian SigmanI wanted to follow up on the value proposition that Walmart offers today. So private label seems to have a lot of momentum and is likely one of the factors that's helping drive market share here. How are you managing private label differently than in the past? And how do you think that plays into the competitive gap here more from a basket-level perspective? And then ultimately, do you think that this advantage is sustainable even in an environment where maybe inflation moderates or prices decline? Love some perspective on that.C. Douglas McMillonIt's important for us to have a wide range of assortment for a broad section of customers, where all over the country, situations are different for different customers. And whatever the situation is for any particular customer, then that's what we want to be there for. We've talked about this before. We don't set targets or percentages of the business that we expect private label to grow to or be a part of. It's important that we have values on brands, on branded items. It's important that we have values and quality across the portfolio in e-commerce and stores. And in the last few quarters, customers have chosen the private brands at Walmart at an accelerated pace. I think there are a lot of reasons for that. But if our quality and price were in the position that it needs to be, then they wouldn't repeat. So we'll continue to stay focused on quality and value there.Kathryn J. McLayYes. And I think from a Member's Mark perspective, we have seen our metrics around value for money and NPS and quality, our Member's Mark has continued to improve. And we're seeing members choose it because of the quality of the item, because of innovation into those products and also because the great value that they get out of the Member's Mark, price/quality combination.C. Douglas McMillonWe're seeing leverage across markets with private brands, too, whether it's Great Value or Member's Mark.Judith McKennaYes, Member's Market, of course, is available in our Sam's Clubs globally, around the world but also many other items as well. And I know you were in Chile recently, Doug. And they have a phenomenal international foods aisle, which is showing incredible growth, many of which are private brands, which are imported from around the world, from the rest of the Walmart world.C. Douglas McMillonWhen I was in Canada, they made me Great Value tomato ketchup potato chips. I'm out on that. But that's not -- I'm sure Canadians love it, but that's one private brand item that I'm not a fan of.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.Corey TarloweI was wondering if we could just take a step back and assess the health of the overall customer maybe in the U.S. and also perhaps internationally versus the first quarter and into the second quarter and how you're thinking about the general health of the customer throughout the remainder of this year. And then just secondarily, on shrink, what are you seeing as it relates to shrink? And what are you expecting ahead as we think about that particular dynamic?C. Douglas McMillonFrom an enterprise point of view, just on the customer and member first, and others can chime in on that, I feel like that our position is one where if things do get tougher, they're going to increasingly look for value and we're going to be able to grow the top line. Hopefully, things do get better. And there are a lot of conflicting data points, but you guys see the same data that we do. There are reasons to be optimistic in areas like employment and the wage inflation that's happened. And there are other reasons to be concerned as consumer balance sheets potentially weaken over time. But again, we like our position. We like it in terms of the breadth of product categories, we can sell whatever people want to buy. We like it in terms of the way we can serve people, whether it's curbside or it's delivery or it's in a store or club. So our job is to grow our share, to win through the customer value prop, which is price, assortment, experience and trust. And whether that's in Mexico or the United States, that's the position that we put ourselves in. And we just need to execute against that. On shrink, John, you can comment, too, but I'd just remind everybody from a total enterprise point of view, we're more than a domestic retailer. And we've got 19 countries. We've got Sam's Club. We've got a variety of businesses. And so it's not necessarily the same answer as maybe some of the others that are in the news about shrink.John R. FurnerAnd Doug, I'd add that, of course, shrink is an important part of margin. But there are many parts of margin that are important to be able to deliver for customers. And the first is we want to make sure that we're pricing as low as possible, so customers find the greatest value that they can possibly find. Shrink has increased a bit this year. It increased last year. It's uneven across the country. It's not in every market. Some markets are higher than others. But we do have the tailwinds that we mentioned earlier, which are cost of supply chain and markdowns from last year. So a lot of components go into this. We'll keep watching it. We don't want it to go up obviously because it could cause prices to rise. And we've heard that across the market. But it is a part of what we're managing. And the team is doing a nice job with value. And the team is doing a nice job managing the margin in total.C. Douglas McMillonShrink is comprised of more than one thing. That's part of it. And we do think that in some jurisdictions here in the U.S., there needs to be action taken to help protect people from crime, including theft. The other part of shrink is more controllable. And we stay focused on that as a priority.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank.Krisztina KataiI'll add my congratulations to Judith as well. I have a question on Sam's Club. I think I heard you say mid-single-digit member growth within the quarter. So can you talk about your membership gains and the momentum that you have been seeing in the business as well as the renewal rate and how you think about membership value for the consumer in the face of moderating food inflation? And then secondly, if I could just ask on the private label penetration that is still increasing, just how are you generally anticipating volumes to play out in the back half of the year between your private brands versus your national brands as rollbacks are increasing?Kathryn J. McLayIf I start with just talking about the member health, we've seen historic growth in our membership base over the last few years. And we continue to see growth in absolute member numbers. Our tenured renewal rate held, so it didn't increase or decrease, it held from quarter-to-quarter. And we are continuing to look at different ways to introduce people to the value of a Sam's Club membership. And so you've seen us over the years try a couple of different things. On our 40th birthday, we had a great price for new members. Really, that's just an opportunity to invite people in to experience for themselves what the value of membership looks like. And then we want to turn them into a tenured renewal member going forward. So we feel strong about the health of our membership and the growth that we've seen.John R. FurnerAt Walmart, on our membership, consistent growth last few quarters, but we really did have the successful Plus event, really good results all across the business. As I said earlier, the core of the offer is the most important thing that we deliver. And that includes perfect order or fill rates and availability. Customers trust us to be able to deliver their food, consumables and general merchandise items consistently and on time. On the question on private brand volume, I would also just repeat consistency over the last couple of quarters. And we've talked about growth of private brands really since the beginning of 2022. Again, we don't have targets on that. We want to be there for customers regardless of what they choose. Whether it's a branded item or private brand item on private brands, we stay focused on quality and value. And in some cases, like if you're in a store today, you would see a rollback on Great Value mustard, and it's working really well. It's a staple that has seen really great growth because of values that we offer. So getting prices back down in dry grocery is important for the consumer. And we want to be able to help them and lead that in any way that we can.John David RaineyIf I can just say one other thing on private brand, we discussed that because I think it gives a good indication on how the consumer is being pressured right now. But that is not a driver of our margin performance. While the overall margin on private brand may be a little bit higher, the dollar profit is about the same. And if you look at the shift in composition year-over-year, we're only talking 40 basis points. So this is not a driver of our financial results. So if we see a reversion there, it's not going to have any outsized impact on our business.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserDoug, is it fair to think that Walmart has more visibility into its gross margin rate heading into next year than it has in recent memory, given the inflection in the profitability of the e-commerce business, the contribution from alternative profits, presumably less of a drag from GLP-1 drugs and the prospect that general merchandise gets better? And if that is fair, do you take this as an opportunity to double down and accelerate some of the investments that clearly have been working and translating into share gain?C. Douglas McMillonMichael, thanks for the question. We didn't see COVID coming. And we didn't anticipate inflation to be as high as it has been in the United States. So if you could tell me what we're not anticipating right now, I might be able to answer your question about next year. I think your underlying premise that we kind of know what the shape is and we're not in this position that we were 12 months ago with inventory has got some truth to it. As it relates to doubling down, I think we are being aggressive. We are currently going through our long-range planning cycle. And as we look at our opportunities to invest next year and over the next 5 years, we look at that board and we get excited about it. John David made the point in a meeting earlier this week that isn't it cool to be a part of a company that started in 1962 that sees opportunities to drive strong returns with today's investments to help you contemporize the business for the future? And I agree with that. Like it's a really cool spot to be in, to have cash flow, to have this strong business and to have opportunities in front of us that transform the business and create another level of operational excellence through productivity, for example. So I think we've got an aggressive plan. We talked at the investor conference about our capital plan. And we continue to see opportunities to invest to grow top and bottom line. And we expect ROI to go up over time. It may not happen that every quarter, operating income grows faster than sales. But over time, as we said at the investor conference, we expect that to be the case because of productivity in the business model's shape. So I just repeat what we said there. I think we're being appropriately aggressive, given the environment. And I'm excited about that.John David RaineyYes. I would just add, Michael, just like you view a portfolio of stocks, you diversify because it reduces the risk. I think in some ways, we're doing the same thing with our business. We're not solely dependent upon just what's happening with brick-and-mortar retail. Like we've got other income streams that, by definition, sort of the diversification of that reduces our dependency on any one thing and also reduces the risk around that, too. So we feel pretty good about our outlook.C. Douglas McMillonJust maybe one more comment on strategy. As we go through this year's cycle, and I think this was true to a large degree last year, I mean, it's pretty common. But we know what the components are. And it's a challenge to execute it across multiple fronts. I mean, it's full-time work to run great stores and clubs. It's also full-time work to grow an excellent e-commerce business. And there are lots of components to that. And it's got to happen around the world. But we've got the resources. And importantly, we've got the talent to do it. And so I think the shape of that board, kind of the where-to-play aspect of our strategy, looks pretty consistent and that builds confidence. We just -- we're in execution mode and we like the plan that's right in front of us.OperatorWe've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.C. Douglas McMillonBefore I wrap things up, I just want to acknowledge the tragedy that happened in Hawaii and in Maui. The company has stepped forward with financial support for United Way and Red Cross. As you would expect, we're providing essentials and providing supplies. We're flying merchandise there. We're bulking up on what people need. And our team on the ground has done a fantastic job. Our store manager there is Chris Pierce. And Chris and his team have supported the community there, as you would expect them to, and we're really proud of them. That was a terrible tragedy. As we wrap up, I'll thank you for your focus on our business. As I mentioned just a second ago, we are really excited about what's in front of us. I think you know what the plan is. We're positioned to grow the top line. Over time, we can grow profit faster than sales through productivity and shaping the business model differently, which will result in higher levels of return on investment. And we're excited about delivering that. And I'm grateful to what everyone did for this quarter. And I want to thank Judith for what she's contributed to this company. It's been really significant. And we're going to miss her, thankful she's sticking around for a little while to help with some things. And I'm excited for Kath and Chris and Kieran. Walmart has got a deep bench, and we'll keep going. Thank you all for your time.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"
20,5a53287b-a7e9-3a38-8f2f-4bcfa507532e,JWN,2023-08-18,Analysts Estimate Nordstrom (JWN) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-nordstrom-jwn-report-140013808.html,1692280813,STORY,"['JWN', 'FL']","[The market expects Nordstrom (JWN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -44.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.65 billion, down 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.71% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom?For Nordstrom, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nordstrom will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nordstrom would post a loss of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.07, delivering a surprise of +158.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nordstrom doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, Foot Locker (FL) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share for the quarter ended July 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -96.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.87 billion, down 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Foot Locker has been revised 3.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 11.42%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Foot Locker will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this fund, MIM aims to develop and acquire single-family and purpose-built rental houses across 75 biggest U.S. markets. This move should aid MetLife in tapping the growing demand for single-rental houses amid high-interest rates. However, shares of MetLife lost 0.3% on Aug 16, replicating a broader decline in markets.This move bodes well for MetLife’s investment management arm, which had $587.5 billion in assets under management as of Jun 30, 2023. This new venture is an extension of MIM’s experience in making investments in the housing segments, wherein it has served clients well. The company aims to provide renters with well-located units for their use. MIM’s single-family rental fund is the first of its kind closed by the real estate equity team. It has secured capital from a group of global institutional investors.Rising interest rates have made single-family housing unaffordable for home buyers, shifting them to rental houses. Due to the rising demand for rental houses, rents should grow, benefiting the fund. The demand for the rental housing market remains strong as millennials seek inexpensive alternatives to apartment rentals and homeownership.Moreover, the company aims to create value by developing assets which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.

The sour mood in markets extended to cryptoassets, with bitcoin hitting a fresh two month low.Jason Da Silva, director, global investment strategy at Arbuthnot Latham, said stock markets were paying the price for bond yields soaring as economic data from the United States smash expectations, despite all the rate hikes so far.The MSCI All Country stock index was down 0.3%, hitting its lowest since early June after falling 5.85% during August, though it remains 10% up for the year.There was little market response to news of a package of measures from China's securities regulator to revive a sinking stock market.Story continuesTen-year U.S. Treasury yields eased 8 basis points to 4.2251%, after surging about 30 basis points this month alone to a 10-month top of 4.3280% and near the highest levels since 2007.Euro zone government bond yields also eased on Friday as concerns about the global economy nudged investors into safe-haven government bonds and further signs emerged that euro zone inflation has peaked.Britain's 10-year bond yield had risen on Thursday to its highest since 2008 at around 4.76%, but eased slightly on Friday as sterling softened.""The bond yields are saying you are probably going to have to keep rates higher for longer, and if growth starts to really pick up again, we might need to tighten further and stock markets are not liking that,"" Da Silva said.Minutes from the Federal Reserve this week showed most members of the rate-setting committee continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, suggesting more hikes are in the pipeline.Attention now turns to the Fed and other top central banks' annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, with investors set to scrutinise a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Aug. 25 for latest clues on potential rate hikes.Markets are already scaling back rate cuts bets next year.CHINA SHADOW BANKINGInvestors were keeping a close eye on the liquidity crunch that appeared to be spreading to China's vast shadow banking sector, with Zhongzhi, a major Chinese asset manager, telling investors it needs to restructure its debt.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9% to flirt with nine-month lows, bringing the total loss for the week to over 3%. That marked the third straight week of declines for the index.Chinese blue-chips dropped 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped another 2%, heading for the biggest weekly losses in two months.Shares of Chinese property developers listed in Hong Kong fell 2%, after China Evergrande filed for protection from creditors in a U.S. bankruptcy court.The onshore yuan moved away from a nine-month trough after the central bank set the daily fixing much higher than expected to support the currency, with traders on edge for any more direct intervention by Beijing or state-owned banks.Japan's Nikkei also lost 0.5%, heading for a weekly drop of 3.1%.Data on Friday showed Japan's core inflation slowed in July, a result that is likely to support market wagers that the Bank of Japan is in no hurry to phase out monetary easing.The U.S. dollar recovered from an earlier dip and was standing tall near a two-month top at 103.42 against its major peers. It was up about 0.5% on the week.The Japanese yen was trading at 145.39 against the dollar, having been hammered this week to a nine-month low of 146.56 per dollar as yield differentials between the U.S. and Japan widened. It is near levels that sparked an intervention by Japanese authorities late last year.Oil prices were lower. Brent crude futures eased 0.5% to $83.67 and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were off 0.4% at $79.99.The gold price was 0.2% higher at $1,892 per ounce.(Editing by Toby Chopra and Mark Potter)]"

The 320,000-bpd Shenghong refinery and PetroChina's 400,000-bpd Guangdong plant started commercial operations earlier this year, while Yulong Petrochemical's 400,000-bpd refinery is scheduled to start trial runs in the fourth quarter.""Almost all refineries in China are designed to process mainly medium sour crude oil,"" said a Chinese oil trader, adding that tight supply would depress margins at Chinese refineries already struggling with tepid product demand.Exports to key buyers - China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan - are expected to drop further from October once Kuwait resumes supply to its Vietnam joint venture Nghi Son refinery following two months of scheduled maintenance work.""The supply reduction in 2023 was factored in our term contract discussed last year,"" KY Lin, spokesperson at Taiwan Formosa Petrochemical Corp said, adding that negotiations for 2024 supply will commence soon.Formosa could replace Kuwaiti supply with grades such as Iraq's Basra Medium, Qatar's al-Shaheen and Oman crude, Lin said, adding it can also process U.S. light sweet crude.PRICES CLIMBMiddle East crude exports are expected to slump by nearly 8%, or up to 1.35 million bpd, in the second half of 2023 from the first half, said James Forbes, an analyst at FGE.Refiners are already feeling the pinch as Middle East producers have hiked official selling prices (OSPs) for July to September supplies.In signs supply is tightening, in August, benchmark Dubai's first month was trading $2.11 a barrel higher than the third month, compared with a difference of $1.14 in June.And the discount for sour Dubai crude against sweet Brent crude has narrowed sharply to around $1 a barrel from nearly $6 at the start of the year and briefly even fetched a small premium to Brent in June.""The Brent-Dubai spread has recently widened but we do see some potential to narrow again if Asian demand strengthens further,"" said Shah.(Reporting by Muyu Xu; Editing by Florence Tan and Sonali Paul)]"

A slump in U.S. production could exacerbate an anticipated supply tightness through the rest of this year.Those concerns, spurred on by output cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, helped oil prices gain for seven straight weeks since June. Brent crude gained about 18% and WTI gained 20% over the seven weeks ended Aug. 11.This week, however, oil prices dropped about 2% from last week, as a worsening property crisis in China added to concerns about the country's sluggish economic recovery and reduced investors appetite for risk across markets.""Concerns for investors remain focused on the tension between slowing global growth and still-tight global supplies,"" said Rob Haworth, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Asset Management.""Prices are likely to remain range-bound for now,"" Haworth said, adding that demand is in question for investors worried by the weak data from China.Concern is also mounting that the U.S. Federal Reserve has not finished raising interest rates to tackle inflation. Higher borrowing costs can impede economic growth and in turn reduce overall demand for oil.Oil benchmarks were further depressed by seasonal demand weakness heading into the autumn, said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management.Hatfield said he expects demand to hold up in China despite its slowing economy and forecast oil prices would trade between $75 to $90 a barrel over the coming months.(Reporting by Shariq Khan; Additional reporting by Natalie Grover, Paul Carsten and Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Jamie Freed, Conor Humphries, Jane Merriman and Barbara Lewis, David Gregorio)]"

It bought out Shell’s stake in the oil refining partnership in 2022.Each violation could carry a fine of up to $25,000 per day for each separate contaminant released in violation of the three laws, according to the filing.The fire on an olefins unit burned from May 5 to 7 and sent a cloud of the thick black smoke over east Houston, according to the lawsuit.Water used to fight the blaze and cool nearby equipment entered through a stormwater drainage system into the Houston Ship Channel between May 5 to 9 and through another part of the drainage system from May 5 to 26, according to the lawsuit.The second discharge was estimated to be 68.7 million gallons of water, according to the lawsuit.Provisional Texas Attorney General Angela Colmenero brought the lawsuit on behalf of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which enforces federal and state environmental laws.Shell is investigating the fire and will share its findings when the probe is finished, said spokesperson Curtis Smith said.“Seventy percent of the Deer Park site is operational,” Smith said. “Repair work on the damaged olefins unit has started and the plan is to have it up and running by the fourth quarter of this year.” (Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

But the two-day rise was too late and too little to make up for the losses in the first three days of the week.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled the latest session up 86 cents, or 1%, at $81.25 per barrel, extending Thursday’s 1.3%. But the 4.6% drop from Monday through Wednesday still left WTI down 2.3% on the week.That was a breakaway from a previous seven-week rally triggered by a bull fervor over Saudi production cuts that lifted the U.S. crude benchmark by 20% in that period, resulting in a 9-month high of $84.89 for a barrel.London-based Brent crude finished the New York session up 68 cents, or 0.8%, at $84.80, extending the prior day’s run by a similar percentage. For the week, Brent was down 2.8% after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return and a seven-month high of $88.10.U.S. oil demand is there but dollar strength a bigger worryU.S. oil demand has remained stable over the past few months, but markets have feared a potential decline in fuel consumption, especially as the end of the summer season approaches.“We believe that there is still room for the market to move higher. Our balance sheet suggests that the oil market will continue to tighten as we move through the second half of the year with a deficit in the region of 2MMbbls/d,” said analysts at ING, in a note.“We have left our forecasts for the remainder of the year unchanged. We still expect ICE Brent to average US$86/bbl over 3Q23 and US$92/bbl over 4Q23.”Still, weighing on crude prices are concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve is not quite finished with hiking interest rates to tackle inflation, especially after the release of hawkish Fed minutes this week.Story continuesResilience in the U.S. economy has helped the U.S. dollar post strong gains this week. Strength in the greenback also weighed on oil prices, given that it makes crude more expensive for international buyers.China, China and ChinaThat makes any crude price projection depend largely on what China does — or doesn’t do.The world’s second largest economy has been grappling with a slowing post-COVID economic recovery, exacerbated by weakness in its important property sector.This has raised concerns that this lower economic activity would hit demand for crude from a country that was meant to pick up a lot of the slack that tight monetary policies in the West have generated.The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly cut short and medium-term lending rates earlier this week, but investors are calling on more targeted, fiscal measures to support the economy.(Additional reporting by Peter Nurse in London and Ambar Warrick in Singapore)Related ArticlesOil wraps 7-week rally despite rising; All eyes on ChinaOil up 1% on signs of slow US output, posts first weekly loss in 8 weeksUS tightens export controls of nuclear power items to China]"

However, the bottom line reflects a decline of 11% from the year-ago quarter.As expected, the performance of the IB business was weak. While equity and fixed income underwriting fees increased 52% and 21%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter, advisory fees declined 24%. Therefore, total IB fees increased only marginally from the prior-year quarter.Further, because of subdued volatility and client activity, Morgan Stanley’s trading business performance was muted. Fixed-income trading revenues decreased 31% and equity trading income declined 14% year over year.Higher expenses and provisions were the other headwinds in the quarter.Despite a significant increase in interest income (driven by higher rates), the company’s net interest income (NII) declined year over year because of substantially higher interest expenses.Net income applicable to common shareholders was $2.05 billion, down 14% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $2.48 billion.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseNet revenues were $13.46 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion.NII was $2.01 billion, down 12% year over year. We had projected NII of $2.32 billion.Total non-interest revenues of $11.45 billion increased 6%.

Our estimate for expenses was $9.70 billion.Provision for credit losses was $161 million, up 59% from $101 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $123.4 million.Story continuesQuarterly Segment PerformanceInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income was $977 million, down 37% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same was $1.34 billion. Net revenues were $5.65 billion, down 8%. The downside resulted from a fall in advisory revenues, and fixed-income and equity trading revenues. We had projected total revenues to be $5.68 billion.Wealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $1.68 billion, up 11% year over year. Our estimate for the same was $1.86 billion. Net revenues were $6.66 billion, up 16%, driven by higher net interest income and transactional revenues. We had projected total revenues of $6.35 billion.Total client assets were $4.89 trillion as of Jun 30, 2023, up 15% year over year.Investment Management: Pre-tax income was $170 million, falling 32% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $202.6 million. Net revenues were $1.28 billion, down 9%. The fall was due to a decline in asset management and related fees, along with a fall in performance-based income and other income. We had projected total revenues of $1.33 billion.As of Jun 30, 2023, total assets under management or supervision were $1.41 trillion, up 5% from Jun 30, 2022.Capital Position ImprovesAs of Jun 30, 2023, the book value per share was $55.24, up from $54.46 in the corresponding period of 2022.

Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.9%, up from 15.5% a year ago.Share Repurchase UpdateIn the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley repurchased 12 million shares for $1 billion.2023 OutlookManagement anticipates incurring nearly $325 million of additional integration-related costs. These are likely to be evenly spread across quarters, with almost 2/3rd related to E*Trade and 1/3rd related to Eaton Vance. At the end of the first half of 2023, approximately $150 million of the above-mentioned charges remained.Management expects no further expansion in quarterly NII going forward.The tax rate is expected to be almost 23%.Long-Term ObjectivesThe company expects an ROTCE of 20% or more. The efficiency ratio is expected to be less than 70%.For the WM segment, the pre-tax margin is projected at more than 30%.

(NYSE: FE) subsidiary Penelec is on track this year to install about 350 automated ""TripSaver"" reclosing devices along neighborhood power lines in its service area to help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions. The programmable devices work like a circuit breaker in a home with the added benefit of automatically re-energizing a power line within seconds to keep power safely flowing to customers.Penelec Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""TripSavers can allow us to automatically restore service to customers rather than send a truck and crew to investigate the issue, which is especially useful in remote areas of Penelec's vast service territory,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""These devices are intended to provide safer and more efficient service restoration for both our employees and our customers.""Penelec is in the fourth year of its five-year program to install 2,000 TripSaver devices throughout its service area. The work falls under the company's Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), a $200 million initiative to accelerate capital investments through 2024 to help ensure continued electric service reliability for the company's 585,000 customers.This year, crews are scheduled to install TripSavers in and around the communities of Albion, Altoona, Bedford, Bradford, Corry, Dubois, Ebensburg, Erie, Indiana, Johnstown, Lewistown, Mansfield, Meadville, Montrose, Oil City, Phillipsburg, Shippensburg, Towanda and Warren.Utility crews place TripSavers on neighborhood distribution lines that branch off the main power line serving an area. When there is a temporary problem with the line, such as a tree limb contacting the line, the TripSaver can sense when the branch is gone and automatically re-energize the line to prevent an extended outage in the neighborhood – all in a matter of seconds.Story continuesIf the TripSaver detects a more serious issue, such as a fallen tree on the power line, it will isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers. The device's smart technology quickly pinpoints the location of the electrical fault and helps utility personnel better understand the cause of the outage to help speed restoration.Reliability engineers review outage information to identify the best locations for TripSavers, typically distribution lines with large customer counts in tree-filled areas. The new devices replace some older equipment used to isolate damage and limit the number of impacted customers.Penelec serves approximately 585,000 customers within 17,600 square miles of northern and central Pennsylvania. Follow Penelec on Twitter @Penelec and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/PenelecElectric.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Salesforce.com (CRM) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this customer-management software developer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 22.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 42% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.4%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Salesforce.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Salesforce.com a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Salesforce.com is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Has Salesforce.com (CRM) been one of those stocks this year?

The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks. Salesforce.com is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRM's full-year earnings has moved 7.9% higher. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.Based on the latest available data, CRM has gained about 56.1% so far this year. In comparison, Computer and Technology companies have returned an average of 34.3%. This means that Salesforce.com is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.Another stock in the Computer and Technology sector, Extreme Networks (EXTR), has outperformed the sector so far this year.

The company has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs.Accenture has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships. The company’s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential. Partly due to these tailwinds,However, on the flip side, pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, remains a concern.

It expects cash flow to decline this year.Its balance sheet with a rising debt level can affect financial flexibility. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

In addition, focus on lean operations to drive productivity, share gain initiatives in target end markets and continuing inventory optimization actions are driving the segment’s growth.The company’s efforts to deliver impressive free operating cash flow are noteworthy. Flowserve’s free cash flow increased 98.8% year over year in fiscal 2023 (ended June 2023) due to improved working capital, specifically from a lower inventory level. In the quarters ahead, the company expects to increase cash flow through margin expansion and working capital improvements, including inventory reductions.KMT’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Flowserve basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Flowserve, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for FlowserveThis company that makes pumps, valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries is expected to earn $1.97 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 79.1%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Flowserve. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Flowserve to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the stock market in general, then take a look at Stanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stocks. The high interest rate environment which started to take shape last year has not been great for the hedge fund industry. Most funds tend to do well when the stock market as a whole is rising, but the energy supply shocks of 2023 effectively bifurcated the stock market into two segments. These included growth stocks that fell as inflation rose and purchasing powers dropped, and traditional sectors such as petroleum, gas, and coal which rose as investors tried to profit from an effective reworking of the global energy market.The fall in the grace of growth stocks last year also took down several hedge funds with it. As a whole, the industry lost $208 billion in 2022, with funds such as Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global and Dan Loeb's Third Point Capital losing more than $20 billion cumulatively. For more details, you can check out 15 Best Hedge Funds to Work For.Amidst this turmoil, one hedge fund boss that remained relatively unscathed was Stanley Druckenmiller. Mr. Druckenmiller has decades of experience in the finance industry, and he set up his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, in 1981. He is also one of the most famous hedge fund investors in the history of the industry. While some of our readers might only be young enough to remember the British Pound's crash last year that nearly sent it to parity levels with the U.S. dollar, the British currency underwent similarly rapid depreciations in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Mr. Druckenmiller, working for George Soros at that time, capitalized on the latter when they correctly bet that the British government would be forced to devalue the Pound in 1992 and fail to meet the conditions for the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This netted them more than a billion dollars in profit.Story continuesThe hedge fund investor has since retired from managing investor capital after he closed down his fund in 2010 stating that the job became too stressful. Currently, he invests in the stock market through his family office, which also leaves him insulated against large scale capital withdrawal from hedge funds during times of crisis in the stock market such as the one that took place last year and in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus breakout.However, even though he has chosen to step back from the lucrative world of hedge fund investing, Mr. Druckenmiller still has his fingers on the pulse of the industry. 2023's first half has been a stunner for industry observers and investors, as, despite an uncertain U.S. economic outlook and high interest rates, indexes such as the NASDAQ 100, have posted stunning gains that have touched 45%. Much of these have been due to the hype in artificial intelligence. Speaking at an event in June, he shared insightful thoughts about artificial intelligence and its prospects, particularly during a potential recession.According to him:All of AI is not going to make it through whether we have a recession or not because they haven't separated the wheat from the chaff yet. But I do believe, unlike crypto, I think AI is real, it's probably, it could be as transformative as the Internet, it's a huge thing. And I think I've argued publicly that if staples can go up in price in a recession, why can't a company like NVIDIA if they go up; if they go up if their orders and earnings go up 70% in a hard landing - which is what I think would probably happen. It's not clear that NVIDIA goes down despite the lofty valuation level. History has proved that if you do, that if you have very good earnings in a recession, and they're sustainable, if they're not the market somehow figures it out, those stocks would do just fine. So we have some longs, we have some shorts, and the AI's sort of dominated the long portfolio for five or six months.So, what are Stanley Druckenmiller's latest investments?

48,dff51ab5-6b76-308e-a43a-4ebca5659ba3,MSFT,2023-08-18,Bill Gates Stock Portfolio: August 2023 Update,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-stock-portfolio-august-112713302.html,1692358033,STORY,"['MSFT', 'BRK-B', 'FDX', 'CNI', 'KOF', 'WMT', 'DE', 'ECL', 'BUD']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the August updates of Bill Gates' stock portfolio. If you want to skip out an introduction to the well known technology billionaire, then head on over to Bill Gates Stock Portfolio Latest 2023 Update: Top 5 Stocks.Bill Gates really needs no introduction. His company, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world and one that sits at the heart of the computing revolution that has taken the planet by storm.Mr. Gates' story is one of a typical Silicon Valley entrepreneur. He attended the illustrious Harvard University for his undergraduate education, but sensing an opportunity in the computing market, dropped out and set up Microsoft in 1976. During the first decade of its existence, Microsoft would compete with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the personal computing crown and these years would signify the different approaches to a product that Gates and his rival Steve Jobs would take. While Jobs would stress the need to control the entire user experience through his product and pair the Macintosh operating system with the Mac computer, Gates would instead focus on developing software that could be used on any computer. As history shows, Gates won this war, and Microsoft is currently the world's largest computer operating system company. Apple, however, came back with the smartphone as it became the first company to capture a large market with the iPhone.After working at Microsoft for nearly four decades, Gates left the firm in 2014. However, due to his stature in the industry and his active approach towards charity, he is still a regular feature of news pieces despite nearly ten years having passed since his retirement. The Microsoft billionaire, who is worth $116 billion as of August 2023, donates to charitable causes and invests primarily through his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Apart from the foundation, he also invests through his family office called Cascade Investment. If you're interested in his family office's investments, then check out Bill Gates’ Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. Story continuesMr. Gates' foundation is also one of the biggest charities in the world, and estimates suggest that through it, he has donated more than $50 billion to a variety of charitable causes over the past two decades. His friendship with another well-known charitable billionaire, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, is also well known and so is Mr. Buffett's influence on Mr. Gates' investment philosophy. As opposed to Gates, who is a technology billionaire, Mr. Buffett is an old school investor who finds value in a variety of sectors such as energy and finance. These choices often hedge investment losses in a market downturn in growth stocks such as the one we witnessed last year, and Mr. Buffett has also influenced the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's investments by quite a bit. Like his friend, Mr. Gates has also pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth once he passes away.These days the billionaire is busy being a celebrity and focusing on his interests. In August, he interviewed Khan Academy's founder Sal Khan as part of his Unconfuse Me podcast where the pair discussed a variety of topics. For those out of the loop, Khan Academy is the world's premier online education platform that is made of countless free courses to make sure that children all over the world can access education for free. During the talk, Gates shared his experience around ChatGPT's early days and how OpenAI stunned him when it demonstrated its software to him. The Microsoft founder linked the demo to the time he was at Xerox PARC in the 1970s, which is a big claim if you're in the loop about computing history. If you're not, then consider the fact that the graphical user interface (GUI) developed by Xerox PARC is the precursor to the modern computing operating systems that we use today. It had a simple point and click interface, which had left both Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs stunned when they first saw it - an understandable reaction considering how the software would become the backbone of the computer.Therefore, comparing the OpenAI demo with the Xerox demo is no short claim and it underscores the impact that Mr. Gates believes that OpenAI might have on the world. During his talk with Sal Khan, Mr. Gates recalled the two demonstrations and shared:In June, they kept showing me this thing, and I was like, ""Yeah, it’s kind of an idiot savant. I don’t think it’s practical. Why don’t you see if it can do the AP Biology exam. And I’m not going to pay any attention until you can get a 5."" And I thought, ""Okay, that’ll give me three years to work on HIV and malaria."" And then it was so bizarre because Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in late August said, ""Hey, we want to come show you this thing."" It was early September when there were like thirty people at my house. And I’ve said it’s the most stunning demo I’ve ever seen in my life. I mean, right up there with seeing the Xerox PARC graphics user interface that set the agenda for Microsoft for about fifteen years. This demo was so surprising to me, the emergent depth that as they scaled up the training set, its fluency, and you have to say understanding, that computers could not read in the sense humans do, and it couldn’t write in the sense humans do. And now, with lots of footnotes about hallucination and things like that, but I’m still personally in a state of shock at wow, it is so good, and okay, therefore, let’s see where we can put it to good use.So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the August update for Bill Gates' stock portfolio. The top three Bill Gates stock picks are Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI).Bill Gates Stock Portfolio: August 2023 UpdateOur Methodology To compile our list of stocks for the August update to Bill Gates' stock portfolio, we used the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Q2 2023 SEC filings and picked top ten stocks from the portfolio.

NYU Professor Vasant Dhar sits down with Yahoo Finance Live's Diane King Hall to discuss whether these AI jobs wages are wholly justified amid widespread artificial intelligence adoption and current labor market conditions.""Assuming [these companies] get some clarity around what AI really means for their business, these numbers are justified,"" Dhar states. ""Now, the trouble is that there's a high variance in people's abilities and skills to actually translate something into real sort of money, business profits.""Inversely, companies have sought value and efficiency through the adoption of AI models this year, resulting in layoffs and projected downsizing.""We should not conflate the ability of the computer to speak well with knowledge,"" Dhar says, adding: ""The thing to keep in mind is that these pre-trained models make it easy to build applications really quickly, but they'll inherit the limitations of these models.""Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Companies from entertainment to engineering are jumping on the AI bandwagon. And they are willing to pay big bucks to get ahead of the competition. Netflix recently posted a senior role in machine learning with a pay range offering up to get this-- $900,000. Here to discuss more is AI Researcher and Professor at NYU's business school Stern, Vasant Dhar. Thank you so much for joining us today, professor. So let's--VASANT DHAR: Great to be here, Diane.DIANE KING HALL: Thank you. And let's get right into this. So this was-- when I saw this number-- and, of course, there are other high-paying jobs in this industry. But that one really jumped out to me. What do you make of that-- $900,000 for an AI role?VASANT DHAR: Yeah, how about that? It's-- you know, this reminds me of Wall Street in the '90s, right? It's just sort of musical chairs. Now, it's big tech. And it just tells you what, you know, someone really good is worth to these companies. So yeah, I mean, the stakes are high. So people out there are saying, we need to do something. We need to get really good people. And let's pay them, right? So that's what you're seeing here.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: So the stakes are high. But this-- you know, especially when it comes to generative AI, to us, this is a newer kind of frontier. You don't have that many companies that are at the leader of the pack. So how do they know this is the value that this role should have?VASANT DHAR: Well, you know-- I mean, that's a great question. So assuming that companies know what they're doing and what they want to do with AI, which is a big assumption-- you know, because what I see is people sort of scrambling and saying, hey, we need to do something. But it's not clear what they want to do.But assuming that they get some clarity around what AI really means for their business, then these numbers are justified, right? Because the value that someone really good can bring to the table is awesome. Now, the trouble is that there's a lot-- there's a high variance in people's abilities and skills to actually translate something into real sort of money, business profits.So it's not easy to get the right person. But if you can get the right person, then yeah, that-- you know, the right person is worth that kind of money. I mean, you can't pay people enough, the right people enough for this thing. There are lots of people out there. But getting the right people, that's the challenge.DIANE KING HALL: And one of the things we're showing right now is a graphic of some of the job opportunities that are out there within AI. And these are on the lower end of the range we're discussing for--VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: --you know, from jobs paying in the $200,000 range to the $400,000 range. So not quite at that Netflix level of $900,000. So what kind of-- and the companies that probably come to mind for you or, say, an NVIDIA, what kind of companies really kind of understand this best versus companies that are like, to your point, we just-- we got to get in on this?VASANT DHAR: Well, the majority fall in the second category, right? So most people are saying, we need to do something, but it isn't clear what they need to do, while you have some companies who are the leaders and AI is their business, right? So Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon. You know, AI is their business. And so they've got the skills. They've got the best talent. And they have no difficulty attracting good talent.But regular companies, yeah, they have a hard time attracting that kind of talent. So they're willing to pay up.DIANE KING HALL: And I want to ask you really quickly, the flip of this is-- there was a report out earlier this week about a percentage of companies that have replaced jobs with AI, with the generative AI, you know, kind of the technology versus a person. How effective do you think that can actually be, especially when you also have some issues with regard to AI doing what it says it can do, the problem with making stuff up, the hallucination effect?VASANT DHAR: OK, well, there's the-- there are two sort of-- there were two parts to your question.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.VASANT DHAR: And I've already forgotten the first one because the hallucinations are so--DIANE KING HALL: Let's say-- let's go with hallucination and talk about that piece because there was a report out today about issues like with OpenAI--VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: --you know--VASANT DHAR: Right.DIANE KING HALL: --these models tested for hallucinations.VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: And--VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: --they were given questions. And they got it wrong.VASANT DHAR: Yeah, but we shouldn't be surprised, right? We should not conflate the ability of the computer to speak well with knowledge, right? It's like-- you know, someone just said that it's like an alien species that's descended on Earth. And they speak such good English that we think they know everything. And they don't.Like, we should not be surprised that they get a lot of things wrong just like people do, right? People get all kinds of things wrong. So why should you expect ChatGPT to get everything right? Because it's been trained on everything out there, right? It's learned truths, falsehoods, slurs, everything, right?And these are these sort of-- you know, what are called pre-trained models that have been trained on everything out there. And then you get applications built on top of them like ChatGPT, where you sort of train it to talk in a certain way. But it inherits all of the, you know, sort of limitations of these sort of pre-trained models that it's built on.And that's the thing to keep in mind is that, yeah, these pre-trained models make it easy to build applications really quickly. But they'll inherit the limitations of these models. And, you know, one of the sort of big limitations of this current, sort of, paradigm is that despite the really impressive things that AI is accomplished-- you know, and the most impressive one is the fact that a machine can actually talk to you-- it has huge limitations, right? It-- there are lots of things that it doesn't know. And we don't know the things that it doesn't know.DIANE KING HALL: All right.VASANT DHAR: So it becomes hard to trust it. It's like talking to someone really intelligent, but you don't really know whether you should trust them all the time.DIANE KING HALL: That's right. Well, we will have to put a pin in that and explore the trust question later. Professor Vasant Dhar from NYU Stern, we appreciate you Thank you.]"

One such stock that merits attention is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). The stock, which is currently priced at 27.42, recorded a loss of 2.73% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 13.12%. The stock's fair valuation is $45.66, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBA. Click here to check it out. WBA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WBAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): A Potential Value Trap?Considering the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Walgreens Boots Alliance should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.78. These indicators suggest that Walgreens Boots Alliance, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Walgreens Boots Alliance: A Company OverviewWalgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the U.S., with over 8,500 locations. Nearly three quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens location. Roughly two thirds of revenue is generated from prescription drug sales; Walgreens makes up 20% of total prescription revenue in the U.S. Walgreens also generates sales from retail products (general wellness consumables and its own branded merchandise), European drug wholesale, and healthcare. With more locations incorporating additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical, Walgreens creates an omnichannel experience for patients and positions itself as a one-stop healthcare provider.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): A Potential Value Trap?Breaking Down Walgreens Boots Alliance's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Altman Z-score reveals Walgreens Boots Alliance's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Walgreens Boots Alliance's historical data, 2021: 0.38; 2022: 0.42; 2023: 0.34, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Walgreens Boots Alliance's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.07; 2023: -0.05) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Walgreens Boots Alliance is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.44; 2022: 1.48; 2023: 1.43 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Walgreens Boots Alliance's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Conclusion: Is Walgreens Boots Alliance a Value Trap?In light of the evidence, it seems that Walgreens Boots Alliance, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, may indeed be a potential value trap. The company's declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, decreasing EBIT to Total Assets ratio, and recent drop in asset turnover suggest potential financial distress and operational inefficiencies. These factors, combined with its low Altman Z-Score, indicate that the company may be at risk of financial instability. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in Walgreens Boots Alliance.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Compare this to the fact that the highest prevalence rates of health disparities are observed in racial and ethnic minority groups.Because of this, improving diversity in clinical trials can be-at its most literal-a matter of life and death. And it's a mission that Walgreens has put at the forefront of its U.S. Healthcare strategy.To spread the word about the importance of representation in clinical trials, Walgreens focused part of its sponsorship at this year's Black Women's Expo on educating the community about how participation from people of all races can move us closer to achieving more equitable health outcomes. Additionally, diverse Walgreens suppliers, beauty consultants and pharmacists were on hand to celebrate and empower the health of Black women.Alethia Jackson, SVP, ESG and chief DEI officer for the U.S. at Walgreens Boots Alliance, cut the ribbon to kick off the 28th year of the expo.Joining Jackson at the expo was Kendal Whitlock, head of digital optimization, clinical trials at WBA.Whitlock, who holds a master's degree in public health and has spent 20 years working in the pharmaceutical industry, wants people to understand that misgivings are understandable, but through clinical trial participation, you can be a catalyst for improving health in your community.""There's a foundational lack of knowledge of what clinical trials are among the public. Candidly, people think they're guinea pigs,"" says Whitlock. ""On top of that, there is a history of 350 years of transgressions against people's bodies-it's not just Henrietta Lacks and it's not just Tuskegee, but worldwide. So whether it's a lack of access to research professionals, the inconvenience of traveling to clinical sites, or maybe physician populations are short on time-but whatever the reason, it leaves people with gaps in understanding the process.""Story continuesWhitlock joined Walgreens clinical trials team members Jim Carroll, head of real world evidence; Scott Chavers, senior director, epidemiology; Iyue Sung, director, clinical data sciences, and Mindy Bertram, director, patient recruitment and retention, as well as pharmacists and diverse suppliers in Walgreens booth at the expo to answer questions visitors had about clinical trials and explain how they could get involved.Pharmacists at the expo provided more than 5,600 health services, including immunizations, blood pressure screenings, and health and medical consultations to attendees. Pharmacists Cornetta Levi and Latasha Guy helped to perform these services and took part in a mainstage presentation about achieving healthcare equity through local pharmacy access.Whitlock joined Levi and Guy in the presentation to share critical data like the fact that only 5 percent of all people participate in clinical trials. In other words, the development of drugs and other therapies are based on a fraction of peoples' physical reactions and genetics, leaving physicians less equipped to speak to the effect they may have on Black people.Whitlock hopes attendees left the conference feeling more educated and empowered to learn more about their health and how that can lead to improved research in clinical trials.""We hope people came away educated and empowered so that they can have agency in their health journey,"" said Whitlock. ""Patients need to understand the relevance because if they ask their provider if a medical product was developed with patients like them, and the provider can't give a definitive yes or no, then the patient is less adherent to that medication. And then the outcomes of whatever they're managing, say it's something like hypertension, are less controlled. So, not having that evidence is a lose-lose. It's not only a scientific imperative, but a moral imperative to diversify clinical trials so that the experience of managing illness is equitable.""Click here to learn more about clinical trials with Walgreens from Kendal Whitlock.Kendal Whitlock, head of digital optimization, clinical trials at Walgreens Boots Alliance, speaks in Walgreens presentation, ""Local Healthcare Reimagined,"" at the 2023 Black Women's Expo.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Walgreens Boots AllianceWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-allianceEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Walgreens Boots AllianceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/774827/Bridging-the-Knowledge-Gap-About-Diversity-in-Clinical-Trials]"

Ex-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker are board members.The complaints come as many experts expect an uptick in challenges to corporate diversity programs following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that prohibited race-conscious college admissions policies.The growing scrutiny underscores competing pressures that companies face to implement diversity initiatives but also to rein them in amid conservative backlash, according to Rick Rossein, a professor at the City University of New York School of Law. Legal complaints like the ones filed by America First could drive employers to be more cautious, he said.“There certainly is a deep psychological effect that is putting the brakes on the forward movement of diversity in the workplace,” Rossein said.America First's complaints cite a range of hiring, promotion and contracting programs. They include a Starbucks initiative designed to boost diversity in senior leadership and McDonald's policy of evaluating executives based in part on their efforts to diversify the company's workforce.Story continuesAmerica First has also filed lawsuits accusing Target Corp and Progressive Insurance of breaching their duties to shareholders by adopting diversity programs and progressive marketing campaigns, for instance celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month.Kellogg said in a statement it complies with employment laws and has anti-discrimination policies in place. Hershey said in a statement it does not tolerate discrimination and that ""we believe our business is stronger when we are inclusive.""Activision and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.It is difficult to say whether the EEOC, which enforces federal laws banning workplace discrimination and currently has a Democratic majority, will take up America First's complaints.The agency's investigations are typically triggered by complaints from workers. But its five commissioners, who are appointed by the president, can bring their own complaints that can lead to probes and lawsuits.So-called ""commissioner's charges"" are relatively rare, with 29 filed last year, up from only three in each of the previous two years.Commissioner Andrea Lucas, a Trump appointee, filed a dozen charges last year, more than any of her colleagues. Lucas has said poorly-planned diversity programs can be illegal, and that the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action should be a wake-up call to employers that they cannot include race or gender preferences in workplace policies.Lucas declined to comment on whether she is considering filing charges against any company relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. EEOC commissioners are legally barred from confirming the existence of a specific charge or investigation.Gene Hamilton, America First's vice president and general counsel and a former Trump administration lawyer, said in a statement that it was patently illegal for companies to ""obsess"" over the demographics of their workforces.""Major corporations ... apparently do not care as much about the quality of the products that they make, but the race and sex of the employees who make their products,"" he said.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at some more ETFs, go directly to the 5 Best Consumer Staples ETFs.Consumer staples are an integral part of the average person's daily life, encompassing essential items we depend on regularly. These include necessities like food and beverages, personal care items, household and cleaning products such as paper goods, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and cosmetics.As previously mentioned in one of our articles, the consumer staples sector demonstrated remarkable performance in 2022, even in the face of elevated inflation. By December 9, 2022, the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index had achieved a gain of 0.37%, contrasting with the substantial 16.17% decline observed in the S&amp;P 500, as reported earlier.The purchase of consumer staples remains consistent regardless of the economic conditions, with a relatively stable quantity being bought during both prosperous and challenging times. For instance, the data presented by Hargreaves Lansdown reveals a compelling trend. During the height of the stock market's impact due to the coronavirus pandemic, the FTSE All Share Index experienced a substantial drop of 29.5% by March 18, 2020. In stark contrast, within the same timeframe, the consumer staples sector exhibited a significantly milder decline of just 13.24%, underscoring its resilience even in the face of significant market challenges. This sets the consumer staples sector apart from consumer discretionary enterprises like restaurants, hotels, and apparel, as well as consumer durables—durable goods such as furniture and electronics—that are more sensitive to market fluctuations. However, this stability often entails a trade-off, as significant explosive growth prospects are limited. This compromise is the inconspicuous price for enjoying stability during periods of uncertainty. Additionally, in the event of an economic upturn, other market sectors are poised to reap greater benefits compared to this particular industry.Story continuesRisk-averse investors looking to secure their investments against inflation can opt to increasing their exposure to the consumer staples sector by choosing consumer staples ETFs instead of investing in individual consumer staples stocks. A consumer staples ETF is an investment vehicle that focuses on consumer staples equities. ETFs have gained popularity over the years for several reasons. They offer diversification, allowing investors to access a range of stocks through a single investment, eliminating the need to purchase each stock separately. Furthermore, ETFs provide greater stability due to their lower volatility compared to individual stocks.When it comes to discussing the consumer staples industry, it's worth examining the perspective of one of the global giants in the consumer staples sector, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), regarding the industry's prospects for the current year. As stated by its management:These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7.4% reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales.Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year’s elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double-digits in food categories. It’s important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains and grocery continued, including from higher income households as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience.Best Consumer Staples ETFsPhoto by Fikri Rasyid on UnsplashNotable examples of consumer staples ETFs encompass the iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC), among other options.Our MethodologyWe have curated a selection of ETFs that provide access to consumer staples stocks across various market capitalizations, including large-, mid-, and small-cap companies. This compilation aims to encompass a comprehensive array of well-regarded funds listed on US exchanges. Moreover, we have mentioned the top holdings of these ETFs, which includes the likes of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), to provide more insight to prospective investors. Notably, these energy ETFs have achieved noteworthy growth over the past 5 years. The list is organized in ascending order based on the 5-year performance as of August 14, 2023.Best Consumer Staples ETFs10. iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 18.75%The iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI) replicates the performance of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Consumer Staples Sector Index. This consumer staples-oriented ETF provides investors with the opportunity to invest in businesses located across diverse countries, including the United States, Switzerland, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The encompassed companies comprise food manufacturers, distributors, producers of nondurable household goods, and enterprises involved in food and drug retailing. Established in August 2018, the fund currently manages assets worth $1.483 billion.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the top stocks in iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI)’s portfolio. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stands as a multinational consumer goods corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was established in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The corporation offers branded consumer packaged goods on a global scale, functioning through distinct segments including Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. During fiscal Q3 2023, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) recorded a 3.5% year-over-year growth in revenue, amounting to $20.07 billion. The company’s operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Similar to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in.9. Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 21.34%The basis of the Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL) lies in the Dorsey Wright® Consumer Staples Technical Leaders Index. Typically, the fund will allocate at least 90% of its overall assets to the securities constituting the Index.

Cosmetics, e.l.f. Skin, Well People, and Keys Soulcare. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) anticipates net sales for fiscal 2024 to fall within the bracket of $705 million to $720 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $637.72 million. Similarly, the projected range for adjusted diluted earnings per share is set at $1.73 to $1.76, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.64.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines (IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF). Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”8. Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 30.06%The foundation of the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) lies in the S&amp;P SmallCap 600® Capped Consumer Staples Index.

The company will see its first ever leadership transition in 2024 as the current CEO Aart de Geus steps down. It also just released fourth quarter numbers, beating on EPS and reporting record quarterly revenue.The company also raising its full year revenue guidance on strong design activity. Let's bring in current COO and President of Synopsys, the man who is going to be taking over as CEO as of January 1, that's Sassine Ghazi, to discuss more. Sassine, thank you so much for being here. First of all, congratulations on stepping into that CEO role as of early next year.First of all, just to sort of set the table for our viewers here as to where Synopsys sits in the semiconductor ecosystem, if you will, your clients are some of the big semiconductor makers. Talk to us about what services you provide to them to help them on their manufacturing journey.SASSINE GHAZI: Sure, Julie. First, thank you for having me. So what Synopsys does, we really think of us as the work engine for the semiconductor engineers. Meaning, customers like the NVIDIA, Apple, Intel, Samsung, et cetera. Anybody who design and develop a chip, they use Synopsys software to architect and actually design and verify the chip.Story continuesAnd if you talk to any of those customers, we are very well-known by every engineer in the semiconductor space all the way up to their CEOs. Because we're very critical to determine their competitiveness and their schedule and product differentiation.- What kind of demand or boom are you now seeing within the chip space of just people who are looking for chips that are relevant for AI needs?SASSINE GHAZI: So there are two factors that are happening really around us when it comes to chip demand. One, everything is smart, right? So your smart car, smart home, et cetera. So it's demanding a big need for more sophisticated semiconductor chips. The other mega trend that's super exciting is AI. With AI, in order to make it happen in reality, you need more sophisticated chips in the cloud or in the data center, as well as more sophisticated chips on the edge. With those two factors, the demand for semiconductor is unprecedented.JULIE HYMAN: And I was trying to-- as I was reading through your earnings and looking through the call here as well, I was trying to understand sort of the quantification of AI and its importance to you up to this point. You guys said on the call that on a trailing 12-month basis, that AI chips account for about half a billion dollars. Now, that's still not very much of your overall revenue to be clear here. So what is sort of the opportunity? How quickly is it moving? And how is it being used?SASSINE GHAZI: So yes, you're right. But 10% of the company's revenue today is attributed to AI chip designs. Now, if you look at the macro demand for AI, I believe we all agree that demand is in early stage and is going to continue on expanding as more and more applications uses AI.And more and more applications means you need more and more compute. Therefore, in order to design the chip that goes into that compute, you need more and more Synopsys software in order to enable it. So the half a billion or 10% of the company is, I want to say, in early stages with an expectation to continue on growing very nicely.JULIE HYMAN: And I think what people are trying to understand right now is, if I may-- I believe one of your clients, NVIDIA, really changed the way that people were thinking about AI when it came out last quarter with its forecast. And now, it feels like investors are trying to figure out where are the opportunities beyond that where companies are seeing real revenue right now. So can you put that in perspective for us? Not just for you all, but what you're seeing among your clients.SASSINE GHAZI: The more applications you have for AI. So one of the big application that we all get excited about and it became understood is ChatGPT, for example. But that's one application. There are many, many other application in the generative AI space or in the overall acceleration of efficiency and productivity. It can be in any market. Industrial, medical, et cetera. And for these markets, we are in that early stage of adoption towards these two vectors. Either a productivity push or ability to use AI in order to accelerate product development.So in that scope, Julie, is where we see the opportunity. And that's why I keep emphasizing. It's still in an early stage of enablement and deployment from an AI application standpoint.- When you go about designing chips, especially considering the amount of fabrication capacity that's going to be brought online within the next couple of years, how do you have to think through the natural resources that you're tapping into as well and really kind of lean into where there is an abundance of those resources so that you have a chip that is actually making it through the fabrication processes at scale?SASSINE GHAZI: Excellent question. I don't know if you have seen on Monday, we announced a very strategic partnership with Intel. And the primary motivation behind that partnership-- as you know, Intel and number of other manufacturing companies got money from the CHIPS Act. So that money is to build out a fab or a manufacturing capacity.But that capacity means nothing unless you're able to put chips into it. And we are the company that will be enabling Intel and other manufacturer to be bridging between the manufacturing and the chip developer like the AMD, the NVIDIA, et cetera, to take those chips to those fabs. In that context, AI plays a huge role.Because when you look at the engineers available to develop and design these chips, they're at all time shortage. We don't have enough engineers to develop them. And this is where Synopsys plays a huge role in the automation and modernization of the chip design. So with AI, you can actually implement AI for chip design where you can reduce the tasks from many engineers to fewer engineers in a much shorter time.And that's where the disruption and the inflection point is happening due to AI for chip design to support this increased demand due to cloud compute, autonomous driving, et cetera, et cetera.JULIE HYMAN: Sassine, finally, I want to ask you about the leadership transition, right? You are only the second CEO that this company has ever had, is my understanding. The founder of the company is stepping down as CEO to become executive chairman. What are your thoughts on taking the helm there, and what's sort of your high-level goal for where you want to take the company in the next phase?SASSINE GHAZI: So Aart started the company 37 years ago, and it's so rare to have a founder remaining CEO for 37 years with a lot of energy and vitality. I've been in the company for 25 years. So I did not join yesterday, and we have an amazing company. And that's why I've been here for 25 years.Now, as we transition between Aart and I, I'm looking forward to continuing the momentum that we have created and the pace to support the growth that we see in our market. If you look at the last few years, we were able to grow the company actually in three years, about 17% kegger and improve EPS by 26%. We just reported Q3, which is a record quarter. So it's a perfect time to go into that transition and continue that pace and momentum moving forward.JULIE HYMAN: Well Sassine, we really appreciate the opportunity to catch up with you as you prepare for that transition. Sassine Ghazi, Synopsys COO and President soon to be CEO as of January 1. Thank]"

The airline filed an appeal with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.Some legal experts have criticized Starr for ordering the Southwest lawyers to undergo training by a group that is aligned with a particular facet of one religion. The leader of Fix the Court, a small, nonpartisan group known mostly for monitoring the U.S. Supreme Court, filed a judicial-misconduct petition against the judge.A jury ruled last year that Southwest and the Transport Workers Union had violated the flight attendant's rights by firing her over religious speech, and she won a judgment of roughly $800,000.

73,d1dc0019-bad1-3fd4-bb14-a9c7e943eb09,HCA,2023-08-18,Here's Why Encompass Health (EHC) Stock is a Strong Buy Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-encompass-health-ehc-161300052.html,1692288780,STORY,"['EHC', 'HCA']","[Encompass Health Corporation EHC is well-poised to grow on the back of expanding patient volumes and revenues per discharge. Its prudent acquisition strategy also continues to aid its Inpatient Rehabilitation business.Outperformer &amp; Zacks RankOver the past year, shares of Encompass Health have gained 32.9%, outperforming the industry’s 9.1% decline. Headquartered in Birmingham, AL, EHC operates as a provider of post-acute healthcare services. With a market cap of $7.1 billion, it has a strong foothold in the domestic market.Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is worth adding to your portfolio at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EHC’s current-year earnings is pegged at $3.36 per share, which has witnessed five upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against none in the opposite direction. The estimate indicates 17.9% year-over-year growth. Encompass Health beat on earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed once, the average being 14%.Encompass Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEncompass Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEncompass Health Corporation price-eps-surprise | Encompass Health Corporation QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues is pegged at $4.8 billion. Rising inpatient and outpatient revenues will likely support its top-line growth. Our estimate for inpatient revenues for 2023 suggests 9.5% year-over-year growth.Improving discharge figures and revenues per discharge are expected to be major drivers for the company. We expect total discharges to rise more than 8% year over year in 2023. Its focus on boosting the number of licensed beds and hospitals will likely enhance market density, increasing overlap with the company’s in-patient rehabilitation facilities and building scale.The company has opened five de novos in the first half of this year, adding a total of 259 beds. It intends to add two more de novos and 31 beds to its existing hospitals in the remaining part of the year. Furthermore, it plans to add around 140 beds to existing facilities in 2024. These additions will boost EHC’s capacity and enable it to capture a bigger share in a highly fragmented market. This is crucial as the demand for such services is continuously increasing.Story continuesDue to improving operations, EHC now expects 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be within $920-$950 million, up from the prior guidance of $870-$910 million. The midpoint of the revised guidance indicates a 14.1% jump from the year-ago level.A RiskHowever, there is a factor that investors should keep a careful eye on.Encompass Health’s long-term debt-to-capitalization of 57.6% is much higher than the industry average of 46%. At second-quarter end, it had cash and cash equivalents of $117.5 million while long-term debt, net of current portion, was $2,697.6 million. Building pressure on the balance sheet is likely to affect its growth initiatives. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the medical space are Atai Life Sciences N.V. ATAI, Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM and HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Atai Life Sciences’ current year earnings indicates a 16.3% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. It has witnessed four upward estimate revisions over the past week against no movement in the opposite direction. ATAI beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Select Medical’s 2023 earnings indicates a 56.9% year-over-year increase to $1.93 per share. It has witnessed one upward estimate revision over the past month against no movement in the opposite direction. SEM beat earnings estimates in one of the last four quarters, met once and missed on the remaining occasions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 bottom line suggests a 9.1% increase from the prior-year levels.

74,5cf891a2-7a56-3756-9f79-59cb2bf916c7,HCA,2023-08-18,Is HCA (HCA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hca-hca-buy-wall-street-133007782.html,1692279007,STORY,['HCA'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about HCA Healthcare (HCA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.HCA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 75% and 10% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HCABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HCACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for HCA here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying HCA, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is HCA Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for HCA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.8% over the past month to $18.43.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for HCA. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for HCA may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PPG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-decent-financials-market-101606051.html,1692353766,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) has had a rough month with its share price down 8.8%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to PPG Industries'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PPG Industries is:17% = US$1.4b ÷ US$7.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.PPG Industries' Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo begin with, PPG Industries seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. However, we are curious as to how the high returns still resulted in flat growth for PPG Industries in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 13% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PPG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is PPG Industries Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 45% (implying that the company keeps 55% of its income) over the last three years, PPG Industries has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, PPG Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 26%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like PPG Industries has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

Higher volumes and pricing are also likely to support its results.The company remains focused on its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flows. APD is realizing the benefits of the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in Saudi Arabia. The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2027) $31.8 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value.Air Products is also driving productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead.The company also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. APD, earlier this year, increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.75 per share from $1.62 per share. This marked the 41st straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay more than $1.5 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2023.Slowdown in Europe &amp; China, Currency Pose HeadwindsAir Products is exposed to headwinds from unfavorable currency translation. The company saw currency headwinds in its Asia segment in the fiscal third quarter due to the weakening of Asian currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which reduced its sales and EBITDA for the unit by 5% in the quarter. It is likely to face continued currency headwinds in the fiscal fourth quarter.The slowdown in China and Europe may also affect the company’s business in these regions. The cooling China economy might impact volumes in the Industrial Gases - Asia segment. Air Products is also seeing weak demand for merchant products in Europe.

It focuses on maintaining cost and operational discipline. The company is realizing a full $300 million EBITDA run rate benefit from restructuring programs being initiated in the third quarter of 2020.The company also expects its investment in digital initiatives to drive efficiency and allow it to realize $300 million EBITDA run rate by the end of 2023. The company is also implementing targeted actions focused on optimizing labor and purchased service costs, lowering turnaround spending and boosting productivity.

It delivered $250 million of savings under this program in the second quarter of 2023.Moreover, DOW remains focused on investing in attractive areas through highly accretive projects. It is investing in several high-return growth projects including the expansion of downstream silicones capacity.The company completed its Fort Saskatchewan expansion in 2021, which is expected to support higher polyethylene demand. The company also commissioned its fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation pilot plant in Louisiana in fourth-quarter 2022 to manufacture propylene for coatings, electronics and durables markets.

The company expects the Decarbonize and Grow strategy to increase underlying earnings by $3 billion annually.Story continuesWeak Demand AilsDow faces headwinds from weaker demand in Europe and Asia Pacific. Lower consumer spending amid inflationary pressures is affecting demand in Europe. Global industrial activities have been affected by the weaker demand recovery in China. In the Performance Materials &amp; Coatings segment, the company is seeing weaker demand in consumer electronics and industrial end markets.Inflationary pressures are also impacting consumer durables and building and construction demand in Europe, affecting the Industrial Intermediates &amp; Infrastructure segment.

This forecast comes as mortgage rates remain elevated and home prices are freezing potential home buyers out of the real estate market. Yahoo Finance Reporter Dani Romero explains the inventory conditions in housing markets and breaks down affordability trends for prospective home buyers and renters.Video Transcript- The housing market has been worrying investors and consumers all year and Goldman Sachs recently revised its forecast for home prices. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero to break it all down for us. Hey, Dani.DANI ROMERO: Hi there, Rochelle. Well, Goldman Sachs is changing its call. The team there is forecasting that home prices will rise about 1.8% this year. That's different from their previous call where they thought that home prices would fall about 2.2%. Why does this matter? Well, with home prices going up and mortgage rates hovering around that 7%, home ownership is really looking bleak for a lot of Americans.Goldman's team has previously thought that rising mortgage rates would cause home prices to go down. Well, home prices have fallen about 13% from last year's peak but prices are still higher by about 26% than they were during the first quarter of 2020. Now with mortgage rates rising, home prices also moving upward due to that lack of supply. It's time to change that call. So to give you some perspective, inventory for homes on sale sits at 1 million compared to what it was before the pandemic where it was closer to that 2 million mark. So still not enough homes listed for sale right now, Rochelle.- And Dani, rents are also causing a lot of concern. What is Goldman saying about the rental affordability?DANI ROMERO: Homeowners will-- rents. There's going a lot more people are going to be staying in the rental market. Home ownership is such a great way to build wealth. But not a lot of people can afford a home right now. And so that's keeping a lot of people in the rental market, keeping those prices elevated. That means that that's also adding to the inflation picture.So the tension between homeowners who like rising home prices because it helps with their home equity and potential buyers who obviously want those home prices to be lower, that means that affordability will be a discussion on Capitol Hill. Especially as we head into this election year, we might hear a lot of these home associations really lobbying for some changes. An example of that is some tax incentives when it comes to investors, real estate investors. So that might be something that we hear down the line, Rochelle.- Yeah, people are certainly going to need some incentives to give up their comfortable mortgage rates and have to end up paying more if they have to move. Appreciate that update there. Our very own Dani Romero.]"

Sixth Street, an investment firm, is leading a consortium to buy GreenSky which includes KKR, PIMCO and CardWorks, the people said. Apollo Global Management is also vying for Greensky but is not part of the Sixth Street group, they said. Warburg Pincus is not involved in the auction, a different person said.Goldman is weighing different options for GreenSky, the people said. It could sell the GreenSky platform and loan book to one party, or it could offload the platform to one party and sell the loan book to another. Or Goldman could sell the platform and keep the existing loan book. Goldman received different bids for the different the options and it's unclear how the offers line up. Proposals came in at between $500 million to $1 billion, one of the bankers said, while others said the bids were half of what Goldman paid in 2022, they said. (The GreenSky acquisition was initially valued at $2.24 billion in September 2021 but dropped to $1.7 billion when the transaction closed the following March.)It’s unlikely there will be a third round of bidding for GreenSky. ""They need to finish,” one of the people said.“This is a super long, long process,” said one banker, who wasn’t involved in the auction.Founded in 2006, GreenSky is a fintech that helps consumers get home improvement loans. The company went public in 2018, raising $874 million. Goldman Sachs served as the lead underwriter on the GreenSky IPO. In 2022, Goldman acquired the company and GreenSky joined its consumer banking platform, which included Marcus. GS has since opted to exit parts of the consumer banking business and moved GreenSky to its Platform Solutions unit. In April, the bank confirmed that it was seeking a buyer for GreenSky. Months later, in July, Goldman said it took a $504 million writedown tied to the GreenSky business and $485 million in impairments related to its real estate investments, according to the firm’s second quarter earnings announcement.Story continuesThe current sale of GreenSky gives Apollo another chance to buy GreenSky, which was up for sale in 2019. Late that year, Goldman made a $7 a share, or about $1.3 billion cash offer to buy GreenSky, according to a regulatory filing. The process went dormant after Goldman refused to raise its bid and GreenSky ended up calling off the auction in August 2020, the filing said. In mid-2021, Goldman resumed talks to buy GreenSky and the discussions heated up after a private equity firm, identified in the filing as ""Financial Sponsor D,” made an offer to buy the lender. The unnamed private equity firm, which the Wall Street Journal reported was Apollo, tried to preempt the process and then engaged in a bidding war with Goldman for GreenSky, according to the filing. Goldman Sachs ended up winning the process, agreeing to buy GreenSky for about $12.15 a share in September 2021, the filing said. It completed the acquisition in March 2022. Roughly one year later, in April, Goldman confirmed that it had put GreenSky up for sale.Founded in 1990, Apollo is one of the original private equity firms that has expanded into credit and real estate. The firm, which had $617 billion in assets under management as of June 30, closed its merger with insurer Athene in January 2022. After failing to buy GreenSky, Apollo scooped up Aqua Finance, a consumer lending platform, in November 2021.Sixth Street, a well-known lender to businesses, has deep ties to Goldman Sachs. Alan Waxman, who is Sixth Street’s CEO, is a former Goldman partner and ex-head of special situations groups for the Americas. Waxman helped launch Sixth Street in 2009 with nine other executives, including several from Goldman. Sixth Street currently has about $70 billion in assets under management and employs roughly 500 people. In addition to direct lending, Sixth Street provides growth capital to companies, invests in infrastructure and real estate, and has expanded to insurance and structured products. Investments for Sixth Street include Airbnb, TIAA Bank, Real Madrid soccer club and the San Antonio Spurs.In August, Julian Salisbury, the former CIO of Goldman’s asset and wealth management division, agreed to join Sixth Street as a partner and co-CIO along with Waxman and Joshua Easterly, co-president and co-founder. (Easterly, who runs Sixth Street’s direct lending business, is a former Goldman executive.)CardWorks is a leading subprime credit card lender that is backed by PIMCO and PE firms Parthenon Capital Partners and Reverence Capital Partners.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)As the Writers Guild of America tries to come to terms with Hollywood studios on a new contract, the union is blasting the Walt Disney Co., Netflix and Amazon as the ""new gatekeepers"" of media in a new antitrust report that accuses the entertainment behemoths of anti-competitive practices.The Thursday report, issued by the WGA's West Coast branch, comes after the guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major studios and streamers, restarted negotiations to end the writers' strike that has been going on for more than 100 days.Despite optimism sparked by the renewal of talks, the sides remain far apart on key issues, including the WGA's demands for minimum staffing requirements on TV writers’ rooms.The union's report argues that Disney, Netflix and Amazon have used their growing size and industry clout to undercut writers. The document details how media and tech companies have consolidated power through mergers and acquisitions, and called on government regulators to put a stop to it.Major acquisitions over the years have included Disney's purchase of 21st Century Fox in 2019 and Amazon's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, which was completed last year. The guild also contends that streamers like Netflix pioneered business models that reduced the pay of writers and were later adopted by other, more traditional companies, including Disney.The WGA report makes the case that vertical integration, which is when studios make content for their own distribution platforms, has hurt writers and will get only worse if it continues.""Each [company] is now taking anti-competitive vertical integration to an extreme, turning its streaming service into a walled garden for self-produced content — a model built for and dependent on restricting the availability of independent content from competing producers, underpaying creators, and, above all, making future consolidation the name of the industry game,"" the WGA West said.Story continuesDisney, Netflix and Amazon declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment.Read more: The WGA and AMPTP are talking again. Why the studios were motivated to return to the tableThe WGA has been on strike since May 2, with writers demanding better pay from streaming shows as well as protections from artificial intelligence and other industry shifts. SAG-AFTRA, the union representing actors and other performers, walked off the job in mid-July.Contract talks resumed only recently, after a long pause in bargaining. Though neither the AMPTP nor the WGA has commented on the progress of the talks or the details of their back-and-forth, the antitrust report is a barb against the studios at a sensitive time. It remains unclear how long it might take for a compromise to come to fruition. Few industry observers expect a quick resolution.""I think they would have a more conciliatory tone if they were anywhere close to an agreement,"" said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine University's Graziadio Business School.In its report, the WGA West raised concerns about more consolidation among streaming services in the future. The guild said that if big mergers and acquisitions continue, it will put more pressure on the wages of writers, who have already seen their pay eroded by the smaller number of episodes per season on streaming services.Read more: Writers' strike: What's at stake and how it could disrupt Hollywood""The accumulation of market power enables these companies to undervalue writing services and the writers who supply them,"" the WGA West said. ""Further consolidation will leave writers with only a few potential employers, and these dominant content buyers will have a significantly decreased incentive to innovate.""The guild called on antitrust regulators and lawmakers to block deals and investigate anticompetitive practices and increase regulation of the streaming industry. U.S. regulators recently halted the proposed publishing merger of Simon &amp; Schuster with Penguin Random House. After the setback, Paramount Global agreed to sell Simon &amp; Schuster to private equity firm KKR.Read more: As Hollywood strike looms, five writers share their storiesThere has been increased pressure on studios to resolve the dual Hollywood strikes with film and TV writers and actors, including from investors.This week, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, on behalf of trustees of five New York City pension funds, sent letters to Disney, Comcast and Paramount Global, urging the companies to end the strikes.""The costs of this disruption are great, and are increasing by the day, along with the financial risk to your company’s market valuation,"" Lander wrote in a letter to Disney's chief executive, Bob Iger, on Aug. 14.

So assuming that companies know what they're doing and what they want to do with AI, which is a big assumption-- you know, because what I see is people sort of scrambling and saying, hey, we need to do something. But it's not clear what they want to do.But assuming that they get some clarity around what AI really means for their business, then these numbers are justified, right? Because the value that someone really good can bring to the table is awesome. Now, the trouble is that there's a lot-- there's a high variance in people's abilities and skills to actually translate something into real sort of money, business profits.So it's not easy to get the right person. But if you can get the right person, then yeah, that-- you know, the right person is worth that kind of money. I mean, you can't pay people enough, the right people enough for this thing. There are lots of people out there. But getting the right people, that's the challenge.DIANE KING HALL: And one of the things we're showing right now is a graphic of some of the job opportunities that are out there within AI. And these are on the lower end of the range we're discussing for--VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: --you know, from jobs paying in the $200,000 range to the $400,000 range. So not quite at that Netflix level of $900,000. So what kind of-- and the companies that probably come to mind for you or, say, an NVIDIA, what kind of companies really kind of understand this best versus companies that are like, to your point, we just-- we got to get in on this?VASANT DHAR: Well, the majority fall in the second category, right? So most people are saying, we need to do something, but it isn't clear what they need to do, while you have some companies who are the leaders and AI is their business, right? So Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon. You know, AI is their business. And so they've got the skills. They've got the best talent. And they have no difficulty attracting good talent.But regular companies, yeah, they have a hard time attracting that kind of talent. So they're willing to pay up.DIANE KING HALL: And I want to ask you really quickly, the flip of this is-- there was a report out earlier this week about a percentage of companies that have replaced jobs with AI, with the generative AI, you know, kind of the technology versus a person. How effective do you think that can actually be, especially when you also have some issues with regard to AI doing what it says it can do, the problem with making stuff up, the hallucination effect?VASANT DHAR: OK, well, there's the-- there are two sort of-- there were two parts to your question.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.VASANT DHAR: And I've already forgotten the first one because the hallucinations are so--DIANE KING HALL: Let's say-- let's go with hallucination and talk about that piece because there was a report out today about issues like with OpenAI--VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: --you know--VASANT DHAR: Right.DIANE KING HALL: --these models tested for hallucinations.VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: And--VASANT DHAR: Yeah.DIANE KING HALL: --they were given questions. And they got it wrong.VASANT DHAR: Yeah, but we shouldn't be surprised, right? We should not conflate the ability of the computer to speak well with knowledge, right? It's like-- you know, someone just said that it's like an alien species that's descended on Earth. And they speak such good English that we think they know everything. And they don't.Like, we should not be surprised that they get a lot of things wrong just like people do, right? People get all kinds of things wrong. So why should you expect ChatGPT to get everything right? Because it's been trained on everything out there, right? It's learned truths, falsehoods, slurs, everything, right?And these are these sort of-- you know, what are called pre-trained models that have been trained on everything out there. And then you get applications built on top of them like ChatGPT, where you sort of train it to talk in a certain way. But it inherits all of the, you know, sort of limitations of these sort of pre-trained models that it's built on.And that's the thing to keep in mind is that, yeah, these pre-trained models make it easy to build applications really quickly. But they'll inherit the limitations of these models. And, you know, one of the sort of big limitations of this current, sort of, paradigm is that despite the really impressive things that AI is accomplished-- you know, and the most impressive one is the fact that a machine can actually talk to you-- it has huge limitations, right? It-- there are lots of things that it doesn't know. And we don't know the things that it doesn't know.DIANE KING HALL: All right.VASANT DHAR: So it becomes hard to trust it. It's like talking to someone really intelligent, but you don't really know whether you should trust them all the time.DIANE KING HALL: That's right. Well, we will have to put a pin in that and explore the trust question later. Professor Vasant Dhar from NYU Stern, we appreciate you Thank you.]"

This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby poising Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX for growth.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at more than $75 per barrel.Dividend Stocks to Keep an Eye OnThe overall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks to GainMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation.

Retail sales for July were up 0.7% from the previous month, which was well above estimates of 0.4%. This among a number of other economic data points are say one thing quite emphatically, the US economy is very strong. Further confirming this notion, is GDP growth estimates. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta provides a nowcast estimating US annual economic growth and revised the number this week to 5.8%.  Consumers Favor DiscountsHowever, contrary to this data, we saw an interesting trend emerge from the totality of these earnings. Consumers are shifting their buying patterns to make more purchases at discount retailers.While both Target and Home Depot beat earnings estimates, Target missed on sales, and both retailers are expecting slower growth over the next year. Home Depot reiterated its forward guidance after lowering the outlook last quarter and Target guided lower on both sales and revenue forecasts.Target CEO Brian Cornell noted on the earnings call that “As we look at the consumer landscape today, we recognize the consumer is still challenged by the levels of inflation that they’re seeing in food and beverage and household essentials…So that’s absorbing a much bigger portion of their budget.”On the flip side, both Walmart and The TJX Companies raised forward guidance and beat sales and earnings estimates.Not too surprisingly, Walmart and The TJX Companies enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, while Target and Home Depot have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide with 4,865 stores. The company’s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. Additionally, TJX attracts consumers through rapid turn of inventories, which makes for an always fresh range of discounted products.Story continuesOn Wednesday, TJX reported Q2 earnings. EPS came in at $0.85, a 23% YoY increase and well above estimates of $0.77. Sales $12.76 billion also beat estimates of $12.45 billion and showed a 7.7% YoY gain.TJX has begun to see analysts revise earnings estimates higher, with both FY23 and FY24 earnings being upgraded by 1% over the last month. Both sales and earnings are projected to grow at a very nice pace over the next two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of TJX blasted to all-time highs following the stellar earnings report and are now up 13.2% YTD. The TJX Companies stock has compounded at an annual rate of 14% over the last ten years, outperforming the broad market.TJX is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25x, which is below the industry average of 27x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x. Additionally, the company offers a dividend yield of 1.5% and has raised the payment by an average of 9.7% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWalmartSurprisingly, Walmart shares are selling off following its exceptional earnings report. Nonetheless, the stock looks very appealing at the current levels, and new business verticals at the retail giant look to be paying off.WMT has been gaining momentum in two of its high margin revenue streams; advertisements and its membership program Walmart+. Walmart has added in-store ads in the aisles, on the checkout screens, and played over the stores radio, and has recruited its most engaged customers to its membership program. These developments have been critical in raising earnings expectations. The advertisement business grew a reported 36% YoY.Walmart also saw momentum in its e-commerce business. Online sales jumped 24% YoY.Analysts have taken notice and began raising earnings estimates over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been raised by 1.2%, and FY23 estimates by 0.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25.5x, which is above the industry average of 23.2x, and above its five-year median of 23.4x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 1.4% and has raised it by an average of 1.9% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTarget After trading immediately lower following the earnings report, Target stock has recovered and rallied ~5% off its 2023 lows. And while investors may want to wait for analysts to begin revising their earnings estimates higher, raising its Zacks Rank, TGT is now trading at a fairly compelling valuation.Target is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is well below the industry average of 27x, and below its five-year median of 18.3x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 3.4% and has raised the payment by an average of 13% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdmittedly, earnings estimates have been revised lower almost unanimously by analysts. Current quarter earnings estimates have been downgraded by -7.4% and FY23 earnings estimates by -4.5%.However, another point on the bullish side is that EPS are projected to grow nicely in the coming quarters. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 23% YoY to $1.89 and FY23 EPS are forecast to grow 31% YoY to $7.88. This follows management’s effort to build back profitability at the retailer.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTarget shares are now -50% off their all-time high. The stock has compounded at an annual rate of 8.1% over the last 20 years, underperforming the broad market.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewHome DepotHome Depot has compounded at an incredible 15% annually over the last 20 years, far outperforming the broad market. HD also offers a dividend yield of 2.5% and has raised it by an average of 14.5% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, as fantastic as the stock has been over the years, the near future may be a bit rocky. While HD reported EPS of $4.65 beating estimates of $4.45 it showed a YoY decline from $5.05. Sales also beat estimates and showed a slight decline YoY.The earnings revision trend has been mixed, giving HD a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but forecasts are weak over the next year. Sales and earnings are expected to fall through the year end. Although there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sales and earnings growth are expected to resume in FY24.While HD management still believes their core customers are in a healthy place economically, the reality is that Covid pulled forward a lot of DIY home improvement sales. With people stuck at home during the pandemic, many homeowners opted to do work on their homes, and are not yet at the point where they need to do more.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHome Depot is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.3x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and just above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe US economy is in an interesting position, and this week’s retail earnings provided some useful information.

Here to discuss we have Bernstein Senior Analyst Aneesha Sherman. Aneesha, thanks so much for joining us. So when you think about these retailers who have reported-- we have Walmart, The Target, we had TJX, what stands out to you as the trends that we are seeing this time around?ANEESHA SHERMAN: It is a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter, which is that, on top of 2022 super strong consumer demand, the consumer this year has been much more cautious, looking for deals, looking to trade down, looking to buy lower priced items within category, and to buy smaller baskets. And we're seeing that trend impact Walmart. Walmart is leaning into it and pricing better.Story continuesWe're seeing it in TJX, where TJX had average baskets slightly down, average ticket slightly down, but got the comp out of traffic because people are switching out of department stores and shopping at a Marmaxx-- a Marshalls, or TJ Maxx to get better value. So it is definitely the value-seeking behavior that has been consistently the trend across this week's retail results, and I expect that to continue with Ross tonight.- Yeah, Aneesha, when you take a look at Walmart's numbers here, just foot traffic up 2.8%. They also posted a higher ticket up 3.4% online sales, also on the rise for the quarter. When you talk about this trend, it's a continuation of what we've seen since the start of the year. Is this a trend that you see sticking through the end of the year?ANEESHA SHERMAN: I think so, yeah. I mean, Last year the lower income consumer was more pressured, but this year we've seen the cumulative effects of inflation and high rates impact not just low income, but middle income and slightly more premium consumers as well. So we're not just seeing it at those low tiers, we're seeing it across the economy, and we're seeing it across segments of retail as well, from discount all the way up to premium and accessible luxury. So I do expect it to continue for a little while longer.- And so Aneesha, when do you think this pattern breaks out? Because I remember seeing a cycle like this before. The last time around where I saw this trade down when you were thinking of even the higher income shopper going to-- switching and converting to TJ Maxx, The Marmaxx brands, was the Great Recession. I don't know if you're old enough to have been around then covering it. (LAUGHING) But want to ask is, do we see any kind of trend shifting away from that before the year is out, especially when you consider this back half of the year? It's such a crucial time for retailers.ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah. So the dynamics during the GFC were that, it was the big trade down event that actually really helped TJX and Ross. 2009 was one of the best years for TJX and Ross because we saw a huge amount of trade down. The big difference is, that was a sharp shock. Huge amount of consumers lost their jobs. They had to immediately shift their spending habits, and we had some really negative comps across retail.This time around it's been more slow. Unemployment still remains really low. People still have jobs. But it's inflation that's creeping up. And so the trade down has been more gradual. We've seen it happen over-- this is a third quarter now where we've seen traffic at these discount retailers up and traffic at the mainstream retailers down. And so that share shift is happening more slowly. It's not ripping off a Band-Aid. It's going to be a slow burn for the next couple of quarters.- So Aneesha, let's talk about the other end of the spectrum when we take a look at the luxury consumer. Tapestry was out with its results. Disappointing year. US demand clearly waning a bit, at least when you take a look at these numbers. Before we talk about their acquisition last week, what can you-- is this a start of a trend just in terms of weakness that we're seeing in luxury here in the US? And is that maybe indicative of what we could see overseas?ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah. These companies, these accessible luxury companies, as well as high luxury companies had a phenomenal year last year. They had limited supply. The consumer was out and about for the first time post COVID, and was eager to buy accessories, and ready-to-wear, and shoes for going back to weddings, and going on trips, and going back to work, and so on. So we had this huge wave of pent-up demand.And Tapestry's North America number was 26% growth last year, and this year it's about flat. So part of it is just lapping a very strong year. But beyond that, it's also indicative of this broader trend that we've been talking about. The consumer is getting more value-seeking, not interested in buying as many discretionary items, and is looking to do some trade down. So we've seen some of this flagging consumer demand across the luxury sector as well as further down the premium as well as mainstream retail.- Aneesha, I got to ask you, what do you make of that deal of Tapestry and Capri, especially when you think about that point about the direction that you've seen some of Tapestry brands go. I've seen more coach bags than I could remember in-- I never used to see them in TJ Maxx. I've seen a bunch of them now. And when you think about them purchasing-- I mean, we've seen cause in decline. Does this even make sense from your point of view?ANEESHA SHERMAN: Short-term, it deteriorates the quality of the Tapestry portfolio because the company they're buying is a slower growth, lower margin company. They're levering up to do it so it deteriorates their balance sheet. They're pausing their buybacks so it takes a few off their earnings growth for the next couple of years. So on all metrics, it's a lower quality company now and is valued it should be valued at a lower multiple.However, long-term rationale makes sense, which is basically that, they are trying to gain scale in the luxury market. To run a direct to consumer luxury brand, you need a lot of scale. You need to invest in brand building, and marketing, and real estate, and flagship stores, and events, and you can do that much better when you have better firepower in terms of higher cash flows, higher marketing budget, and that's a lot easier to do when you are a $12 to $15 billion brand than when you're a 6 to $7 billion brand. So that is the long term rationale, which I think makes sense. But short-term, it does deteriorate the quality of the company.- Aneesha, do you see Tapestry after acquiring Capri-- is it going to be a real competitor to some of the larger players, the leaders in this space when you take a look at LVMH and also Kering? I don't think we're going to see it replace LVMH or Kering any time soon. However, I think it will start to access the lower end of that demand. So accessible luxury band within a Kering, or within some of these other high luxury brands, is what they're looking for.They're not looking to be the next Chanel. I don't think that's feasible. I think they're looking to take a step up. And in order to do that, they need to attract a different consumer, a higher end consumer, and they need this kind of marketing brand building ability to do that, and they need the scale for that to work. So it does make sense. I don't think it's going to end up being a high luxury brand any time soon, but I think it's going to take a step up from where it is now.- Well, we're certainly seeing them build the scale. We'll see if they build up the luxury cachet that they're trying to go for. Aneesha Sherman, thank you so much.]"

It also opened nine new stores in its international business in the quarter, which is likely to have reflected in the second quarter results.However, over time, escalating costs and operating expenses have been a concern for Bath &amp; Body Works. BBWI’s cost of sales and general, administrative and store operating expenses increased by 2.4% and 6.7% year over year, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. Though pricing actions are expected to have been a relief, higher prices of raw materials and logistics, along with the ongoing headwinds from growth investments, might have adversely impacted its performance. BBWI estimates net non-operating expenses of $75 million in the to-be-reported quarter.For the second quarter, Bath &amp; Body Works expects its gross margin to be roughly 39%, reflecting a year-over-year decline from 40.8%. The decrease is primarily attributable to the expected sales decline and increased occupancy expenses from new store growth. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the band of 27-32 cents compared with 52 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Bath &amp; Body Works this time around.

And now I'll turn it back over to Ernie.Ernie Herrman : Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John Klinger. I'd like to begin today by once again recognizing our global associates for their dedication to TJX. It is their hard work that brings our business to life every day for our customers. I want to extend a special thank you to our store, distribution and fulfillment center associates for their continued very hard work and commitment to our company. I want to comment on the wildfires in Maui. We are grateful that our associates in Maui and the rest of Hawaii are safe. And at the same time, are deeply saddened by the devastation and loss. To help with the relief efforts on the ground, we have made a donation to the Maui Food Bank and our local teams are donating essential supplies.Story continuesNow to our business update and second quarter results. I am extremely pleased with our second quarter performance as sales, profitability and earnings per share were all well above our plans. I want to highlight that customer traffic drove our 6% overall comp sales increase, and it increased at all of our divisions. As a reminder, for us, customer traffic represents the number of customer transactions. I am particularly pleased with the performance of our largest division, Marmaxx, which delivered high single-digit increases in both comp sales and customer traffic. Our overall apparel and accessories sales were very strong. And our overall home sales significantly improved and returned to positive comp sales growth. Clearly, our terrific mix of branded, fashionable merchandise and great values resonated with shoppers when they visited our stores.In terms of profitability, both pre-tax profit margin and earnings per share increased significantly versus last year. Importantly, merchandise margin continues to be very healthy with our above-plan sales and profitability performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year outlook for comp sales, pre-tax profit margin and earnings per share. John will talk to this in a moment. We are very pleased with the continued momentum of our business and the excellent execution of our teams across the company. They have been laser-focused on driving sales and traffic and improving profitability. The third quarter is off to a very strong start, and we feel great about our plans for the remainder of the year. The marketplace is loaded with outstanding buying opportunities and we are confident that we will continue to offer a terrific mix of brands and an outstanding assortment of gifts to our shoppers during the fall and holiday selling seasons.We are convinced that our differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values will continue to serve us well and allow us to capture additional market share across our geographies for many years to come. Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our second quarter financial results in more detail.Apparel, ClothesPhoto by Ian Deng Quddu on UnsplashJohn Klinger : Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. I'll start with some additional details on the second quarter. As Ernie mentioned, our overall comp store sales well above the high end of our plan and were entirely driven by an increase in customer traffic. We were very pleased to see that both comp store sales growth and customer traffic improved sequentially each month of the quarter. As we expected, average ticket was down due to merchandise mix, the impact of the lower ticket on sales was largely offset by an increase in units with shoppers putting more items into their cart. This is in line with what we have seen in our business historically.Our overall apparel business, including accessories, continued its momentum with high single-digit comp increase. Overall, home comp sales were up mid-single digits. TJX net sales grew to $12.8 billion, an 8% increase versus the second quarter of fiscal '23. Second quarter consolidated pre-tax margin of 10.4% was up 120 basis points versus last year. This was well above our plan due to a bigger benefit than we expected from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on our above-plan sales. Gross margin was up 260 basis points. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin due to the significant benefit from lower freight costs. This year-over-year freight benefit was primarily driven by lower rates as well as a benefit from our freight initiatives and the remainder of our year -- in the remainder of our year-end accrual adjustment.Gross margin also benefited from our inventory and fuel hedges, and expense leverage on a 6% comp increase. Our year-over-year shrink accrual and supply chain investments were headwinds to gross margin in the second quarter. Second quarter SG&amp;A increased 170 basis points due to a combination of factors. These include higher incentive accruals and due to above planned results, a reserve related to a German government COVID program receivable, incremental store wage and payroll costs and a contribution to The TJX Foundation. Net interest income benefited pre-tax profit margin by 40 basis points versus last year. Lastly, we were very pleased that earnings per share of $0.85 were up 23% versus last year and also well above our expectations. Now moving to our second quarter divisional performance.At Marmaxx, second quarter comp store sales increased an outstanding 8%, entirely driven by customer traffic. Marmaxx's apparel and home categories both saw high single-digit comp increases. Further, it was great to see comp sales and traffic increases accelerate every month throughout the quarter. Comp sales were very strong across each of Marmaxx's region. We also saw consistent performance across low, mid- and high-income store demographics. Marmaxx's second quarter segment profit margin was 13.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by a benefit from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on the strong sales and strong mark on. We continue to be pleased with the momentum at Marmaxx and are excited about the initiatives we have planned to help us drive sales and traffic for the remainder of the year and beyond.At HomeGoods, we were very pleased to see second quarter comp store sales increased 4% and a significant increase in our end customer traffic. HomeGoods comp sales and traffic increases also accelerated every month throughout the quarter. I also want to note that our full year plans assume that HomeGoods will continue to comp positively for the second half of the year. HomeGoods second quarter segment profit margin was 8.7%, up 600 basis points and entirely due to benefit -- a benefit from lower freight costs. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities we see to grow both our HomeGoods and HomeSense banners and capture additional share of the U.S. home market. At Canada, comp store sales were up 1% and customer traffic increased. Segment profit margin was 15%.As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Canada, we have a very loyal shopper base in many value-conscious shop customers. We are confident that we are set up well to continue growing our footprint across Canada and attract more customers to our banners. At TJX International, comp store sales increased 3% and customer traffic was also up. It was great to see comp sales and traffic increases at both our European and Australian businesses. During the quarter, we also launched online shopping in Germany and Austria. Segment profit margin for TJX International on a constant currency basis was 2.1%, which was negatively impacted by over 300 basis points due to the reserve related to the German receivable I spoke to earlier. We are very happy with our overall performance in this division and are confident we can continue to grow our banners in our existing countries and improve profitability.As to e-commerce, overall, it remains a very small percentage of our business. We continue to add new merchandise to our sites so that shoppers can see something new every time they visit. Moving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was down 7% versus the second quarter of fiscal '23. Similar to the first quarter, the year-over-year decline was primarily due to the elevated levels we saw last year from the early arrival of merchandise and a larger in-transit balance as a result of supply chain delays at that time. We feel great about inventory levels in the outstanding buying environment. As Ernie said, the marketplace is loaded with merchandise, and we are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this fall and holiday season.I'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash. In the second quarter, we paid down $500 million of maturing debt and returned $932 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. Now I'll turn it back to Ernie.Ernie Herrman : Thanks, John. I will start by highlighting the key strengths that have allowed TJX to grow successfully through many kinds of retail and economic cycles for nearly five decades. I'm convinced that these core strengths set us apart from many other retailers and will continue to be a tremendous advantage going forward. First is our value leadership. Our goal has always been to offer great value on every item, every day to every customer. At TJX, value is more than just offering consumers a great price. For us, value also means delivering desirable brands, fashionable merchandise and great quality to our shoppers. We believe our value proposition is one of the best in all of retail, and will continue to attract consumers to our retail banners all around the world.Second, we have developed one of the most flexible brick-and-mortar retail models in the world. The flexibility of our close to need opportunistic buying allows our merchants to quickly react to the hottest trends in the marketplace and adapt to changing consumer preferences. The flexibility of our supply chain and store formats allows us to ship to our stores multiple times a week, merchandise stores individually and flex our floor space to support our ever-changing assortment. Third, we successfully operate stores across a wide customer demographic. We want to sell to everyone, and we aim to appeal to all value-conscious shoppers and inspire and excite them every time they visit us. The flexibility of our business allows us to curate an assortment of good, better and best merchandise across our stores, and to appeal to shoppers across all income demographic areas.Next, we have built an expansive vendor universe over many decades and believe we have some of the best relationships in all of retail. This vast network of changing vendors, which numbered approximately 21,000 over the last year, is the reason why we are so confident that there will always be more than enough inventory in the marketplace for us to buy. Our best-in-class buying organization of 1,200-plus merchants does a terrific job selecting the right mix of categories and brands for the right stores to create our fun treasure hunt shopping experience. We also see the globalness of our business as a tremendous strength. We have built a highly integrated global infrastructure, supply chain and buying organization that we believe would be difficult to replicate.This allows us to leverage our global presence to create a differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience in each country we operate in. Last, but certainly not least, is our talent. Teaching and talent development have always been priorities at TJX. Through our organization and management teams, we have deep decades-long off-price experience in the U.S. and internationally. I believe that our global talent base will continue to be a tremendous advantage as we continue our growth around the world. I truly believe that the combination of these key strengths and the execution of them, is why we are one of the strongest companies in all of retail and have a very long history of successful performance. Now I'll briefly highlight the opportunities we see to keep driving sales and traffic in the second half of the year.First, as I said earlier, we are seeing phenomenal product availability across all categories and a wide range of brands. This gives us great confidence that we can bring consumers the right assortment at the right values throughout the fall and holiday season. Second, we feel great about our store merchandising initiatives that we have planned. We are particularly excited about our gifting initiatives as we continue to focus on being a destination for gifts throughout the year. With our rapidly changing assortment, we believe shoppers will be inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new. And third, we have very strong marketing campaigns planned. Each of our brands will continue to reinforce our value leadership position through a combination of channels, including digital, television and social media.We believe our compelling campaigns will capture the attention of new consumers while keeping us top of mind with our existing customers. Moving to profitability. We are extremely pleased that the high end of our adjusted pre-tax profit margin plan for fiscal 2024 now exceeds our previously announced target of 10.6% for fiscal 2025. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the entire organization. I want to assure you that we did not be -- that we will not be complacent and we'll strive to continue improving our profitability over the long term. Before I close, I'd also like to reinforce our deep commitment to acting as a responsible corporate citizen, and I am proud of the work our teams across the globe continue to do. We expect to publish our annual global corporate responsibility report this fall.And I hope you'll take some time to look at our website to learn more about what we are doing. Summing up, we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing across the business and the very strong start to the third quarter. We've had excellent performance in the first half of the year, and our teams have put us in a great position for continued success for the remainder of the year. I'm convinced that the characteristics of our flexible off-price business model and the operating expertise within our organization are unmatched. I am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and a key component of our success. I am extremely confident about the future of TJX and I'm excited about the opportunities we see to capture additional market share and improve profitability in the long term.Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and third quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.John Klinger : Thanks, again, Ernie. Before I start, I want to remind you that fiscal '24 calendar includes a 53rd week. Also, as we stated in our press release this morning, we have offered eligible former TJX associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout offer, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '24 EPS by approximately $0.01 to $0.02, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors. To be clear, any of the guidance we are providing today does not include the potential impact of this pension payout offer. We expect to exclude the impact of this potential settlement charge from our adjusted pre-tax profit margin and EPS results in the third quarter.Now to our full year guidance. We are now planning an overall comp store sales increase of 3% to 4%. As a reminder, our comp guidance excludes our expected sales from the 53rd week. For the full year, we now expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $800 million of additional revenue expected from the 53rd week. As Ernie said, we're increasing our full year profitability guidance. We're now planning full year pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.8%, excluding an expected benefit of approximately 10 basis points from the 53rd week, we now expect adjusted pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.7%. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 90 basis points to 100 basis points versus fiscal '23's adjusted pre-tax profit margin of 9.7%.Regarding shrink, we continue to be laser-focused on our in-store initiatives while making sure we maintain an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers. At this time, our shrink indicators are leading us to believe that we can continue to plan shrink flat in fiscal '24. As a reminder, we will not know the full effect of our shrink initiatives or the accuracy of our indicators until we do a full annual inventory count at the end of the year. Moving on, we're planning full year adjusted gross margin on a 52-week basis in the range of 29.4% to 29.5%, a 180 basis points to 190 basis point increase versus last year. We expect virtually all of this increase to be driven by a benefit from lower freight costs. We are also planning a benefit from merchandise margin.This guidance also assumes a continuation of headwinds from our supply chain investments and incremental distribution center wages. We are very pleased with the level of freight recapture we are seeing given the significant pressure we saw over the prior three years. Our expected freight benefit this year includes a pull forward of most of the benefit we were expecting in fiscal '25. We remain laser-focused and looking at ways to reduce our freight costs. Moving on, we're expecting full year SG&amp;A on a 52-week basis to be approximately 19.1%, a 120 basis point increase versus last year. This expected increase is primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26%, net interest income on a 52-week basis of about $157 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.16 billion shares.As a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.66 to $3.72. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 10 -- excuse me, 14% to 16% versus fiscal '23's adjusted earnings per share of $3.11. Lastly, we now expect to open about 125 net new stores in fiscal 2024, an increase of approximately 3%. This reflects a shift of some of our planned fall openings into next year. Moving to the third quarter. We're planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 3% to 4%. Similar to the second quarter, we expect the comp increase to be driven by customer traffic.We're planning for average ticket to be down less than it was in the second quarter, again, due to merchandise mix. We're also expecting an increase in units sold. We expect third quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $12.9 billion to $13.1 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over the prior year. We're planning third quarter pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5%. We're expecting third quarter gross margin in the range of 30.3% to 30.5%, up 120 basis points to 140 basis points versus last year. We're planning a significant benefit from lower freight costs partially offset by headwinds from supply chain investments, inventory cap and our year-over-year shrink accrual. We're planning third quarter SG&amp;A of approximately 19.3%, up 130 basis points versus last year.This expected increase is driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a third quarter tax rate of 25.3% and net interest income of about $40 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.15 billion shares. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.98, up 10% to 14% versus last year's adjusted $0.86. For the fourth quarter, on a 13-week basis, we're planning comp store sales to be up 3% to 4%, adjusted pre-tax margin in the range of 10.3% to 10.5% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.03. We will provide more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter on our third quarter earnings call. Before I close, I want to echo Ernie's comments that we continue to see opportunities to further improve profitability over the long term.As always, the best way for us to drive profitability is with outsized sales. We continue to see opportunities to grow sales and traffic and capture additional market share. Further, we remain laser-focused on being even better on buying and retailing the goods and driving merchandise margin. At the same time, we expect to continue to face headwinds from incremental wage costs and supply chain investments. As usual, we'll give you a detailed annual guidance beyond this year on our February -- on our call in February. In closing, I want to reiterate that we are very pleased with our -- with the execution of our teams across the company and are confident in our sales and profitability plans. Further, we have a strong balance sheet and are in an excellent financial position to simultaneously invest in the growth of our business and return significant cash to our shareholders.Now we are happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we are going to ask that you please limit your questions to one per person, so we can keep the call on schedule and answer as many questions as we can. Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.See also 12 Largest Barite Producing Countries in the World and 50 Richest Cities in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

OLLI has defied market challenges, showcasing its resilience and growth potential. The company, based in Harrisburg, PA, has seen its stock rallying 58.3% year to date, in stark contrast to the industry's 15% decline.The cornerstone of Ollie's success lies in its 'buy cheap, sell cheap' business model, coupled with prudent cost management and a focus on optimizing store efficiency. The expansion of its customer loyalty program, Ollie's Army, further bolsters its competitive edge.Ollie's Bargain is poised for remarkable growth, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate projecting a robust 12.7% increase in current fiscal-year sales and an impressive 61.7% surge in earnings compared to the previous year. These figures underscore the company's inherent potential and optimistic outlook.Capturing Market OpportunitiesOllie's Bargain’s focus on value-driven merchandise assortments positioned it well to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace and effectively meet consumer demand. The continued success of Ollie's Army has played a vital role in driving sales. With a consistently growing membership, Ollie's Bargain ended the first quarter with more than 13.3 million active Ollie's Army members, which accounted for slightly more than 80% of sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company's performance has been bolstered by the favorable response to its deals and product offerings, which resonate with a wide customer base. Ollie's Bargain's ability to offer appealing and diverse products has been a key driver of its success. Additionally, the company's strong vendor relationships have played a crucial role in further cementing its position in the market.Markedly, Ollie's Bargain's results depend on the availability of the brand name and closeout merchandise at compelling prices. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented about 65%, and non-closeout goods and private-label products collectively accounted for roughly 35% of fiscal 2022 merchandise purchases.Undoubtedly, Ollie's Bargain remains committed to offering better deals, improving operating margins and increasing the store count. The company should benefit from a favorable closeout environment and trade-down activity.Story continuesExpansion StrategyOllie's Bargain is focused on expanding its store footprint as part of its growth strategy. The company aims to achieve a long-term goal of operating more than 1,050 stores, with a target of opening 50 to 55 stores annually.

In addition to new store openings, Ollie's Bargain is committed to remodeling existing stores, with plans to remodel 30 to 40 stores.

We believe that improved closeout opportunities, increased trade down from consumers and significant room for increasing the store count should support this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Management envisions fiscal 2023 net sales between $2.052 billion and $2.067 billion, suggesting an increase from $1.827 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Ollie’s Bargain anticipates comparable store sales to rise in the band of 2-2.8% against the comparable store sales decline of 3% reported last fiscal year.

Driven by its strategic operational endeavors, including a customer-centric business approach, a strong emphasis on its membership program and a commitment to delivering value-oriented offerings, the company's stock has surged ahead of the Zacks Retail-Discount industry.Being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. Year to date, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied about 22.5%, significantly outpacing the industry's modest growth of 5.6%.A Dominant Warehouse RetailerThis Issaquah, WA-based company continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. Low-to-middle-income consumers have preferred discount stores over conventional retailers to meet their day-to-day needs. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding Costco in registering decent sales numbers.Costco’s net sales increased 4.5% to $17.60 billion for the retail month of July — the four-week period ended Jul 30, 2023 — from $16.85 billion last year. Comparable sales for the retail month under discussion increased 2.5%. Costco attained net sales growth of 1.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Traffic or shopping frequency rose 4.8% globally and 3.5% in the United States.No wonder, the company’s total paid members have been rising. Its growing customer base and high renewal rates have been fueling sales. Membership fees increased 6.1% to $1,044 million in the third quarter. The company ended the quarter with 69.1 million paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarket PenetrationThrough a calculated approach that involves identifying untapped markets and tailoring offerings to meet customer preferences, Costco has managed to deepen its roots. This retail bellwether has been steadily expanding its footprint through new club openings in the domestic and international markets. Costco also operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.As of Aug 2, 2023, Costco operates 858 warehouses, including 590 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 32 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 18 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, four each in China and Spain, two in France and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.Costco also remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets. After opening 13, 20 and 23 net new warehouses in fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, Costco plans to open 23 net new units in fiscal 2023. We foresee an improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up.Story continuesWrapping UpA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and a strong liquidity position should help Costco continue outperforming. The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped Costco draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 9.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.3 Picks You Can't Miss Out OnHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Grocery Outlet GO, The TJX Companies TJX and Celsius Holdings CELH.Grocery Outlet, the extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

108,e711f952-47e4-36b4-925d-f8bc3e634f2b,GD,2023-08-18,12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-countries-most-aircraft-carriers-135543612.html,1692280543,STORY,"['LMT', 'HII', 'GD']","[In this article, we look at 12 countries with the most aircraft carriers. You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the naval industry, and head over directly to 5 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers.Aircraft carriers are naval vessels on which planes can land and take off from. The history of aircraft carriers dates back to November 1910 when Eugene Ely, an American pilot, flew a plane from the deck of a US cruiser in Birmingham, Virginia. The same pilot, a couple of months later in January 1911, made a landing on a battleship called Pennsylvania in San Francisco Bay.The British navy also experimented and developed HMS Argus, the first real aircraft carrier for use during World War I. However, hostilities ceased before the carrier could be put in use in the conflict. USS Langley was the first aircraft carrier that joined the US Navy fleet in 1922. However, it was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that truly marked the entrance of aircraft carriers in military conflicts. Nearly eight decades later, the aircraft carrier still remains the most potent and dominant naval platform.Manufacturers after that war ensured that new aircraft carriers that were being built were larger in size and also included armored flight decks. Moreover, heavy weights and high landing speeds of aircrafts created serious problems for the carriers. The British addressed these issues with innovating creations of landing signal systems, angled flight decks, and steam-powered catapults. Over the years, a number of variants of the aircraft carriers have been developed, such as nuclear-power aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, and amphibious assault ships. It is also common today to see multipurpose aircraft carriers.Aircraft Carrier IndustryThe aircraft carrier industry is a multi-billion-dollar market, and according to a report, it is projected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 2% between 2023-2028. Growing territorial and geopolitical disputes in different regions across the world have propelled navies to procure aircraft carriers. Asia-Pacific in particular has become a global flashpoint with risks of military conflicts breaking out every now and then. As a result, it is likely to be the fastest growing region when it comes to procurement of aircraft carriers in the next five years, with countries like China, South Korea and India enhancing their naval arsenal.Story continuesMajor Companies in the IndustryHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is the largest military shipbuilding company in the US. It designs and builds nuclear-powered aircraft carriers for the American Navy. The Gerald R. Ford class, which is considered as the next-generation of aircraft carriers, is also being developed by the Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII). The naval platform will help the United States meet naval operational needs of the 21st century. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) does not only produce and deliver these ships to the US Navy, it also offers service facilities throughout the lifetime of the aircraft carrier. The company generated $10.67 billion in revenues in 2022.General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is another key player in the aircraft carrier industry. This year in April 2023, it entered into a $847 million deal for seven years to repair, maintain and modernize aircraft carriers operated by the United States Navy. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) this year has also started work on constructing two John Lewis class fleet oilers and the ESB 8 expeditionary sea ship for the US Navy. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) has been designing and building ships for the US military since the 1960s.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is known for its aerospace capabilities, but has also lent support to the US military’s naval strength over the years. Its jets have been actively taking part in sea-based tests. In 2014, two F-35C jets made successful landings on the USS Nimitz in San Diego. In 2020, according to a report in Janes, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) entered into a $245.5 million contract to perform sea-trials of the F-35 jet for international customers. The US Navy operates two classes of aircraft carriers – Nimitz and Ford. Both classes are equipped to have up to 75 aircrafts and usually accommodate 40 or more Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35C fighters and Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircrafts.British multinational arms company, BAE Systems plc, was one of the lead members that worked with the UK Ministry of Defense in the delivery of the Queen Elizabeth class of aircraft carriers, which includes HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. These are the largest warships ever constructed in the history of the Royal Navy, and replaced the aging invincible class of carriers.India’s Cochin Shipyard Limited, based in Kochi in the state of Kerala, built India’s first home-made aircraft carrier, the INS Vikrant, for an estimated $3.2 billion. It is also working on building another aircraft carrier named INS Vishal, which is expected to have a displacement of between 65-000-70,000 tonnes. MethodologyWe have ranked countries with most aircraft carriers using data sourced from Global Firepower Index 2023 and Popular Mechanics. Since there are very few countries that possess aircraft carriers, and most of them, with the exception of the United States, have only one or two carriers, we ranked countries based on tonnage in cases where the number of aircraft carriers were the same for two or more countries.If interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Most Powerful Navies in the World.12 Countries With Most Aircraft CarriersPixabay/Public DomainLet’s now head over to the list of countries with most aircraft carriers.12.

The Mineral Nutrition Products segment showed signals of recessionary pressure, with customers seeking to reduce purchases and lower inventory. Across the Performance Products segment, the demand for copper-based products and personal care products declined during the quarter, affecting the segment’s revenues.Higher selling, general and administrative expenses negatively weighed on the company’s operating margin in the quarter under review.Macroeconomic and operational challenges continue to dent the profitability of Phibro. In the fiscal third quarter, supply chain disruptions were less common. In addition, sustained inflation is keeping input cost high, which is reflected in Phibro’s financial results as lower margins and higher inventory carrying values.Phibro Animal Health Corporation PricePhibro Animal Health Corporation PricePhibro Animal Health Corporation price | Phibro Animal Health Corporation QuotePhibro conducts operations globally, including transactions in a variety of currencies. Although a portion of Phibro’s revenues is denominated in various currencies, the selling prices of the majority of its products outside the United States are referenced in U.S. dollars. As a result, Phibro’s revenues are not directly affected by currency movements.Further, Phibro is engaged in highly competitive industries.

The stock has declined 22.6% against the industry’s 3.2% rise.On a positive note, Phibro exited the fiscal third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected revenues. Year-to-date sales growth was strong, driven by Animal Health. It was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth in each of the three major product categories within Animal Health. In particular, vaccine net sales improvement was driven by increased demand and new product launches in Latin America.The development pipeline for Companion Animal continues to progress. Given the strength of Phibro’s current portfolio of products and the anticipated demand for products in the pipeline, the company maintains a bullish approach to its business.Phibro’s existing operations and established sales, marketing and distribution network in over 75 countries provide it ample scope to take advantage of global growth opportunities. Outside the United States, Phibro’s global footprint extends to key high-growth regions (countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate), including Brazil and other countries in South America, the Asia Pacific, China, India, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada, South Africa and other countries in Africa.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc. PEN, Patterson Companies, Inc.  PDCO and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.Penumbra, carrying a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of 43 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 53.6%.

The acquisition of Oak Street Health is expected to advance CVS Health’s care delivery strategy for consumers. However, poor macroeconomic conditions and stiff competition are headwinds.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 29.8% compared with the industry’s 30.4% fall and the S&amp;P 500’s 3.2% rise.The pharmacy innovation company, with integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care, has a market capitalization of $93.23 billion. The company projects a 6.4% growth for the next five years. It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.8%.Riding on current business growth and bullish near-term prospects, the company is worth retaining.Key Growth CatalystsHealth Care Benefit Shows Potential: Following the colossal acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna for an enormous sum of $70 billion, CVS Health introduced its Health Care Benefits business. The segment has been exhibiting continued strong momentum in the past few quarters. In the second quarter of 2023, the company’s registered revenues were up 17.6% year over year. The upside was driven by growth across all product lines. Membership in the second quarter increased by 121 thousand members from prior-year levels. The significant increase in the individual exchange business primarily drove the upside.Health Services Business Gaining Traction: Health Services revenues were up 7.6% in the second quarter of 2023. The upside was primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation and the acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health, partially offset by continued client price improvements.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn May 2023, CVS Health completed its acquisition of Oak Street Health. The buyout will broaden CVS' value-based primary care platform and improve patients’ long-term health through better outcomes and lower costs — particularly for those in underserved communities.Story continuesPharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness on a Growth Track: During the second quarter, the company noted that its considerable expansion in retail pharmacy led to significant market share increases over time. The company’s impressive growth was driven by increased prescription and front store volume, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. Prescriptions filled inched up 1.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the prior year’s levels. The upside was primarily driven by increased utilization.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Despite significant new client wins in the course of a strong selling season, intense competition and tough industry conditions act as major impediments. Major competitors such as Walgreens, Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses. Competition is especially tough in the pharmacy segment as other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments and low-cost pharmacy options become available. Discount retailers, in particular, have made substantial inroads in gaining market share.Poor Macroeconomic Condition: Although prescriptions and related health care service providers like CVS stay out of general macroeconomic turmoil, the recent debt crisis and sluggish economic conditions in the United States could impact consumer purchasing power. This may also influence preferences and spending patterns, resulting in low prescription utilization.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been down 0.3% at $8.62.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $350.9 billion, suggesting an 8.8% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc.

The findings are part of the latest edition of S&amp;P Global's Look Forward Journal, which shines the spotlight on India and its potential over the coming decade as the country contends with multiple overlapping transitions.(PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence)Contributions from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analysts and research leaders focus on demographic dividend, capital markets potential, digital and physical infrastructure, supply chain and geopolitical shocks.""India's path to becoming a more influential global actor will be determined by how effectively it can manage its federalism balancing act and mobilize the participation of grassroots interests,"" said Deepa Kumar, Head of Asia-Pacific Country Risk, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""Mutual support and coordination across cities, states and the central government will be necessary if India is to fulfill its ambition of becoming a global manufacturing hub as well as realizing its goals in energy transition and agriculture.""Key highlights include:India's short-term economic growth will stand on the shoulders of its 678.6 million strong labor force, as estimated by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, but labor market reforms could help to unlock sustainable long-term growth. Skill development will help shift India's economic focus to manufacturing. The lower skill level in Indian manufacturing means that each employee added just $8,076 of value on average in 2021, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. That's far behind the $18,308 achieved in Thailand and the $34,402 seen in Malaysia.India's realized — and unrealized — potential over the next decade will be a story about the successes and opportunities of its diverse states. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence estimates Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh will be India's top 5 growing states over the coming decade (nominal by state). Maharashtra GDP is expected to reach USD824.51bn and Tamil Nadu is forecast to reach USD650.34bn – both by 2030.India has an immense opportunity to increase its share of global manufacturing exports, and the government is seeking to raise manufacturing to 25% of GDP from 17.7% by 2025. India's policy interventions in the smartphone sector illustrate its ambitions for manufacturing as a conduit to service the domestic market as well as its geopolitical aims. India's export industry for telecom equipment, including smartphones, is rapidly expanding. Exports reached $11.8 billion in the 12 months to March 31, 2023, data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence shows.Higher foreign participation in India's domestic government debt market would increase demand and meaningfully lower the cost of new government debt issuance. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Banking Risk Service forecasts credit expansion growth to average 13% annually from 2023 to 2030 due to fast economic growth and banks strengthening following the recent large-scale bad loan write-off.Although the global technology market decelerated recently, India's startup ecosystem continues to enjoy tailwinds. As a result, the share of global venture capital flowing into Indian startups may roughly double by 2030. India emerged as the fourth-most popular destination for startups in the world in 2022, attracting 4.2% of global venture capital, behind the US (41%), mainland China (18%) and the UK (6%), according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.Story continuesFor more insights from Look Forward India's Moment (Volume 3 | August 2023), please visit: https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/special-editorial/look-forward/look-forward-volume-3-2023.

Goldman Sachs has been hired to advise on the sale, the news agency added.The report comes after Arkansas-based Tyson Foods, which sells meat and processed foods, vowed to slash costs after revenue and profit in its third quarter missed estimates. However, Reuters said that the sources did not explain why Tyson Foods is targeting divesting the Chinese poultry division.Many multinational businesses have been looking to sell or pare back their Chinese assets, a trend that analysts cited Reuters said is due to a weak post-pandemic recovery, fierce domestic competition, and broader geopolitical tensions threatening profits. U.S. agricultural group Cargill and British consumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser (LON:RKT) are among the biggest names to sell off divisions in China since 2021.Tyson Foods' first factory in China was opened in 2001.

Shares have lost about 9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Synchrony due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Synchrony Q2 Earnings Beat on Growing Interest IncomeSynchrony Financial reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. However, the bottom line plunged 17.5% year over year.Net interest income improved 8.4% year over year to $4,120 million, beating the consensus mark by 0.6%.It reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on the back of higher interest earned thanks to a high interest rate environment, expanding average loan receivables and elevated benchmark rates. However, increased expenses and provision for credit losses partially offset the upside.Q2 Results in DetailOther income of Synchrony Financial amounted to $61 million, which dropped 69.2% year over year in the second quarter and missed our estimate by 59.9% due to lower gains. In the year-ago quarter, the company registered a $120 million gain on portfolio sales.Total loan receivables of SYF grew 14.7% year over year to $94.8 billion and surpassed our estimate of $94.1 billion in the quarter under review.Total deposits came in at $75.8 billion, which rose 17.1% year over year. Provision for credit losses jumped 91% year over year to $1,383 million due to increased net charge-offs and a reserve build.The purchase volume of Synchrony Financial advanced 0.1% year over year to $47,276 million in the second quarter. However, the figure lagged our estimate by 6.6%.Interest and fees on loans of $4,812 million improved 19.1% year over year and outpaced our estimate by 5.8% on the back of a growing average loan receivables portfolio and increased benchmark rates, partly offset by divested portfolios in the year-ago period. Net interest margin deteriorated 66 basis points (bps) year over year to 14.94%.Story continuesNew accounts of 5.9 million slipped 1% year over year. Average active accounts increased 1% year over year to 69.5 million in the second quarter.Total other expenses of SYF amounted to $1,169 million, up 7.9% year over year and 3.7% higher than our estimate, due to increased employee costs, professional fees and information processing costs. The efficiency ratio of 35.5% improved 220 bps year over year in the quarter under review.Individual Sales Platforms' UpdateHome &amp; Auto period-end loan receivables climbed 10.5% year over year to $30,926 million on the back of lower payment rates. Purchase volume of $12,853 million decreased 0.3% year over year in the second quarter. Interest and fees on loans grew 15.1% year over year to $1,275 million, beating our estimate of $1,238.8 million on the back of growth in loan receivables and increased benchmark rates.Digital period-end loan receivables of $25,758 million rose 17.9% year over year in the quarter under review, on lower payment rates and higher purchase volume. Purchase volume came in at $13,472 million, up 8.1% year over year on the back of growing average active accounts. Interest and fees on loans climbed 34.4% year over year to $1,422 million, beating our estimate by 9.3%, driven by growth in loan receivables, higher benchmark rates and maturing newer programs.Diversified &amp; Value period-end loan receivables grew 14% year over year to $18,329 million in the second quarter on higher purchase volume and decreased payment rates. Purchase volume of $15,356 million improved 6.7% year over year, attributable to solid out-of-partner spending, impressive retailer performance and penetration growth. Interest and fees on loans advanced 32.1% year over year to $1,091 million, beating our estimate by 8.3% on higher loan receivables and benchmark rates.Health &amp; Wellness period-end loan receivables of $13,327 million rose 21.9% year over year in the quarter under review, on increased promotional purchase volume and reduction in payment rates. Purchase volume climbed 16.6% year over year to $4,015 million, on the back of strong active accounts growth and solid customer engagement. Interest and fees on loans improved 22% year over year to $786 million, which outpaced our estimate of $782.6 million on higher volume and loan receivables.Lifestyle period-end loan receivables advanced 13% year over year to $6,280 million in the second quarter, on growing purchase volume and reduced payment rates. Purchase volume of $1,580 million grew 10.4% year over year, thanks to higher transaction values in Outdoor and Luxury. Interest and fees on loans climbed 19.6% year over year to $232 million, beating our estimate by 6.7% on higher loan receivables and increased benchmark rates.Financial Position (as of Jun 30, 2023)Synchrony Financial exited the second quarter with cash and equivalents of $12,706 million, which increased from $10,294 million at 2022-end.Total assets of $108.7 billion rose from $104.6 billion at 2022-end. Total borrowings advanced to $14,231 million from $14,191 million at the end of last year.Total equity of $13,380 million increased from $12,873 million at the end of 2022.SYF’s balance sheet was consistently strong in the reported quarter, with total liquidity of $19,398 million accounting for 17.9% of its total assets.Return on assets of 2.2% deteriorated 130 bps year over year in the second quarter, while return on equity contracted 700 bps year over year to 17% in the same time frame.Capital DeploymentSynchrony Financial returned capital worth $399 million through share buybacks of $300 million and paid common stock dividends of $99 million in the second quarter. It had a leftover share buyback capacity of $1 billion at the end of June 2023.2023 GuidanceThe company continues to expect loan receivables growth to be greater than 10% for this year. In 2022, loan receivables registered 14.5% year-over-year growth. The company anticipates payment rate moderation to continue but stay above the pre-pandemic levels.Net interest margin is now anticipated to be within 15-15.15%, indicating a deterioration from the 2022 reported figure of 15.63%. The company expects the metric to remain consistent with the first-half levels. It expects interest and fees to grow going ahead.Net charge-offs are now projected to be in the range of 4.75-4.90%, which indicates an increase from the 2022 reported figure of 3.00%. The company expects net charge-offs to keep increasing but not reach pre-pandemic levels before 2024.Management expects quarterly operating expenses of $1,150 million for 2023.Even though the continuous high interest rate environment is helping companies like SYF earn higher interest income, it will likely affect consumers’ spending levels. Losses are expected to build up on cards as well as office real estate.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Synchrony has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Synchrony has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They don’t have to be, but they could be based on a blockchain, the ledger technology that powers Bitcoin and the rest of crypto. A CBDC would simply be a digital version of an existing fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, with the imprimatur of the issuing government.Initial participants in Mastercard’s CBDC Partner Program include Ripple, Fireblocks, and Consensys, the company announced Thursday.The program is designed to encourage conversations among key players in the industry and “to drive innovation and efficiencies,” Mastercard’s head of digital assets and blockchain, Raj Dhamodharan, said in a statement.“We believe in payment choice and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy,” he said. “As we look ahead toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.”Mastercard’s track record of innovating in the digital asset ecosystem, especially the CBDC space, reaches far back.

Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Lockheed due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Lockheed Beats on Q2 Earnings, Ups ’23 Sales View  Lockheed Martin reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $6.73 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.43 by 4.7%. The bottom line also improved 6.5% from the year-ago quarter's figure.The company reported GAAP earnings of $6.63 per share compared with $1.16 in the prior-year period.Operational HighlightsNet sales amounted to $16.69 billion in the reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.86 billion by 5.3%. The top line rose 8.1% from $15.45 billion in the year-ago quarter.BacklogLockheed’s backlog as of Jun 25, 2023, was $158.01 billion compared with $145.09 billion at the end of first-quarter 2023.Our model projected backlog worth $145.84 billion in the second quarter of 2023.The Aeronautics segment accounted for $58.10 billion of this amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $35.95 billion. The Missiles and Fire Control, and the Space Systems segments contributed $34.02 billion and $29.95 billion, respectively.Segmental PerformanceAeronautics: Sales improved 17.3% year over year to $6.88 billion, primarily driven by higher volume of production contracts for F-35 jets as well as higher volume of sustainment contracts for C-130 program. Higher net sales from classified programs also added to this unit’s quarterly sales growth.The segment’s operating profit rose 17% year over year to $718 million. The operating margin, however, contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 10.4%.Story continuesMissiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales inched up 0.4% year over year to $2.76 billion. This was driven by higher net sales from tactical and strike missile programs amid lower sales from integrated air and missile defense programs.The segment’s operating profit decreased 11% year over year to $371 million, while the operating margin contracted 170 bps to 13.5%.Space Systems: Sales increased 12.1% year over year to $3.17 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, national security space programs and commercial civil space programs.The segment’s operating profit improved 15% to $312 million. The operating margin expanded 30 bps to 9.9% in the quarter under review.Rotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues decreased 3% to $3.90 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily due to lower sales from Sikorsky helicopter program on account of lower production volume for Black Hawk helicopters.The segment’s operating profit declined 2% to $454 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin expanded 10 bps to 11.6% in the same time frame.Financial ConditionLockheed’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.67 billion at the end of second-quarter 2023 compared with $2.55 billion at the end of 2022.Cash from operating activities amounted to $2.66 billion during the first six months of 2023 compared with $2.77 billion in the year-ago period.Long-term debt as of Jun 30, 2023, totaled $17.26 billion, up from $15.43 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.2023 GuidanceLockheed has partly raised its financial guidance for 2023. The company now expects revenues of $66.25-$66.75 billion compared with its earlier projection of $65-66 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $65.77 billion, which lies lower than the company’s guided range.LMT now expects earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $27.00-$27.20, up from the prior guidance of $26.60-$26.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s full-year EPS is pinned at $27.06, lower than the mid-point of the company’s guided range.Lockheed, however, still expects to generate free cash flow of $6.2 billion during 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Lockheed has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the naval industry, and head over directly to 5 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers.Aircraft carriers are naval vessels on which planes can land and take off from. The history of aircraft carriers dates back to November 1910 when Eugene Ely, an American pilot, flew a plane from the deck of a US cruiser in Birmingham, Virginia. The same pilot, a couple of months later in January 1911, made a landing on a battleship called Pennsylvania in San Francisco Bay.The British navy also experimented and developed HMS Argus, the first real aircraft carrier for use during World War I. However, hostilities ceased before the carrier could be put in use in the conflict. USS Langley was the first aircraft carrier that joined the US Navy fleet in 1922. However, it was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that truly marked the entrance of aircraft carriers in military conflicts. Nearly eight decades later, the aircraft carrier still remains the most potent and dominant naval platform.Manufacturers after that war ensured that new aircraft carriers that were being built were larger in size and also included armored flight decks. Moreover, heavy weights and high landing speeds of aircrafts created serious problems for the carriers. The British addressed these issues with innovating creations of landing signal systems, angled flight decks, and steam-powered catapults. Over the years, a number of variants of the aircraft carriers have been developed, such as nuclear-power aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, and amphibious assault ships. It is also common today to see multipurpose aircraft carriers.Aircraft Carrier IndustryThe aircraft carrier industry is a multi-billion-dollar market, and according to a report, it is projected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 2% between 2023-2028. Growing territorial and geopolitical disputes in different regions across the world have propelled navies to procure aircraft carriers. Asia-Pacific in particular has become a global flashpoint with risks of military conflicts breaking out every now and then. As a result, it is likely to be the fastest growing region when it comes to procurement of aircraft carriers in the next five years, with countries like China, South Korea and India enhancing their naval arsenal.Story continuesMajor Companies in the IndustryHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is the largest military shipbuilding company in the US. It designs and builds nuclear-powered aircraft carriers for the American Navy. The Gerald R. Ford class, which is considered as the next-generation of aircraft carriers, is also being developed by the Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII). The naval platform will help the United States meet naval operational needs of the 21st century. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) does not only produce and deliver these ships to the US Navy, it also offers service facilities throughout the lifetime of the aircraft carrier. The company generated $10.67 billion in revenues in 2022.General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is another key player in the aircraft carrier industry. This year in April 2023, it entered into a $847 million deal for seven years to repair, maintain and modernize aircraft carriers operated by the United States Navy. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) this year has also started work on constructing two John Lewis class fleet oilers and the ESB 8 expeditionary sea ship for the US Navy. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) has been designing and building ships for the US military since the 1960s.Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is known for its aerospace capabilities, but has also lent support to the US military’s naval strength over the years. Its jets have been actively taking part in sea-based tests. In 2014, two F-35C jets made successful landings on the USS Nimitz in San Diego. In 2020, according to a report in Janes, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) entered into a $245.5 million contract to perform sea-trials of the F-35 jet for international customers. The US Navy operates two classes of aircraft carriers – Nimitz and Ford. Both classes are equipped to have up to 75 aircrafts and usually accommodate 40 or more Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35C fighters and Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircrafts.British multinational arms company, BAE Systems plc, was one of the lead members that worked with the UK Ministry of Defense in the delivery of the Queen Elizabeth class of aircraft carriers, which includes HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. These are the largest warships ever constructed in the history of the Royal Navy, and replaced the aging invincible class of carriers.India’s Cochin Shipyard Limited, based in Kochi in the state of Kerala, built India’s first home-made aircraft carrier, the INS Vikrant, for an estimated $3.2 billion. It is also working on building another aircraft carrier named INS Vishal, which is expected to have a displacement of between 65-000-70,000 tonnes. MethodologyWe have ranked countries with most aircraft carriers using data sourced from Global Firepower Index 2023 and Popular Mechanics. Since there are very few countries that possess aircraft carriers, and most of them, with the exception of the United States, have only one or two carriers, we ranked countries based on tonnage in cases where the number of aircraft carriers were the same for two or more countries.If interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Most Powerful Navies in the World.12 Countries With Most Aircraft CarriersPixabay/Public DomainLet’s now head over to the list of countries with most aircraft carriers.12. ThailandAircraft Carriers: 1HTMS Chakri Naruebet is Thailand's and southeast Asia’s only aircraft carrier. Built in Spain, it was commissioned in 1997 and is the smallest aircraft carrier in the world with a displacement of only 11,486 tons. It has a range of 10,000 nautical miles at 12 knots. The carrier also has accommodation facilities for Thailand’s royal family.11. BrazilAircraft Carriers: 1Atlantico is the current flagship carrier of the Brazilian Navy. It was constructed as HMS Ocean in the United Kingdom, and used by the Royal Navy as a floating helicopter platform for the British Royal Marines. In 2018 it was decommissioned and sold to Brazil, where it was renamed Altantico. This is the only aircraft carrier in South America, and the Brazilian Navy aims to use the ship to operate drones. Atlantico has a tonnage of 21,500. 10. SpainAircraft Carriers: 1Operated by the Spanish Navy, Juan Carlos I, is a multipurpose vessel that can be used as a light aircraft carrier and amphibious assault ship. It was designed for expeditionary operations. Juan Carlos I has aviation facilities required for launching Spain’s Harrier fighter jets. According to the Spanish Ministry of Defense, the aircraft carrier has a range of 9,000 nautical miles at 15 knots. Its displacement is estimated to be 26,000 tonnes.9. TurkeyAircraft Carriers: 1Turkey has one light aircraft carrier called TCG Anadolu which is equipped with aviation facilities including the ability to launch and land aircrafts on. President Erdogan’s government plans to equip Anadolu with Bayraktar TB3 after the US ejected Turkey from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 program for acquiring air-defense missiles from Russia. TCG Anadolu has a displacement of over 27,000 tonnes. Turkey is also working on TCG Trakya, which it claims will be bigger than the TCG Anadolu.8. FranceAircraft Carriers: 1FS Charles de Gaulle is France’s only aircraft carrier. It is a nuclear-powered carrier that became operational in 2001. It is 858 feet long and comes with a displacement of 45,000 tons. It is one of the most capable carriers in the world due to its mix of Rafale fighter jets, E-2 Hawkeye aircrafts, and naval helicopters. Charles de Gaulle was to be one of France's two planned aircraft carriers, but the plans for the second one never materialized. As a result, whenever Charles de Gaulle is in drydock, the country is left without an aircraft carrier. The government has plans to replace Charles de Gaulle in the 2030s with a new carrier named Porte-Avions Nouvelle Génération, which will have a displacement of over 75,000 tonnes.7. RussiaAircraft Carriers: 1Admiral Kuznetsov is Russia’s only aircraft carrier, which was launched in 1985 and commissioned in 1991. The flat-top which displaces 58,000 tons was built at the Nikolayev shipyards in Ukraine during the Cold War. It has a range of 8,500 nautical miles and travels at a speed of 29 knots. The ship is now old and has suffered multiple breakdowns in the sea. According to Popular Mechanics, Admiral Kuznetsov is currently undergoing maintenance and upgrade this year, and will be operational again in late 2023.6. ItalyAircraft Carriers: 2Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour are the two aircraft carriers of the Italian Navy. The first ship, which is named after a popular military general in the 19th century, was commissioned in 1985, and has taken part in NATO’s interventions in Afghanistan and Libya. It is set to be replaced soon by Trieste. The Cavour is the first Italian warship to launch and recover Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighters. Both of these carriers have a combined displacement of over 41,000 tonnes. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers.Suggested Articles:25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023Military Spending by Country in 2023: 20 Largest Defense BudgetsNATO Military Spending by Country: Top 20 CountriesDisclosure: None. 12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 26% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 21% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, WEC Energy Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 1.3% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 5% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on WEC Energy Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of WEC Energy Group, it has a TSR of 46% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in WEC Energy Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 18% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.7%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  WEC Energy Group is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Both studies met their primary endpoint of Aquipta achieving a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days from baseline compared with a placebo over a 12-week treatment period.The FDA has already approved the drug to prevent migraine and is currently being marketed in the United States under the brand name Qulipta.In the year so far, shares of AbbVie have dropped 6.2% against the industry‘s 7.9% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, many CGRP drugs are approved in the European Union for migraine prevention, like Pfizer’s PFE Vydura and Eli Lilly’s LLY Emgality. Pfizer’s Vydura is an oral drug which received EC approval last year for preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults, Eli Lilly’s Emgality is a monoclonal antibody approved for preventive treatment of migraine in adults by the EC in 2018.Aquipta likely holds an edge over the Pfizer and Eli Lilly drugs since it is the currently the only oral drug approved for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. Though Emgality is also approved for similar indication to Aquipta, it is administered via a subcutaneous injection.

135,05968623-49e7-307a-a273-0c50a07667b9,JNJ,2023-08-18,America’s courts weigh in on how firms resolve liability claims,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-courts-weigh-firms-resolve-133327499.html,1692279207,STORY,['JNJ'],"[The long-running legal battle over America’s opioid epidemic was reignited when, on August 10th, the country’s Supreme Court said it would review an earlier settlement secured by Purdue Pharma, a main character in the saga. Back in 2021 a federal judge had approved a bankruptcy plan for Purdue—the maker of OxyContin, a highly addictive painkiller—under which the business was to be restructured as a public-benefit company with all future profits going towards settling claims from victims and funding addiction-treatment programs. Members of the Sackler family, which owns the drugmaker, were to contribute $4.5bn (later increased to $6bn) towards the settlement.At issue is a controversial legal arrangement called a “third-party release”, which shields entities associated with bankrupt companies from liability even if they have not filed for bankruptcy themselves. In Purdue’s case, the Sacklers were granted immunity from any future opioid-related claims, an unsatisfying outcome for those who blame the family for their role in fuelling the opioid crisis.American firms have been turning to bankruptcy courts to resolve product-liability claims since the 1980s, but in recent years have done so in increasingly creative ways. In 2021, faced with thousands of lawsuits alleging that its talcum powder caused cancer, Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J), a pharmaceutical giant, deployed the “Texas two-step”—a legal manoeuvre that shifts a company’s liabilities to a separate entity and then declares that entity bankrupt. J&amp;J established a Texan subsidiary, called LTL Management, assigned more than 40,000 talcum-powder claims to it, then filed it for bankruptcy. Last year Aearo Technologies, a subsidiary of 3M, a Minnesota-based conglomerate, was hit with some 260,000 lawsuits related to allegedly defective earplugs. By declaring its subsidiary bankrupt, 3M was also able to limit its exposure. Both companies deny the allegations against them.Story continuesLawyers for the companies argue that the bankruptcy courts are more efficient than the tort system for both defendants and plaintiffs. It is easy to see the appeal for businesses. Declaring bankruptcy pauses all litigation, prevents the filing of any new lawsuits and brings all claims under one roof, while the third-party release arrangement absolves the parent company of future related liabilities. Some claimants also prefer the speedier resolution promised by bankruptcy courts to the slower and more uncertain payoffs on offer in the tort system.Critics point out that bankruptcy is intended for companies that are genuinely insolvent, not merely burdened with lawsuits. In 2022 J&amp;J generated $95bn in sales, handed out $12bn in dividends, had cash holdings of $25bn—and set aside just $9bn to resolve the talcum-powder claims. 3M is similarly unlikely to be sunk by the lawsuits against it. Jared Ellias of Harvard Law School argues that, by dumping their liabilities into a subsidiary, companies facing mass litigation are asking for the benefits of bankruptcy without truly submitting to the courts. For victims seeking a hearing, as well as compensation, the mechanical nature of bankruptcy proceedings minimises discussions of a company’s wrongdoing, which tort battles do not.Courts are increasingly sceptical of the companies’ arguments. In June a judge in Indiana rejected the bankruptcy filing of 3M’s subsidiary Aearo, noting that the company was using bankruptcy as a “litigation-management tactic”. A month later a New Jersey bankruptcy court quashed LTL’s insolvency plea, pointing to the deep pockets of its parent, J&amp;J. The Supreme Court’s scrutiny of Purdue’s third-party releases may be the most consequential of all. According to Pamela Foohey, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, Purdue “really pushed the envelope” in how it used bankruptcy. If the justices agree and limit the use of third-party releases, corporations may find that bankrupting smaller subsidiaries to fight sprawling lawsuits is no longer the saving grace it once was.To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

LITESPARK-005 is evaluating WELIREG for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that has progressed following PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor and vascular endothelial growth factor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI) therapies. In the trial, WELIREG showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to everolimus, based on a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. A statistically significant improvement in the trial’s key secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) was also demonstrated. A trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), a dual primary endpoint, was observed; however, this result did not reach statistical significance. OS will be tested at a subsequent analysis. The safety profile of WELIREG in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with regulatory authorities.""Patients with advanced RCC face low survival rates, and for those whose cancer progresses following PD-1/L1 and VEGF-TKI therapies, there is a need for new treatment options that can reduce their risk of disease progression or death,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""This is the first Phase 3 trial to show positive results in advanced RCC following these therapies and the first new mechanism to demonstrate potential in advanced RCC in recent years. We look forward to discussing these results with health authorities.""Story continuesWELIREG was the first HIF-2α inhibitor therapy approved in the U.S. and is currently approved in the U.S., Great Britain, Canada and several other countries for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery, based on ORR and duration of response (DOR) data from the Phase 2 LITESPARK-004 trial. Additional applications are currently under regulatory agency review worldwide based on LITESPARK-004.LITESPARK-005 is part of a comprehensive development program for WELIREG comprised of four Phase 3 trials in RCC, including LITESPARK-011 and LITESPARK-012, evaluating WELIREG in the second-line and treatment-naïve advanced disease settings, and LITESPARK-022, evaluating WELIREG in the adjuvant setting.About LITESPARK-005LITESPARK-005 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04195750) evaluating WELIREG compared to everolimus for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC that has progressed after prior treatment with PD-1/L1 and VEGF-TKI therapies, in sequence or in combination. The dual primary endpoints are PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR and safety and tolerability. The trial enrolled 746 patients who were randomized to receive WELIREG (120 mg orally once daily) or everolimus (10 mg orally once daily).About renal cell carcinomaRenal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men than in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. In the U.S., approximately 15% of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage.About WELIREG® (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral useIndication in the U.S.WELIREG (belzutifan) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.Selected Safety Information for WELIREGWarning: Embryo-Fetal ToxicityExposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of WELIREG. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective non-hormonal contraception as WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective.AnemiaWELIREG can cause severe anemia that can require blood transfusion. In Study 004, anemia occurred in 90% of patients and 7% had Grade 3 anemia. Median time to onset of anemia was 31 days (range: 1 day to 8.4 months). In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, anemia occurred in 76% of patients and 28% had Grade 3 anemia.Monitor for anemia before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Closely monitor patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers due to potential increases in exposure that may increase the incidence or severity of anemia.Transfuse patients as clinically indicated. For patients with hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;9g/dL, withhold WELIREG until Hb≥9g/dL, then resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue depending on the severity of anemia. For life-threatening anemia or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until Hb ≥9g/dL, then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue.The use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment of anemia is not recommended in patients treated with WELIREG.HypoxiaWELIREG can cause severe hypoxia that may require discontinuation, supplemental oxygen, or hospitalization. In Study 004, hypoxia occurred in 1.6% of patients. In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, hypoxia occurred in 29% of patients; 16% were Grade 3 hypoxia.Monitor oxygen saturation before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. For decreased oxygen saturation with exercise (e.g., pulse oximeter &lt;88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg), consider withholding WELIREG until pulse oximetry with exercise is greater than 88%, then resume at the same or a reduced dose. For decreased oxygen saturation at rest (e.g., pulse oximeter &lt;88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg) or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until resolved and resume at a reduced dose or discontinue. For life-threatening or recurrent symptomatic hypoxia, permanently discontinue WELIREG. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of hypoxia immediately to a healthcare provider.Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on findings in animals, WELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn Study 004, serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients, including anemia, hypoxia, anaphylaxis reaction, retinal detachment, and central retinal vein occlusion (1 patient each).WELIREG was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 3.3% of patients for dizziness and opioid overdose (1.6% each).Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Those which required dosage interruption in &gt;2% of patients were fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, anemia, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and influenza-like illness.Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequently reported adverse reaction which required dose reduction was fatigue (7%).The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were decreased hemoglobin (93%), anemia (90%), fatigue (64%), increased creatinine (64%), headache (39%), dizziness (38%), increased glucose (34%), and nausea (31%).In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: edema, cough, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.Drug InteractionsCoadministration of WELIREG with inhibitors of UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 increases plasma exposure of belzutifan, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Monitor for anemia and hypoxia and reduce the dosage of WELIREG as recommended.Coadministration of WELIREG with CYP3A4 substrates decreases concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates or lead to therapeutic failures. Avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information. Coadministration of WELIREG with hormonal contraceptives may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding.LactationBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialWELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with WELIREG.Use of WELIREG may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Based on findings in animals, WELIREG may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential and the reversibility of this effect is unknown.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of WELIREG in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

Given this, I think Merck could be a good stock to consider here. When we look at the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), it looks like the sector broadly has bottomed as defensive posturing takes place.This is great for healthcare stocks, but what is the specific appeal with MRK stock?A chart comparing the XLV ETF to the SPY ETF. Source: Charts by TradingViewIf I’m right that a credit event is out there and that recession risks remain elevated, Merck’s approach to strategic acquisitions could result in a flurry of new businesses coming under its umbrella. This in turn has potential to drive long-term accelerated growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhy MRK Stock Stands Out NowMerck’s proactive strategies include savvy acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Prometheus Biosciences for $10.8 billion. This acquisition has bolstered its immunology portfolio and increased its research capabilities. Another notable acquisition is that of Acceleron Pharma, which has boosted Merck’s presence in the expanding cardiovascular disease treatment market.In addition to acquisitions, Merck has also entered several strategic partnerships. These partnerships, such as the joint venture with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), offer long-term potential for individualized cancer treatment and other innovative therapeutic approaches. I expect more such partnerships and acquisitions will be in Merck’s future.When we look at Merck relative to the overall healthcare sector, it’s clear that there has been some weakness as of late, but at the same time, it’s still done well since 2022. It seems possible to me longer term that Merck could outpace many other companies in the group.A chart comparing MRK stock to the broader XLV ETF. Source: Charts by TradingViewI also expect there to be more interest in blue-chip stocks that have a history of solid and consistent dividend growth. When we look at Merck over time, we can clearly see a solid uptrend in dividend payouts.Story continuesA chart showing the MRK dividend payout history.Source: Chart courtesy of YChartsThere are risks of course. These include the risk of pipeline failures, lower-than-expected market share for Keytruda and vaccines, and the potential for unfavorable regulations on drug prices. Additionally, Merck’s significant reliance on Keytruda also presents a risk. Should any adverse side effects associated with Keytruda emerge, the demand for the drug could decrease significantly, impacting the company’s financial performance.The Bottom LineRegardless, I think healthcare is a place to overweight right now, and MRK stock is a great pick from the pack. Merck presents a compelling investment proposition for those seeking long-term value creation and defensive price movement given a low beta historically.Despite the looming macroeconomic challenges I expect in the credit markets in the near to intermediate term, the company’s proactive strategies, consistent dividend payouts, and robust pipeline make it a promising candidate for long-term investment. The recent dip in stock prices may not reflect a lasting downturn but could signify an opportunity for investors to take a position in this healthcare titan.As market volatility continues to rise, I expect healthcare stocks like Merck to outperform, making this a potentially opportune time to invest in MRK stock.On the date of publication, Michael Gayed did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

142,ce07e9e5-6d4d-358f-823a-4c064032e225,WMB,2023-08-18,PACCAR and Ashland have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-ashland-highlighted-zacks-bull-115700280.html,1692273420,STORY,"['ASH', 'PCAR', 'WMB', 'KMI', 'MPLX']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 17, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PACCAR Inc. PCAR as the Bull of the Day and Ashland Inc. ASH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc WMB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:PACCAR Inc. is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and customer support of high-quality premium trucks. In addition, PACCAR also offers finance and leasing services.Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across the board for PACCAR as of late, helping land the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company resides within the Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry, which is currently ranked in the top 21% of all industries thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions. As many know, roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries seeing improved outlooks.Outside of the favorable earnings outlook, let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of PACCAR.Current StandingThe company is forecasted to witness notable growth in its current year, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.54 implying 50% growth paired with a 20% revenue bump. Growth cools in FY24, with earnings and revenue forecasted to retreat by 20% and 9%, respectively.Shares could interest those who prefer income, as PCAR shares currently yield 1.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 13% of the company's earnings. PCAR has displayed a shareholder-friendly nature, carrying a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.PACCAR has been firing on all cylinders as of late, exceeding both consensus revenue and EPS expectations in three consecutive quarters.Just in its latest release on July 25th, the company penciled in a 9% EPS beat and reported revenue 2% ahead of the consensus. Undoubtedly a positive, revenue and net income reflected quarterly records, primarily driven by the company's industry-leading logistics performance.Story continuesPACCAR's revenue has recovered from 2020 lows, with sales now eclipsing pre-pandemic levels.In addition, the company's 29.8% return on equity (ROE) is worthy of a highlight, reflecting a higher efficiency level in generating profits from existing assets relative to peers.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.PACCAR would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:Ashland Inc. is a leading specialty chemicals company serving various consumer and industrial markets, including automotive, construction, architectural coatings, adhesives, energy, food &amp; beverage, and pharmaceutical.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook across the board, pushing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In addition, the company resides in the Zacks Chemical – Specialty industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 22% of all Zacks industries. Let's take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.Current StandingAshland shares have struggled to find their footing in 2023, down roughly 19% and widely underperforming relative to the general market. Recent quarterly results haven't impressed the market, with ASH shares remaining on a downward trajectory.Regarding the most recent quarterly release, ASH fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 12% and reported revenue marginally below expectations. It reflected the company's second consecutive quarter of missing on both the top and bottom lines.Top line growth has remained somewhat stagnant over the last several years.Shares do pay a solid dividend, currently yielding 1.8% annually paired with a payout ratio sitting at 30% of the company's earnings. Dividend growth is there, too, with the payout growing by an annualized 8% over the last five years.The company's growth is slated to taper in its current year, with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting an 18% pullback in earnings on 7.5% lower revenues. Still, growth resumes in FY24, with expectations suggesting 20% higher earnings and a 5% revenue bump.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and recent negative quarterly results paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.Ashland is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Midstream Stocks to Gain Amid Energy Market VolatilityThe initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $80 per barrel.The business model of most energy players, by nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc., MPLX LP and The Williams Companies Inc.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well-poised to gain, and hence, investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is the market leading provider of DNA sequencing technologies. Shares declined 19.4% during the second quarter, due to the proxy battle led by activist investor Carl Icahn, who criticized the Board’s decision to approve the closing of the Grail acquisition without regulatory approval. Icahn nominated three new Board members. After a shareholder vote, one of Icahn’s nominees was elected to the Board to replace the Chair. Shortly after the vote, Francis deSouza announced his resignation as CEO, and Illumina started a search for a permanent CEO. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain shareholders and believe that Illumina’s continuous innovation will enable it to broaden DNA sequencing adoption to areas like oncology, reproductive health, genetic disease, infectious disease, drug discovery and proteomics as well as across geographies around the world. For example, its latest NovaSeq X tool removes the need for a cold storage supply chain, opening the opportunity for geographies where it is not readily available.

A potential multimillion dollar sales boost is also on the table for the winning team's sponsor - Nike, or Adidas.Sports sponsorship is a huge driver of sales for apparel manufacturers.

Corporation VFC has been witnessing a tough operating environment, a dismal wholesale performance and higher promotions. This led to a sluggish year-over-year top and bottom-line performance in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently, VFC has lost 1.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4%.The adjusted loss per share was 15 cents against adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The metric came wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents per share. Revenues of $2,086.3 million fell 8% year over year and remained flat on a two-year basis. At constant-currency (cc), revenues also dipped 8% year over year.The top line was hurt by a dismal wholesale performance, and sluggishness in the Americas and EMEA regions, which was partially offset by growth in the APAC region. Channel-wise, wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 12% and 3% year over year on a reported basis, respectively. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research In the said quarter, the adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 52.8% due to elevated promotional activity and higher product costs. The metric reflected 200 bps of adverse rate impact (including promotions) and 10 bps of adverse foreign currency exchange rates, partly offset by 80 bps of mix benefits.The adjusted operating loss was $7.9 million against an adjusted operating income of $77.5 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. The adjusted operating margin of 0.4% was down 380 bps due to a 130-bps impact of adverse gross margin and 250 bps of deleverage.However, VFC is focused on lowering working capital and optimizing inventories. It has been accelerating its cost-saving efforts, which are likely to generate $225 million annually after the completion of its previously announced actions in fiscal 2024.Also, the North Face and China businesses have been experiencing momentum. The company is also seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, allowing it to capitalize on revenue opportunities.It continues to see growing momentum in the APAC region, with revenue growth of 13% on a reported basis (up 18% at cc). In the aforementioned region, revenues across all channels grew in the double digits, driven by brick-and-mortar traffic growth. Greater China witnessed an acceleration of 31% and benefited from the comparison to the prior-year lockdown impacts.The North Face continues to be the key growth driver in this region, with revenue growth of more than 50% in Greater China on the back of outdoor market tailwinds and recovering domestic travel. Evidently, North Face emerged as the number one international outdoor brand in China.V.F. Corp is benefitting from the acquisition of the privately-owned streetwear brand — Supreme. Its strong follower base in the younger generation bodes well for the company.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds are concerning, management expects better second-half revenue performance than the first half on an improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing year-over-year comparisons. These factors are likely to aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.90 has underperformed the industry’s ratio of 12.44, which raises optimism about the stock. Topping it, a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and G-III Apparel GIII.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. RCL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.4%, on average.

Both studies met their primary endpoint of Aquipta achieving a statistically significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days from baseline compared with a placebo over a 12-week treatment period.The FDA has already approved the drug to prevent migraine and is currently being marketed in the United States under the brand name Qulipta.In the year so far, shares of AbbVie have dropped 6.2% against the industry‘s 7.9% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, many CGRP drugs are approved in the European Union for migraine prevention, like Pfizer’s PFE Vydura and Eli Lilly’s LLY Emgality. Pfizer’s Vydura is an oral drug which received EC approval last year for preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults, Eli Lilly’s Emgality is a monoclonal antibody approved for preventive treatment of migraine in adults by the EC in 2018.Aquipta likely holds an edge over the Pfizer and Eli Lilly drugs since it is the currently the only oral drug approved for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine.

Making the right decisions can yield bountiful rewards, while wrong turns can lead to substantial setbacks. There lie hidden gems for those equipped with the right insight and patience. One such treasure is the world of undervalued biotech stocks. These aren't simply low-priced stocks, but genuine opportunities teeming with potential.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PFE. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?However, when we speak of ""cheap"" stocks, it's crucial to distinguish between a genuine bargain and a sinking investment. The biotech market is marked by its volatility, swayed by regulatory verdicts, clinical trial outcomes and broader market movements. Intelligent investments in this space arent just about snatching up the lowest-priced stock; it's about discerning its intrinsic worth. It's about proactive decision-making, discerning genuine value from the surrounding noise.Methodology for selecting biotech stocksIn curating picks for this list, I took advantage of the GuruFocus All-In-One Screener. Initially, I filtered for biotech stocks, narrowing it further to dividend-paying ones. Dividend payout ratios were assessed to gauge the dividends sustainability. Attention then pivoted to the return on equity an indicator of how well a company leverages shareholder equity to generate profit. Finally, I am interested in undervalued picks for this list, so included only those companies that are not overpriced compared to the market. To achieve this, I selected stocks with a forward price-earnings ratio that falls below most of its peers.So if you're scouting for true biotech bargains, you're right where you should be. The classic investment wisdom tells us to ""buy low, sell high,"" but here, it's all about purchasing with prudence. Let's delve deep into the biotech landscape, spotlighting those stocks that, while overlooked, are bursting with potential.Story continuesOverview of PfizerPfizer Inc. (PFE, Financial) has experienced a decline of about 31% year to date, raising concerns for many investors. Yet, a closer look at its second-quarter results reveals a glimmer of hope. While revenue dropped to $12.73 billion, marking a 54% decrease from the previous year, and net income took a hit, dropping about 77% to $2.33 billion, the company astonishingly exceeded its June earnings per share estimates by an impressive 15%. This could suggest it is adept at navigating challenges.Undervalued Biotech Gems: 2 Stocks Combining Dividends With Healthy ReturnsPfizer's legacy and dividend prowessIn the tumultuous realm of biotech stocks, Pfizer's legacy stands resolute. Beyond the figures, we're talking about the powerhouse behind innovations like Viagra, Lipitor and the groundbreaking Covid-19 vaccine, Comirnaty. As the biopharma sector gears up for its biggest merger and acquisition year since the pandemic, now might be an opportune time for investors to eye biotech bargains. Especially given current events, such as the World Health Organization's focus on the EG.5 strain and potential pharmaceutical industry shifts from drug price negotiation bills, a dependable giant like Pfizer presents a compelling choice.Don't sleep on Pfizer's dividend prowess, either. Although not a Dividend Aristocrat, Pfizer is gearing up to pay its 338th quarterly dividend. Impressively, the company has hiked its dividends for 14 consecutive years. In the Drug Manufacturers sector, its 4.58% dividend yield outshines 90.67% of competitors and is notably higher than the industry median of 1.71%. With a dividend payout ratio of 0.43, there's room for continued growth.Undervalued Biotech Gems: 2 Stocks Combining Dividends With Healthy ReturnsReturn on equity and valuationMoreover, Pfizer distinguishes itself in the Drug Manufacturers sector, boasting an outstanding ROE of 22.58%, which outperforms 92.86% of companies in the industry, showcasing its dedication to delivering substantial shareholder returns.From a valuation standpoint, Pfizer's forward price-earnings ratio is 10.77. This makes it more appealing than about 77.42% of the 124 companies in the Drug Manufacturers sector. This ratio is a crucial metric, signifying market expectations for a company's future earnings growth, further emphasizing Pfizer's competitive edge in valuation.In summary, for those scouting for undervalued biotech stock options, Pfizer deserves a spot on your radar.Overview of Gilead SciencesThe biotech sector is renowned for its volatile nature, with companies regularly experiencing swift value surges followed by sharp downturns. Even Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD, Financial), a giant in biotech, hasn't escaped such fluctuations. The stock is down by almost 9% year to date, possibly hinting at an opportunity for discerning investors. Often, these declines are golden opportunities for astute investors to seize bargains that promise long-term returns.Financial performance and strategic agilityDespite a somewhat turbulent first quarter, which saw a 5% revenue increase to $6.60 billion but a 9% dip in net income, there's a brighter side. The company's net change in cash skyrocketed by an impressive 73% to $768 million. Such liquidity retention could be pivotal for future investments and collaborations. Gilead's recent $800 million deal with Cognizant proves its strategic agility during tough times.Undervalued Biotech Gems: 2 Stocks Combining Dividends With Healthy ReturnsReturn on equity and dividend yieldIn terms of profitability, Gilead Sciences shines with a ROE of 26.19%, showcasing its adeptness at converting shareholder equity into profits. This stellar financial indicator positions the company favorably in the Drug Manufacturers sector. It outpaces about 94.92% of companies in the same industry, emphasizing its prowess in offering value to shareholders and its significance in the pharma world.With a dividend yield of 3.69%, Gilead Sciences emphasizes its dedication to its investors. This yield places it ahead of 82.76% of competitors in the cutthroat Drug Manufacturers industry. Though the current payout ratio is a tad high at 0.68, ample room remains for growth, highlighting Gilead's effective resource allocation for dividends and operational reinvestment.Undervalued Biotech Gems: 2 Stocks Combining Dividends With Healthy ReturnsValuationFinally, lets address the topic of valuation.

We will also discuss the emerging trends in the fintech industry and the recent decline in global funding. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Fastest Growing Fintech Companies In 2023.Recent Trends In Fintech IndustryFintech is simply the use of technology and software in the financial sector. Fintech enables consumers to efficiently deal with their finances while bypassing the hassle of traditional banks. The emergence of the fintech industry bears immense significance as it can revolutionize financial services delivery globally. According to a report by EMR, the global fintech market was valued at $194.1 billion in 2022 and has been estimated to grow to $492.81 billion by 2028 at a compounded annual growth rate of 16.8%.The advancement of information technology globally has expanded the customer base for fintech. The pandemic catalyzed the widespread adoption of fintech. According to a report by BCG, in 2019, fintech received 20% of all global venture capital outlays, and by 2021 it represented 9% of all global financial service valuations. For almost a decade, fintech has received billions of dollars in funding; however, it started plummeting in 2022. Rising inflation and interest rates, growing geopolitical tensions, and supply chain problems have all contributed to this decline in funding. According to a report by CB Insights, global fintech funding dropped 46%, and deals fell 8% year over year from 2021 to 2022. During this time, there was also a drop in the number of fintech unicorns born. Therefore, 2022 was not the best year for fintech companies overall. This decline in global funding has continued in 2023 as well. According to another report by CB Insights, a 48% decline has been recorded in global fintech funding in 2023. Even the most valuable fintech companies in the world were not safe from the impact of this massive decline.Story continues Many fintech companies have shifted their focus towards unit economics to recover from the downturn. The companies aim to emerge stronger on the other side of this slow funding era by strengthening the business's fundamentals, like innovation and recurring customers. On July 19, Reuters reported that fintech companies have started to impose stricter lending standards amid the current funding environment easing their way to debt financing from Wall Street.On August 7, Reuters reported that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) launched a US dollar stablecoin making it the first major fintech company to conduct transactions in a digital currency. Stablecoins have a monetary value dependent on a stable asset which makes them relatively immune to drastic changes in their worth. Stablecoins are used mainly to buy other cryptocurrencies. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) enables users to redeem their stablecoins for US dollars at any given time. As of August 17, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is worth $64 billion on the open market.Regional Insights And Noteworthy CompaniesAccording to the report by BCG, Asia Pacific is on track to be the largest fintech market by 2030 at a projected CAGR of 27%. The APAC region has a massive underbanked population and growing attention toward tech-savvy solutions, making the perfect ingredients for rapid growth. China and India are expected to lead this transition. North America currently is the most dominant in the global fintech market, and the US is estimated to contribute significantly to total global fintech revenue through 2030. Europe also has immense potential and is expected to grow rapidly in terms of fintech. The BCG report estimates that the US and Europe will have a revenue CAGR of 17% and 21%, respectively. Moreover, Latin America and Africa are expected to be the fastest-growing regions in fintech by 2030. These regions have massive underbanked populations and are moving towards digitization, posing a great opportunity for fintech to grow. These numbers indicate that despite the current turbulent landscape the fintech industry has a lot of potential to grow. On June 28, Reuters reported that the payment giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is acquiring a Brazilian fintech startup named Pismo for $1 billion, marking the largest fintech exit in that region since Nubank (NYSE:NU) went public. Pismo will continue with its current management team under Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).  There are many fintech companies growing at a noteworthy rate in 2023. Some of the most prominent companies that have stood strong during this time include Nubank (NYSE:NU), LM Funding America, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMFA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). These companies have managed to not only survive but grow during the current uncertain situation faced by the fintech industry globally. Nubank (NYSE:NU) is one of the most prominent fintech companies in the world. It is a giant in the Latin American fintech market. It has become the fourth-largest financial institution in Brazil. Nubank (NYSE:NU) has been rapidly gaining customers and is growing quickly. The blooming number of customers has contributed greatly to the growth of the company. Nubank (NYSE:NU) is among the most promising fintech stocks to buy. On August 15, the company reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. Nubank (NYSE:NU) reported earnings per share of $0.05 and beat EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.87 billion, up 61.43% year over year, and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $93.34 million.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.Latest PricesTop StoriesBitcoin (BTC) has broken out from its very tight trading range, but not in ways the bulls would have liked to see. The leading cryptocurrency slipped to as low as $28,346 early Thursday, its weakest level since June 21. The decline extended a slide that began earlier this week and mirrored risk aversion on Wall Street. The formerly red-hot stock market averages have been slumping in August, with interest rate fears, banking sector concerns and worry heading the reasons to sell. The downside volatility in BTC comes days after the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed leveraged funds – hedge funds and commodity trading advisors – ramped up bearish bets in the CME-listed cash-settled bitcoin futures in the week ended Aug. 8.Payments giant PayPal will temporarily pause crypto purchases in the United Kingdom until early 2024, the company said Wednesday, citing stricter rules by the country’s financial regulator. Customers who have previously purchased crypto assets through their PayPal account can keep them on the platform or sell them at any time, said the company. Starting October 1, however, the ability to make new purchases will be disabled. “We're taking this measure in response to new rules enacted by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that require crypto firms to implement additional steps before customers can purchase crypto,” PayPal said in a statement. This comes as the company has accelerated its footprint in crypto in recent weeks, specifically in the United States with the launch of a stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), which the payments giant announced earlier this month.Jada AI, an artificial intelligence project that harnesses blockchain technology, has raised $25 million from alternative investment group LDA Capital. The project aims to offer AI services that aid decision-making for organizations and scale up their operations, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk. The capital will be used to grow the project’s team of developers and add new organizations. Jada operates in a blockchain-based environment where AI computations are executed among the nodes participating in the network. “This allows for the AI’s processing to be untampered, cross-verified and equally distributed to enable an efficient allocation of compute resources,” Jada AI founder Diego Torres told CoinDesk in an email.Story continuesChart of the dayThe chart shows the share of U.S.-based crypto exchanges and their global counterparts in the 2% market depth or global liquidity in bitcoin and ether trading pairs.The U.S. exchanges are losing liquidity, meaning traders can now execute large orders at stable prices on offshore exchanges.Liquidity is commonly tracked with the help of an indicator called the 2% market depth.

This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby poising Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX for growth.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at more than $75 per barrel.Dividend Stocks to Keep an Eye OnThe overall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks to GainMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. MPC is well poised to gain on strong refining fundamentals, backed by the reduction in refining capacity worldwide.

The percentage of people buying less Bud Light was reduced by 1.7% while the percentage buying more improved by 3.2%.Powering the budding comeback: consumption among those over the age of 25 and those earning less than $25,000 a year.Deutsche Bank also found that disenchanted Bud Light drinkers may return in substantive quantity by early 2024.""Crucially, the proportion of former Bud Light drinkers who say they are very unlikely to buy the brand in 3-6 months time has reduced from 18% to just 3%, a significant improvement,"" the report's lead author Mitch Collett wrote. ""Our data also suggests that Corona and Heineken remain the main beneficiaries of Bud Light's losses, however, the gains are lower vs July.""Collett reiterated a Buy rating on Bud Light maker Anheuser-Busch InBev's stock (BUD), citing its attractive valuation in the context of what could be a rebound in the company's key brand.That said, what consumers say they will do and what they actually do aren't always the same.Bud Light sales tanked 26.5% for the week ending Aug. 5, per new Nielsen data. That's a faster pace than the week-on-week drop of 25.9% for the period ending June 17.Bud Light volumes crashed 29.7%, accelerating from the week earlier's plunge of 29.3%.The sluggish stretch for Bud Light started after transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney created an Instagram post during the March Madness basketball tournament endorsing the light beer.Following the post on April 1, AB InBev saw Bud Light sales trend lower through April. The declines appeared to accelerate following an April 3 video from country musician Kid Rock, which spurred a wider boycott by many on the right.Story continuesTo try and stem the sales weakness, Budweiser offered US consumers in most states a rebate of up to $15 on a 15-pack or larger for July 4. The company has also reportedly been discounting Bud Light at retailers since the July 4 promotion.By all indications, the gambit hasn't paid off.Bud Light beer cans sit on the ledge during an NHL hockey game on Nov. 28, 2022, at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Mich. (Scott W. Grau/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)The sales pressure has stretched well into the peak summer drinking months as the uproar has continued to play out on social media and in national headlines.And there are two things making matters worse for Anheuser-Busch InBev.First, rival Heineken is actively courting disenchanted Bud Light consumers.A Heineken spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo Finance that it will spend $100 million to market a new light beer called Heineken Silver to consumers. The company plans to give away 2 million free samples this year as part of that initiative.And secondly, the controversy continues to weigh on the rest of the beer giant's portfolio.For the week ending Aug. 5, Michelob Ultra volumes fell by 2.9% and Busch Light declined by 7.3%. Both were accelerated declines from the prior week. Budweiser volumes fell 14.7% in the latest measurement week.""We assume no recovery in Bud Light [this year],"" RBC Capital Markets analyst James Jones said in a note this week.Anheuser-Busch InBev stock has fallen over 5% in the past six months as the sales declines persist.

The linchpin of this transformation has been its proprietary Ultium EV platform, which draws its power from Ultium battery cells. Despite committing substantial resources to foster a shift to EV production and constructing expansive battery manufacturing facilities in North America, GM's prime focus has been on scaled cell production, with comparatively fewer resources dedicated to R&amp;D in battery chemistries. This is where Mitra Chem comes into play.The Power of AI in Battery DevelopmentStartups like Mitra Chem are revolutionizing the field with their cutting-edge technologies. They are not only devising new battery chemistries at scale but achieving this at an astonishing rate. Consequently, GM's collaboration with Mitra Chem has a clear mandate — the co-development of iron-based cathodes and the exploration of novel cell chemistries.By taking the lead in a $60 million Series B financing round for Mitra Chem, General Motors is essentially investing in the future of EV batteries. Mitra Chem’s state-of-the-art AI platform and its premier R&amp;D facility based in Mountain View, CA are set to be the catalysts in GM's quest for commercially viable and affordable EV batteries.Co-Development of Advanced Iron-Based CathodeOne of the key collaborations between GM and Mitra Chem revolves around the development of advanced iron-based cathode active materials (CAM), such as lithium manganese iron phosphate. These CAMs are envisioned to power cost-effective EV batteries that are synergistic with GM’s Ultium Platform. With GM's funding, Mitra Chem can amplify its operations and hasten its market introduction of innovative battery materials.Story continuesGil Golan, GM's vice president of Technology Acceleration and Commercialization, outlined the strategic nature of this investment, emphasizing its alignment with GM's larger vision in battery technology and U.S.-focused battery supply chains.Accelerating Battery R&amp;D With Machine LearningWhat sets Mitra Chem apart is its unique R&amp;D facility that can mimic, create and evaluate thousands of cathode designs each month. This robust capacity drastically reduces learning cycles, paving the way for a swifter market introduction of new battery cell formulas.Mitra Chem's innovative ""atoms-to-tons acceleration platform"" harnesses the prowess of simulations and physics-informed machine learning models. This will aid in expediting various processes from formulation discovery and cathode synthesis optimization to cell-lifetime evaluation and process scale-up.Broader Implications for the U.S. MarketThis collaboration promises not just technological advancements but also economic implications.

SNDR is benefiting from a decrease in operating expenses and shareholder-friendly initiatives adopted by the company. Shares of Schneider have gained 27.8% so far this year, outperforming the 3.8% surge of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSNDR recently reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 38% from the year-ago quarter’s levels. Operating revenues of $1,346.5 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,459 million and fell 23% year over year. Revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) decreased 20% to $1,190.9 million.How is Schneider Doing?We are impressed with the company's efforts to reward shareholders even in the current uncertain times. To this end, in February 2023, the company's board approved a 12.5% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 9 cents per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. Such moves instill investors’ confidence in the stock. In February 2023, SNDR announced the approval of a $150 million stock repurchase program. As of Jun 30, 2023, SNDR has repurchased shares worth $36.1 million under the program and paid $31.8 million in the form of dividends to shareholders year to date.Fall in operating expenses, mainly due to low purchased transportation costs (plunged 31.7% in second-quarter 2023) and other general expenses (declined 25.4%), might have aided bottom-line growth. Total operating expenses decreased 20.8% year over year in second-quarter 2023 to $1,242.7 million.On the flip side, Schneider's second-quarter 2023 revenues were unfavorably impacted by weakness across all segments. Truckload revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) for the second quarter of 2023 fell 7% year over year owing to lower network prices driven by market conditions. Intermodal revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) fell 22% year over year due to lower volume and revenue per order. Logistics revenues (excluding fuel surcharge) for the second quarter of 2023 fell 34% year over year, owing to a decline in revenue per order impacted by lower spot prices and a 10% decrease in brokerage volume.Story continuesSchneider’s board has decreased its adjusted EPS guidance for 2023 in the range of $1.75 - $1.90 (prior view: $2.00 - $2.20). The decreased outlook might have been due to the currently challenged freight environment.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Schneider carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are United Airlines (UAL) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW).

Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) is benefiting from a decrease in operating expenses and shareholder-friendly initiatives adopted by the company.The company recently reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 90 cents, which aligned with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined 66.2% year over year. Total revenues of $4421.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4646.5 million and declined 35% year over year owing to lower pricing in the company’s ocean and truckload services.How is C.H. Robinson Doing?C.H. Robinson’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In November 2022, the company hiked its dividend to 61 cents per share from 55 cents. CHRW is also active on the buyback front. C.H. Robinson rewarded its shareholders in 2022 through a combination of cash dividends ($285.32 million) and share repurchases ($1,488.28 million). Continuing the shareholder-friendly approach, in the second quarter of 2023, CHRW repurchased shares worth $33.4 million and paid $72.8 million in cash dividends.Decrease in operating expenses aids C.H. Robinson’s bottom-line results. Operating expenses declined 5.2% year over year to $532.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Personnel expenses decreased 15.2% to $377.3 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation.On the flip side, C.H. Robinson's second-quarter 2023 total revenues were unfavorably impacted by lower pricing its ocean and truckload services. Quarterly results were impacted by soft freight markets globally. Overall, weak demand, high inventories and excess capacity led to a more competitive marketplace and subdued transportation rates.Adjusted gross profit fell 35.5% year over year to $665.5 million in second-quarter 2023, owing to lower adjusted gross profit per transaction in truckload and ocean services. Adjusted operating margin of 19.9% declined 2,560 basis points.Story continuesThe company’s focus on making investments in technology, though aimed at long-term growth prospects, might weigh on C.H.

The buoyant demand scenario may be attributable to the continued expansion of global express and e-commerce markets. This, in turn, has made the ATSG stock an attractive investment opportunity currently.Let’s delve deep to unearth the factors working in favor of the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have been revised 7% and 8.6% upward over the past 60 days, respectively. Such favorable estimate revisions reflect brokers’ confidence in the stock.Given the wealth of information at the brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because it serves as a key indicator in determining the price of a stock.Bullish Industry Rank: The industry, to which ATSG belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 32 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places Air Transport Services in the top 13% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.In fact, an ordinary stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into consideration becomes imperative.Demand Surge: The uptrend with respect to e-commerce even in the post-pandemic scenario is a huge positive for Air Transport Services. E- commerce growth is the primary driver behind the uptick in demand for midsize air freighters.With shippers replacing their older, less fuel-efficient equipment, ATSG’s freighters have emerged as suitable replacements. Driven by the upbeat demand, ATSG has delivered a record six converted freighters under lease in a month to its customers worldwide.Impressive Price Performance:  Shares of ATSG have gained 28.5% over the past three months compared with its industry’s growth of 4.7%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Other Key PicksInvestors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may also consider stocks like United Airlines UAL and GXO Logistics GXO.

My first thought when I saw the results was that maybe the consumer has some spending power left despite two years of rampant inflation.""The economy is so hard to predict,"" Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins told me midweek at our NYC headquarters. I agree with Chuck!Then there was the mother of all weirdness: This week's reads on US consumers apart from the barrage of upbeat government data, which I never have been a fan of.Home Depot's CEO Ted Decker opted against making a bottom call for the economy and housing market earlier in the week.Cheap chic merchandise purveyor Target issued a big-time earnings warning for the full year.When I caught up with Target CEO Brian Cornell and CFO Michael Fiddelke, they voiced greater concern about the economy than the last time we chatted about earnings three months ago.morning brief imageFiddelke specifically called out looming student loan repayments as a key factor in some very cautious third quarter guidance — even if some analysts are downplaying it.Cornell said the back-to-school shopping season had a ""solid"" start, but to me that rings hollow given the 5.4% comparable sales drop and guidance cut.A day after Target reported, Walmart blew the minds of an already bullish Wall Street. Big sales gains in stores and online. Grocery sales crushed it. Full-year guidance lifted. What a different vibe than Target's earnings!""Historically, our value proposition has been known for everyday low prices and for providing that value for customers. And what we see right now is that convenience resonates just as much to our customer base. And if you're a household that makes over $100,000 a year, you value convenience just as much as the next person,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told me.Story continuesThe read from those I talked with: This was another quarter where higher-income households traded down from Target and went to Walmart.But what's unclear is why are they trading down at all given the strength we're seeing in other categories, like fast-casual restaurants?IPO juggernaut Cava came out with an incredible earnings report this week showing same-store sales up 18.2%. People may be trading down, but they're still spending.My Cava bowl last weekend on Long Island cost $16. Sure, I got a ton of food. But I used to be able to feed myself for days for $16! So while people are cutting trips to Target and Home Depot, they apparently have a few bucks for a $16 Cava bowl with crazy feta in an urban market.In my view, the economy is weird right now, and stock prices aren’t priced for weird.

Full-year expectations were for earnings of $4.01 to $4.08 per share on sales of $57B to $58.2B; analysts were seeking $4.04 per share on $58.4B in revenue.CEO Chuck Robbins said on the earnings call that Cisco is poised for ""further share gains"" in campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing, having gained ""over 3 percentage points of market share"" vs. the prior year in those key areas, and believes the company is ""super well positioned"" on AI.Following these results, analysts at BofA, Citi, and KeyBanc all kept their neutral ratings on the stock.BofA and KeyBanc highlighted the company's solid execution and innovation, but BofA sees ""additional risk to estimates"" given a ""diminishing backlog contribution"" that would necessitate a ""significant order recovery throughout F24, which might not materialize."" And KeyBanc is staying neutral until it sees ""move consistent consistent signs of share gains and improved visibility into F2H24 order growth ramp.""Citi similarly said it is staying on the sidelines until it sees further market share gains in ""switch and security,"" adding that Cisco's talk of AI share gains was ""encouraging,"" but ""we await third party data verification to get more excited about share gains.""Story continuesEvercore, however, maintained its Outperform rating on Cisco and raised the target price by $3 to $63, arguing that the fiscal 2024 guidance is ""fairly conservative with room for upside"" across multiple segments. It also believes the company's commitment to ""showing operating leverage,"" and more consistent share buyback of some $1.5B quarterly, ""will resonate with investors and provide higher predictability for CSCO shareholders going forward.""Cisco shares closed Thursday at $54.73.Walmart beats, shares still slipThanks to a surfeit of budget-conscious shoppers, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said Q2 same-store sales (excluding gas) rose 6.3% from the prior year, better than the 4% estimates, and the world's largest retailer also boosted its full-year guidance.The company now sees full-year adjusted EPS at $6.36 to $6.46, well ahead of its prior range of $6.10 to $6.20. Analysts polled by InvestingPro were looking for an average of $6.28. And its top line is projected to grow by about 4% to 4.5% in all of fiscal 2024, up from the prior estimate of some 3.5%.Walmart also said Q2 earnings totaled $1.84 per share, beating the $1.69 Street expectation.Still, shares slipped 2.2% Thursday after a jump in premarket trading.CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement that Walmart's food segment had been a source of ""strength"" for the group in the 13 weeks ended on July 29. Groceries have been a key performance driver for Walmart during a recent bout of elevated inflation in the U.S., helping the business overcome a broader pullback in spending on nonessential items that has hit peers like DIY chain Home Depot and big-box firm Target.Shares ended Thursday at $155.69.Target results better than fearedMeanwhile, a day earlier, Walmart-rival Target (NYSE:TGT) saw shares rise 3% on a guidance revision that was less egregious than feared.Target's Q2 comps slid 5.4%, worse than the expected 3.8% decline. Revenue reached $24.8B, a decrease of 4.9% compared with $25.33B in the prior year.Gross margin improved to 27%, surpassing last year's 21.5% and exceeding the estimated 25.6%.Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.80, easily ahead of the expected $1.47.For Q3, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.60, well under the $1.84 consensus, while also lowering EPS estimates by $0.75 to a range of $7 to $8. Analysts were widely expecting Target to lower its guidance, and the delivered cut was seen by the market as better than feared.RBC also said the guidance ""could be conservative as mgmt looks to set a floor. All in all, barring any negative surprises on current comp trends, we think there's enough here to get shares moving in the right direction.""Citi also noted the recent negative sentiment around the stock, which explained the sigh of relief from the market regarding its guidance revision.Target shares closed Wednesday at $128.75.Home Depot tops consensusHome Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) posted Q2 comps, net sales, and EPS declines that were less steep than anticipated on Tuesday.Comparable-store sales were down 2% vs. Wall Street expectations for a 4.1% decline, and its top line was down 2% from the prior year to $42.9B, but analysts were looking for $42.1B. EPS came to $4.65, a slide from last year's $5.05 but better than the $4.46 consensus.Home Depot maintained its outlook for the fiscal year 2024, expecting comps to fall in a range of 2% to 5% and an EPS decline of 7% to 13%.CEO Ted Decker acknowledged ""continued pressure in certain big-ticket, discretionary categories"" even amid strength in categories associated with smaller home-improvement projects, adding, ""We remain very positive on the medium-to-long term outlook for home improvement and our ability to grow share in a large and fragmented market.”Shares traded up fractionally to $332.14 on Tuesday.Applied Materials trounces guidance expectationsFinally, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) delivered blowout earnings guidance after the bell Thursday after fiscal third-quarter results beat analyst estimates as the ongoing enterprise race to join the digital and AI era supported chip demand and bolstered growth.Fiscal Q4 adjusted EPS is expected at $1.82 to $2.18, smashing the consensus for $1.59, and sales of approximately $6.51B trounced the 5.87B average target.For Q3, adjusted EPS totaled $1.90, comfortably topping estimates for $1.74, and revenue of $6.43B surpassed the $6.15B average estimate.Sales in semiconductor systems, the company's largest business, fell 1.2% to $4.68B.Bernstein raised Applied Materials' price target to $175 from $150 after these results.Shares were rising 3% to $141.76 in premarket trading Friday.Yasin Ebrahim, Scott Kanowsky, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Analysts wary after Cisco's beat; retailers a mixed bagEuropean shares set for third straight weekly loss as rate jitters, China woes loom largeEuropean stocks weaken; U.K. retail sales slump]"

Strategic Resource Group Managing Director Burt Flickinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Walmart's (WMT) dominance over smaller chain retailers, calling the momentum seen in its second-quarter earnings ""unstoppable.""""There's a real need for Kroger and Albertson's to combine to be the first supermarket chain to have the size and the scale to compete with Walmart, Costco, Aldi's, Amazon,"" Flickinger says on the potential merger between supermarkets Kroger (KR) and Albertsons (ACI).Flickinger contrasts Kroger's competitive food pricing and the support of its union workers to the growth of big-box retailers, calling the latter an enablement to ""steamroll across America and crush co-op food retailers in the process.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Walmart shares closing the day in the red, off just over 2%. The retail giant posting better than expected results, and one of the main driver was grocery sales. And it has been a busy week here in that area of the retail space. Aldi acquiring 400 Winn-Dixie and Harveys supermarket stores which will expand Aldi's growing us footprint into the south.It also comes as two other grocers face more headwinds in their mergers deal, Kroger's and Albertsons. Seven states calling on US antitrust officials to block the nearly $25 billion tie up claiming that it's going to hurt Americans. Joining me now is Burt Flickinger, Strategic Resource Group managing director.Burt, it's great to see you again. So let's first start with what we heard from Walmart this morning because this massive push that the company is doing in the grocery business as it stands right now controls nearly a quarter of the grocery market here in the US. Is anything going to stop Walmart's momentum in the grocery business?BURT FLICKINGER: Seana, you're completely correct. Walmart's momentum is unstoppable, and, as you referenced, Walmart has the highest grocery sales and the highest grocery market share in the 200-year history of supermarkets and food retailers across America. Amazon is growing as well.Story continuesAnd Walmart has site saturated the south where all these going in after buying Winn-Dixie. Winn-Dixie, as you reported well with Diane, Winn-Dixie filed for bankruptcy twice. Anthony Hucker came in-- brilliantly turned around Winn-Dixie. But all these going into the southeast in key states, especially in the Gulf Coast region where Walmarts wiped out in many cases the number one, two, and three ranked supermarket chains-- Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, et cetera.SEANA SMITH: So Bert, where does that leave the smaller rivals? Are we going to see more bankruptcies, more store closures because they simply cannot compete with the much larger players?BURT FLICKINGER: Seana, and you referenced it well earlier, there's a real need for Kroger and Albertsons to combine to be the first true supermarket chain to have the size and the scale to compete with Walmart, Costco, all the Amazon, which between the four of them control over half the sales. And Walmart is significantly ahead of Kroger and Albertsons at this point.Also, Kroger and Albertsons share their private label manufacturing capacity with other independently owned chains, family-owned and operated chains co-ops. My Flickinger family forefathers and relatives cofounded IGA, founded Red &amp; White, founded Federated Foods through Revco, which they also cofounded, started Trader Joe's.And the National Grocers Association is made up of many of these independents which will benefit. And in fact, in the state of Minnesota, which is opposing this deal, where we've worked closely with the unions, closely with the chains, closely with the independents, before Kroger bought Roundy's out of Wisconsin and Illinois, Rainbow Foods, which was owned by Roundy's, went bankrupt and liquidated in Minnesota. That would have never happened had Kroger come in earlier and bought Rainbow Stores and not let the prior owner run them into bankruptcy.So Kroger-Albertsons is pro-consumer, pro-worker, pro-supplier, pro-community. And a lot of those shopping centers at Kroger and Albertsons saves, Seana, pay the school taxes for the public school education in just about every state across America. So it's good for the competition. It'll lower prices. Kroger's lowered prices $5 billion in the last 20 years and has increased middle class workers living standards by having over 110,000 union employees where many of the other unionized employers and unions have contracted.And the unions and the supermarket sector have lost over 150,000 jobs in a study we recently completed Strategic Resource Group with the help of Cornell Industrial and Labor Relations and the US Department of Labor. So it's good all the way around and happy to testify and for any of the state AGs, the Federal Trade Commission as we've done frequently in the past.SEANA SMITH: So Burt, I called the National Grocers Association the other day just to get their perspective. And they take the other side of it obviously, no surprise there. But they're arguing though, that this is going-- if we do see Kroger and Albertsons deal go through that it is going to increase anti-competitive buyer power over some of those suppliers, which is eventually then going to harm consumers. You don't see any risk of that?BURT FLICKINGER: No, Seana, because I in fact work for a number of the independents and co-ops that supply the chains that are family owned and operated and single store independents. And those chains were discriminated against by the national brand manufacturers the same way Kroger and Albertsons was during the COVID pandemic while the supercenter and wholesale club operators were getting just about everything that those respective food retail competitors had ordered.And I know from our extensive work in private label manufacturing and sourcing that everybody benefits from supermarket sector sharing, sourcing from the farms to the food warehouses to the food manufacturers to the food stores. And there's some unique members of the National Grocers Association that are raising some concerns.But at the same time, SM Flickinger company created over 10,000 independents in the US and Canada between IGA and Red &amp; White and being very close to those independents. It's very pro-independent for Kroger and Albertsons to combine rather than just let Walmart, Costco, and Amazon steamroll across America and crush independent and chain and co-op food retailers in the process.SEANA SMITH: So, Burt, the odds that this deal is going to get FTC approval, what do you think?BURT FLICKINGER: I think the FTC is very enlightened. It's had no enforcement in my professional view and prior FTC regimes in terms of anti-competitive practices and predatory pricing. And your good point Seana, buying practices which are brutal in the case of Walmart and in the case of Costco.Bob Ortega and Steven Greenhouse in their respective books coming out of ""The Wall Street Journal"" and ""The New York Times"" have brilliantly written how Walmart's has destroyed a lot of American manufacturers through their brutal buying practices in the past. Doug McMillon, the current CEO, is very enlightened and very magnanimous, but historically Walmart's had a checkered past.So it's better to have at least a supermarket chain with national cloud. And Kroger and Albertsons support local vendors from Paul's Chicken in Boise, Idaho to Graeter's Ice Cream in Ohio, to Murray's Cheese out of Greenwich Village in New York.And my great grandfather started when Barney Kroger had one store and Joe Albertson had one store. They all worked together to help independents, and they'll continue to do so.SEANA SMITH: We, of course, will continue to track this story. Burt Flickinger, always great to get your perspective. Thanks.]"

Retail sales for July were up 0.7% from the previous month, which was well above estimates of 0.4%. This among a number of other economic data points are say one thing quite emphatically, the US economy is very strong. Further confirming this notion, is GDP growth estimates. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta provides a nowcast estimating US annual economic growth and revised the number this week to 5.8%.  Consumers Favor DiscountsHowever, contrary to this data, we saw an interesting trend emerge from the totality of these earnings. Consumers are shifting their buying patterns to make more purchases at discount retailers.While both Target and Home Depot beat earnings estimates, Target missed on sales, and both retailers are expecting slower growth over the next year. Home Depot reiterated its forward guidance after lowering the outlook last quarter and Target guided lower on both sales and revenue forecasts.Target CEO Brian Cornell noted on the earnings call that “As we look at the consumer landscape today, we recognize the consumer is still challenged by the levels of inflation that they’re seeing in food and beverage and household essentials…So that’s absorbing a much bigger portion of their budget.”On the flip side, both Walmart and The TJX Companies raised forward guidance and beat sales and earnings estimates.Not too surprisingly, Walmart and The TJX Companies enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, while Target and Home Depot have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide with 4,865 stores. The company’s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. Additionally, TJX attracts consumers through rapid turn of inventories, which makes for an always fresh range of discounted products.Story continuesOn Wednesday, TJX reported Q2 earnings. EPS came in at $0.85, a 23% YoY increase and well above estimates of $0.77. Sales $12.76 billion also beat estimates of $12.45 billion and showed a 7.7% YoY gain.TJX has begun to see analysts revise earnings estimates higher, with both FY23 and FY24 earnings being upgraded by 1% over the last month. Both sales and earnings are projected to grow at a very nice pace over the next two years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of TJX blasted to all-time highs following the stellar earnings report and are now up 13.2% YTD. The TJX Companies stock has compounded at an annual rate of 14% over the last ten years, outperforming the broad market.TJX is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25x, which is below the industry average of 27x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x. Additionally, the company offers a dividend yield of 1.5% and has raised the payment by an average of 9.7% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWalmartSurprisingly, Walmart shares are selling off following its exceptional earnings report. Nonetheless, the stock looks very appealing at the current levels, and new business verticals at the retail giant look to be paying off.WMT has been gaining momentum in two of its high margin revenue streams; advertisements and its membership program Walmart+. Walmart has added in-store ads in the aisles, on the checkout screens, and played over the stores radio, and has recruited its most engaged customers to its membership program. These developments have been critical in raising earnings expectations. The advertisement business grew a reported 36% YoY.Walmart also saw momentum in its e-commerce business. Online sales jumped 24% YoY.Analysts have taken notice and began raising earnings estimates over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been raised by 1.2%, and FY23 estimates by 0.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25.5x, which is above the industry average of 23.2x, and above its five-year median of 23.4x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 1.4% and has raised it by an average of 1.9% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTarget After trading immediately lower following the earnings report, Target stock has recovered and rallied ~5% off its 2023 lows. And while investors may want to wait for analysts to begin revising their earnings estimates higher, raising its Zacks Rank, TGT is now trading at a fairly compelling valuation.Target is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is well below the industry average of 27x, and below its five-year median of 18.3x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 3.4% and has raised the payment by an average of 13% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdmittedly, earnings estimates have been revised lower almost unanimously by analysts. Current quarter earnings estimates have been downgraded by -7.4% and FY23 earnings estimates by -4.5%.However, another point on the bullish side is that EPS are projected to grow nicely in the coming quarters. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 23% YoY to $1.89 and FY23 EPS are forecast to grow 31% YoY to $7.88. This follows management’s effort to build back profitability at the retailer.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTarget shares are now -50% off their all-time high. The stock has compounded at an annual rate of 8.1% over the last 20 years, underperforming the broad market.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewHome DepotHome Depot has compounded at an incredible 15% annually over the last 20 years, far outperforming the broad market. HD also offers a dividend yield of 2.5% and has raised it by an average of 14.5% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, as fantastic as the stock has been over the years, the near future may be a bit rocky. While HD reported EPS of $4.65 beating estimates of $4.45 it showed a YoY decline from $5.05. Sales also beat estimates and showed a slight decline YoY.The earnings revision trend has been mixed, giving HD a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but forecasts are weak over the next year. Sales and earnings are expected to fall through the year end. Although there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sales and earnings growth are expected to resume in FY24.While HD management still believes their core customers are in a healthy place economically, the reality is that Covid pulled forward a lot of DIY home improvement sales. With people stuck at home during the pandemic, many homeowners opted to do work on their homes, and are not yet at the point where they need to do more.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHome Depot is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.3x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and just above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe US economy is in an interesting position, and this week’s retail earnings provided some useful information. Obviously, the economy is growing at a nice pace, however the average American is still dealing with a tight budget, forced to cut certain expenses to cover the necessities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Qontigo Managing Director of Applied Research Melissa Brown says investors seem to have ""bought on the rumor and are now selling on the news."" Brown says that consumers starting to trade down may be ""a little signal that the economy is not going to be as strong as we expect."" On the other hand Brown says, ""some of these profits look pretty good, even in the face of inflation. It could potentially give the Fed a little more reason to tighten."" ""Either the recessionary scenario or the tightening scenario is not particularly good for stocks overall,"" Brown said.Video Transcript- Of the retailers who have reported this earnings season, nearly 80% are seeing profit beats. That's according to the latest data from LSEG. But it's not all upbeat news, though, for retailers. Many are seeing consumers pull back amid a sticky inflation.For more, we want to bring in Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo. Melissa, it's good to see you here. So on the one side, you're seeing a group of retailers, the likes of Walmart, outperform in this type of environment. You're seeing other retailers struggle because we have very sticky inflation, a higher interest rate environment. What has been your takeaway from the earnings season and what it tells us just about how consumer discretionary is positioned heading in to the final months of the year?MELISSA BROWN: Well, first of all, thank you for having me. I think these earnings are coming out. They look good. But investors are always thinking, what's the next step? What's going to be ahead from now? And I think the idea of consumers trading down the scale, maybe, is potential-- maybe it's a little signal that the economy is not going to be as strong as we expect it to.On the other hand, if you're seeing some of these profits look pretty good, even in the face of inflation, it could potentially give the Fed a little more reason to tighten. And so I think either of those, either the recessionary scenario or the tightening scenario, is not particularly good for stocks overall.Story continuesSo my take on what's happened with these earnings reports is that investors have bought on the rumor and are now selling on the news. And they're looking at what might be coming ahead, neither side of which is particularly good.- And I want to ask you, Melissa, is there also some of a kind of summer lull effect or stocks also just expensive from a historic perspective?MELISSA BROWN: Well, certainly, stocks are expensive, selling probably in the US at about 20 times earnings, although with a wide variation, given the different sectors of the economy. So stocks are expensive. What's been kind of interesting is that trading volume. We usually see a big summer lull.And I think we saw the summer lull wasn't in the summer. Actually, most of the spring, trading volume was very low. It has picked up more recently. And so if we're looking, for example, very recent trading volume is substantially higher than it was at this exact same time last year. So I think investors are tiptoeing back into the market after having been out for many months. At least they're showing up and doing more trading than they had been.- Melissa, when it comes to what the investor, what markets are pricing in for future Fed rate hikes, so it seems like there's certainly been a little bit of a shift, at least when you take a look at the activity that we're seeing in the bond market today, with the 10-year yield, the highest level that we've seen since last October. And you have these readings that the consumer is still spending. Another print for jobless claims coming in better than expected. Is it too early to say that maybe the Fed is done raising rates?MELISSA BROWN: I think it's too early, yes, to say that the Fed is done raising rates. They seem to have indicated that they don't see a huge need for further rate hikes. But that doesn't mean in the face of potential inflationary exposure, that they would not raise rates. So yeah, I think it is too early.- And so, Melissa, I want to ask you just to expand on what we're looking for, following earnings season. It's wrapping up now. And the next big ticket, we're going to be looking at economic data, hearing Fed speak. We'll hear more about rates probably when the Fed heads to Jackson Hole. We know it's the hottest economic ticket in town. So what are you expecting to hear from that coming up?MELISSA BROWN: Well, I think what we're going to be mainly focused on is that inflation number. The last report was up a little bit from the prior report. And so I think clearly, the Fed's going to be looking at that. They're going to be-- I'm sure they're going to be talking about it at Jackson Hole.But I think investors also are going to be looking to see one uptick. Maybe it does not indicate a trend. But if we see another uptick in inflation, even if it's still much lower than it had been, I think that could cause at least a bit of concern on the part of investors.- Melissa, when it comes to the positioning then, given all this, there's so much uncertainty out there. The data, at least to this point, not enough, like you said, to say-- for at least definitively say that the Fed is done raising rates. So what do investors do in this type of environment?MELISSA BROWN: Well, we've seen that investors have become more risk averse. So they're buying, say, higher dividend yield stocks, or cheaper stocks, or more profitable stocks. And so I think that the view is that we want to be in stocks, but we don't necessarily want to be in the riskiest names. And even recently, we're seeing that with some of the technology names giving back some of their gains.I think investors are looking to be a little bit more cautious. What we've said in the past is that a lot of the really risk-averse investors have gotten out because rates have been high for a while now. So if you could get a decent return in a bond, those really, really risk-averse investors have moved to the bond market. But there are still obviously investors left, and I think they're moving a little bit along that scale to risk aversion.- So, Melissa, what puts that risk aversion to bed? What is the next catalyst? Is it the Fed saying, OK, we're done, we've reached the scenario of we can achieve this soft landing?MELISSA BROWN: I think there would have to be very strong indications that we would either hit a soft landing or maybe no landing to really cause a big stampede back into the market. So I think that probably is going to be the catalyst. But on the other hand, investors haven't been expecting that for a while, if you look at expectations. It is that rates are going to be coming down starting next year.So if rates are coming down without having a recession, maybe that's the best news we can hope for. But I think it's going to be tough. You've got high valuations. Stocks are expensive. And the economic news maybe is potentially already factored in, good economic news is factored in. So I'd be a little bit concerned.- All right. Well, we will be watching for what to hear from the Fed next. Melissa Brown of Qontigo, thank you so much.]"

Here to discuss we have Bernstein Senior Analyst Aneesha Sherman. Aneesha, thanks so much for joining us. So when you think about these retailers who have reported-- we have Walmart, The Target, we had TJX, what stands out to you as the trends that we are seeing this time around?ANEESHA SHERMAN: It is a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter, which is that, on top of 2022 super strong consumer demand, the consumer this year has been much more cautious, looking for deals, looking to trade down, looking to buy lower priced items within category, and to buy smaller baskets. And we're seeing that trend impact Walmart. Walmart is leaning into it and pricing better.Story continuesWe're seeing it in TJX, where TJX had average baskets slightly down, average ticket slightly down, but got the comp out of traffic because people are switching out of department stores and shopping at a Marmaxx-- a Marshalls, or TJ Maxx to get better value. So it is definitely the value-seeking behavior that has been consistently the trend across this week's retail results, and I expect that to continue with Ross tonight.- Yeah, Aneesha, when you take a look at Walmart's numbers here, just foot traffic up 2.8%. They also posted a higher ticket up 3.4% online sales, also on the rise for the quarter. When you talk about this trend, it's a continuation of what we've seen since the start of the year. Is this a trend that you see sticking through the end of the year?ANEESHA SHERMAN: I think so, yeah. I mean, Last year the lower income consumer was more pressured, but this year we've seen the cumulative effects of inflation and high rates impact not just low income, but middle income and slightly more premium consumers as well. So we're not just seeing it at those low tiers, we're seeing it across the economy, and we're seeing it across segments of retail as well, from discount all the way up to premium and accessible luxury. So I do expect it to continue for a little while longer.- And so Aneesha, when do you think this pattern breaks out? Because I remember seeing a cycle like this before. The last time around where I saw this trade down when you were thinking of even the higher income shopper going to-- switching and converting to TJ Maxx, The Marmaxx brands, was the Great Recession. I don't know if you're old enough to have been around then covering it. (LAUGHING) But want to ask is, do we see any kind of trend shifting away from that before the year is out, especially when you consider this back half of the year? It's such a crucial time for retailers.ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah. So the dynamics during the GFC were that, it was the big trade down event that actually really helped TJX and Ross. 2009 was one of the best years for TJX and Ross because we saw a huge amount of trade down. The big difference is, that was a sharp shock. Huge amount of consumers lost their jobs. They had to immediately shift their spending habits, and we had some really negative comps across retail.This time around it's been more slow. Unemployment still remains really low. People still have jobs. But it's inflation that's creeping up. And so the trade down has been more gradual. We've seen it happen over-- this is a third quarter now where we've seen traffic at these discount retailers up and traffic at the mainstream retailers down. And so that share shift is happening more slowly. It's not ripping off a Band-Aid. It's going to be a slow burn for the next couple of quarters.- So Aneesha, let's talk about the other end of the spectrum when we take a look at the luxury consumer. Tapestry was out with its results. Disappointing year. US demand clearly waning a bit, at least when you take a look at these numbers. Before we talk about their acquisition last week, what can you-- is this a start of a trend just in terms of weakness that we're seeing in luxury here in the US? And is that maybe indicative of what we could see overseas?ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah. These companies, these accessible luxury companies, as well as high luxury companies had a phenomenal year last year. They had limited supply. The consumer was out and about for the first time post COVID, and was eager to buy accessories, and ready-to-wear, and shoes for going back to weddings, and going on trips, and going back to work, and so on. So we had this huge wave of pent-up demand.And Tapestry's North America number was 26% growth last year, and this year it's about flat. So part of it is just lapping a very strong year. But beyond that, it's also indicative of this broader trend that we've been talking about. The consumer is getting more value-seeking, not interested in buying as many discretionary items, and is looking to do some trade down. So we've seen some of this flagging consumer demand across the luxury sector as well as further down the premium as well as mainstream retail.- Aneesha, I got to ask you, what do you make of that deal of Tapestry and Capri, especially when you think about that point about the direction that you've seen some of Tapestry brands go. I've seen more coach bags than I could remember in-- I never used to see them in TJ Maxx. I've seen a bunch of them now. And when you think about them purchasing-- I mean, we've seen cause in decline. Does this even make sense from your point of view?ANEESHA SHERMAN: Short-term, it deteriorates the quality of the Tapestry portfolio because the company they're buying is a slower growth, lower margin company. They're levering up to do it so it deteriorates their balance sheet. They're pausing their buybacks so it takes a few off their earnings growth for the next couple of years. So on all metrics, it's a lower quality company now and is valued it should be valued at a lower multiple.However, long-term rationale makes sense, which is basically that, they are trying to gain scale in the luxury market. To run a direct to consumer luxury brand, you need a lot of scale. You need to invest in brand building, and marketing, and real estate, and flagship stores, and events, and you can do that much better when you have better firepower in terms of higher cash flows, higher marketing budget, and that's a lot easier to do when you are a $12 to $15 billion brand than when you're a 6 to $7 billion brand. So that is the long term rationale, which I think makes sense. But short-term, it does deteriorate the quality of the company.- Aneesha, do you see Tapestry after acquiring Capri-- is it going to be a real competitor to some of the larger players, the leaders in this space when you take a look at LVMH and also Kering? I don't think we're going to see it replace LVMH or Kering any time soon. However, I think it will start to access the lower end of that demand. So accessible luxury band within a Kering, or within some of these other high luxury brands, is what they're looking for.They're not looking to be the next Chanel. I don't think that's feasible. I think they're looking to take a step up. And in order to do that, they need to attract a different consumer, a higher end consumer, and they need this kind of marketing brand building ability to do that, and they need the scale for that to work. So it does make sense. I don't think it's going to end up being a high luxury brand any time soon, but I think it's going to take a step up from where it is now.- Well, we're certainly seeing them build the scale. We'll see if they build up the luxury cachet that they're trying to go for. Aneesha Sherman, thank you so much.]"

Corp (VFC) Amid Tough Environment?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/growth-efforts-aid-v-f-153100063.html,1692286260,STORY,"['VFC', 'GIII', 'RCL']","[V.F. Corporation VFC has been witnessing a tough operating environment, a dismal wholesale performance and higher promotions. This led to a sluggish year-over-year top and bottom-line performance in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently, VFC has lost 1.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4%.The adjusted loss per share was 15 cents against adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The metric came wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents per share. Revenues of $2,086.3 million fell 8% year over year and remained flat on a two-year basis. At constant-currency (cc), revenues also dipped 8% year over year.The top line was hurt by a dismal wholesale performance, and sluggishness in the Americas and EMEA regions, which was partially offset by growth in the APAC region. Channel-wise, wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 12% and 3% year over year on a reported basis, respectively. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research In the said quarter, the adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 52.8% due to elevated promotional activity and higher product costs. The metric reflected 200 bps of adverse rate impact (including promotions) and 10 bps of adverse foreign currency exchange rates, partly offset by 80 bps of mix benefits.The adjusted operating loss was $7.9 million against an adjusted operating income of $77.5 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. The adjusted operating margin of 0.4% was down 380 bps due to a 130-bps impact of adverse gross margin and 250 bps of deleverage.However, VFC is focused on lowering working capital and optimizing inventories. It has been accelerating its cost-saving efforts, which are likely to generate $225 million annually after the completion of its previously announced actions in fiscal 2024.Also, the North Face and China businesses have been experiencing momentum. The company is also seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, allowing it to capitalize on revenue opportunities.It continues to see growing momentum in the APAC region, with revenue growth of 13% on a reported basis (up 18% at cc). In the aforementioned region, revenues across all channels grew in the double digits, driven by brick-and-mortar traffic growth. Greater China witnessed an acceleration of 31% and benefited from the comparison to the prior-year lockdown impacts.The North Face continues to be the key growth driver in this region, with revenue growth of more than 50% in Greater China on the back of outdoor market tailwinds and recovering domestic travel. Evidently, North Face emerged as the number one international outdoor brand in China.V.F. Corp is benefitting from the acquisition of the privately-owned streetwear brand — Supreme. Its strong follower base in the younger generation bodes well for the company.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds are concerning, management expects better second-half revenue performance than the first half on an improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing year-over-year comparisons. These factors are likely to aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.90 has underperformed the industry’s ratio of 12.44, which raises optimism about the stock. Topping it, a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and G-III Apparel GIII.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. RCL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.4%, on average.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Royal Caribbean (RCL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Royal Caribbean currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.64, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.64 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for RCLBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for RCLCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Royal Caribbean here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Royal Caribbean, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is RCL a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Royal Caribbean, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 31.6% over the past month to $6.02.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Royal Caribbean. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Royal Caribbean may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the bulls could not hold on, and after a slight surge after lunch, we saw indices sink near session lows by the close. The Dow shed -274 points, -0.79%, exactly the -0.79% posted by the S&amp;P 500. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 were hit even deeper, -1.18% and -1.14%, respectively.So far, this is shaping up to be the Nasdaq’s worst month all year, -7.22% already, with 10 days remaining for the month. The tech-heavy index and the S&amp;P both look ready to snap five-month winning streaks; we can say they were due for a correction, but they’re really getting hammered this August. The Russell, too: -6.38%. The Dow had been holding its head above water this month, but it’s down -1.37% in the past month.Call it “A Big Shakeout”: indices have ben off to the races since mid-spring, with the Nasdaq capping up +38% at couple small peaks last month. Of course we’re looking for a bounceback from a deeply challenging 2022, but gains of nearly 40% mid-year were bound to get smacked down to reality a bit. The good news here is that with Q2 guidance pointing in the right direction overall, what we’re looking at in our current bearish period looks less like a market melting down and more like a market slimming down to make advances once levels of resistance are hit.Applied Materials AMAT posted a strong beat-and-raise for its fiscal Q3 report out after today’s close, with earnings of $1.90 per share sailing past the $1.73 expected in the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $6.43 billion which easily cleared the $6.16 billion estimate. Further, the Silicon Valley semiconductor fabrication equipment supplier guided next-quarter earnings to a range of $1.82-2.18 per share, nicely above the $1.58 analysts had been expecting. Shares had jolted up more than +2.6% on the news in late trading, but have more recently abated to about half that level of gain in the after-market.Discount department store Ross Stores ROST also posted superior numbers compared to expectations in its Q2 report after today’s closing bell. Earnings of $1.32 per share bettered the $1.17 anticipated (and a strong improvement from the $1.11 per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on quarterly sales of $4.93 billion, nicely out in front of the $4.74 billion analysts were looking for. Guidance for both next quarter and full-year earnings were raised, as well. This makes five straight earnings beats, and shares +5.8% in today’s after market swing the stock into positive territory year to date.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

We've got three stocks for you. Ross Stores, Applied Materials, and Moderna.Kicking off with Ross Stores. And we're looking at a gain of just over 6% here in extended trading. A very solid earnings report here from the company. They also raised their earnings and sales outlook for the year. And they now expect positive same store sales for the year, seeing growth of 2% - 3%.Now that was up from what they were initially expecting, which was a flat sales for the year. When you take a look at the numbers for the second quarter, sales coming in at $4.93 billion. That's up 7% from just a year ago. Comp sales blowing past expectations, growing just about 5% for the quarter. We're looking at gains of nearly 9% in the last three months.When you take a look at that year-to-date chart, we have seen Ross Stores gain a bit of momentum since hovering right around its lows of the year back in June. So close today, right around $113 a share. We'll see whether or not this momentum after hours sticks for the opening bell tomorrow.Let's take a look at Applied Materials, a look here at the chip sector. And we're looking at gains of nearly 2% in extended trading. A strong forecast here from Applied Materials. Also another sign that maybe the slump that we've seen in the chip sector that it might continue to fade just a little bit.Now the company also beat on the top and bottom line for its fiscal third quarter earnings of $1.90 a share. Sales of $6.43 billion that came in better than the street was looking for. But it did decline just about 1.5% from a year ago.And rounding it out with Moderna. We're looking at losses of just about a tenth of a per cent. But a headline here, crossing in after hours trading. The company saying that its prelim trial data showed that its updated COVID vaccine generates robust immune response, and that they're expecting the updated vaccine expected in coming weeks pending approval.Obviously, now this is a stock that's lost a lot of its momentum as we have seen demand for the COVID vaccine really continue to wane. We're looking at losses of just about 40% year-to-date over the last year, slightly less. They're off just about 32%. But we certainly have seen the steady decline since the start of the year. Lots of concern just about what that demand picture is going to look like for Moderna for its vaccine here in the future.]"

We will also discuss the emerging trends in the fintech industry and the recent decline in global funding. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Fastest Growing Fintech Companies In 2023.Recent Trends In Fintech IndustryFintech is simply the use of technology and software in the financial sector. Fintech enables consumers to efficiently deal with their finances while bypassing the hassle of traditional banks. The emergence of the fintech industry bears immense significance as it can revolutionize financial services delivery globally. According to a report by EMR, the global fintech market was valued at $194.1 billion in 2022 and has been estimated to grow to $492.81 billion by 2028 at a compounded annual growth rate of 16.8%.The advancement of information technology globally has expanded the customer base for fintech. The pandemic catalyzed the widespread adoption of fintech. According to a report by BCG, in 2019, fintech received 20% of all global venture capital outlays, and by 2021 it represented 9% of all global financial service valuations. For almost a decade, fintech has received billions of dollars in funding; however, it started plummeting in 2022. Rising inflation and interest rates, growing geopolitical tensions, and supply chain problems have all contributed to this decline in funding. According to a report by CB Insights, global fintech funding dropped 46%, and deals fell 8% year over year from 2021 to 2022. During this time, there was also a drop in the number of fintech unicorns born. Therefore, 2022 was not the best year for fintech companies overall. This decline in global funding has continued in 2023 as well. According to another report by CB Insights, a 48% decline has been recorded in global fintech funding in 2023. Even the most valuable fintech companies in the world were not safe from the impact of this massive decline.Story continues Many fintech companies have shifted their focus towards unit economics to recover from the downturn. The companies aim to emerge stronger on the other side of this slow funding era by strengthening the business's fundamentals, like innovation and recurring customers. On July 19, Reuters reported that fintech companies have started to impose stricter lending standards amid the current funding environment easing their way to debt financing from Wall Street.On August 7, Reuters reported that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) launched a US dollar stablecoin making it the first major fintech company to conduct transactions in a digital currency. Stablecoins have a monetary value dependent on a stable asset which makes them relatively immune to drastic changes in their worth. Stablecoins are used mainly to buy other cryptocurrencies. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) enables users to redeem their stablecoins for US dollars at any given time. As of August 17, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is worth $64 billion on the open market.Regional Insights And Noteworthy CompaniesAccording to the report by BCG, Asia Pacific is on track to be the largest fintech market by 2030 at a projected CAGR of 27%. The APAC region has a massive underbanked population and growing attention toward tech-savvy solutions, making the perfect ingredients for rapid growth. China and India are expected to lead this transition. North America currently is the most dominant in the global fintech market, and the US is estimated to contribute significantly to total global fintech revenue through 2030. Europe also has immense potential and is expected to grow rapidly in terms of fintech. The BCG report estimates that the US and Europe will have a revenue CAGR of 17% and 21%, respectively. Moreover, Latin America and Africa are expected to be the fastest-growing regions in fintech by 2030. These regions have massive underbanked populations and are moving towards digitization, posing a great opportunity for fintech to grow. These numbers indicate that despite the current turbulent landscape the fintech industry has a lot of potential to grow. On June 28, Reuters reported that the payment giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is acquiring a Brazilian fintech startup named Pismo for $1 billion, marking the largest fintech exit in that region since Nubank (NYSE:NU) went public. Pismo will continue with its current management team under Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).  There are many fintech companies growing at a noteworthy rate in 2023. Some of the most prominent companies that have stood strong during this time include Nubank (NYSE:NU), LM Funding America, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMFA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the stock market in general, then take a look at Stanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stocks. The high interest rate environment which started to take shape last year has not been great for the hedge fund industry. Most funds tend to do well when the stock market as a whole is rising, but the energy supply shocks of 2023 effectively bifurcated the stock market into two segments. These included growth stocks that fell as inflation rose and purchasing powers dropped, and traditional sectors such as petroleum, gas, and coal which rose as investors tried to profit from an effective reworking of the global energy market.The fall in the grace of growth stocks last year also took down several hedge funds with it. As a whole, the industry lost $208 billion in 2022, with funds such as Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global and Dan Loeb's Third Point Capital losing more than $20 billion cumulatively. For more details, you can check out 15 Best Hedge Funds to Work For.Amidst this turmoil, one hedge fund boss that remained relatively unscathed was Stanley Druckenmiller. Mr. Druckenmiller has decades of experience in the finance industry, and he set up his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, in 1981. He is also one of the most famous hedge fund investors in the history of the industry. While some of our readers might only be young enough to remember the British Pound's crash last year that nearly sent it to parity levels with the U.S. dollar, the British currency underwent similarly rapid depreciations in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Mr. Druckenmiller, working for George Soros at that time, capitalized on the latter when they correctly bet that the British government would be forced to devalue the Pound in 1992 and fail to meet the conditions for the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This netted them more than a billion dollars in profit.Story continuesThe hedge fund investor has since retired from managing investor capital after he closed down his fund in 2010 stating that the job became too stressful. Currently, he invests in the stock market through his family office, which also leaves him insulated against large scale capital withdrawal from hedge funds during times of crisis in the stock market such as the one that took place last year and in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus breakout.However, even though he has chosen to step back from the lucrative world of hedge fund investing, Mr. Druckenmiller still has his fingers on the pulse of the industry. 2023's first half has been a stunner for industry observers and investors, as, despite an uncertain U.S. economic outlook and high interest rates, indexes such as the NASDAQ 100, have posted stunning gains that have touched 45%. Much of these have been due to the hype in artificial intelligence. Speaking at an event in June, he shared insightful thoughts about artificial intelligence and its prospects, particularly during a potential recession.According to him:All of AI is not going to make it through whether we have a recession or not because they haven't separated the wheat from the chaff yet. But I do believe, unlike crypto, I think AI is real, it's probably, it could be as transformative as the Internet, it's a huge thing. And I think I've argued publicly that if staples can go up in price in a recession, why can't a company like NVIDIA if they go up; if they go up if their orders and earnings go up 70% in a hard landing - which is what I think would probably happen. It's not clear that NVIDIA goes down despite the lofty valuation level. History has proved that if you do, that if you have very good earnings in a recession, and they're sustainable, if they're not the market somehow figures it out, those stocks would do just fine. So we have some longs, we have some shorts, and the AI's sort of dominated the long portfolio for five or six months.So, what are Stanley Druckenmiller's latest investments?

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders, since the share price is down 44% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 29%.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Verizon Communications actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 2.6% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.After considering the numbers, we'd posit that the the market had higher expectations of EPS growth, three years back. But it's possible a look at other metrics will be enlightening.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. Verizon Communications has maintained its top line over three years, so we doubt that has shareholders worried. A closer look at revenue and profit trends might yield insights.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Verizon Communications in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Verizon Communications, it has a TSR of -34% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Verizon Communications had a tough year, with a total loss of 20% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.7%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Verizon Communications is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

As noted in our press release, we achieved record EPS this fiscal year, reinforcing the power of brand building, consumer-centric strategies and disciplined execution. Importantly, we meaningfully advanced our strategic priorities, engaging with consumers around the world through product excellence, unique storytelling and distinctive omnichannel experiences. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and our data-rich consumer engagement platform, which underpin our growth agenda. I want to thank our talented global teams for continuing to drive our strong results. Touching on the strategic and financial highlights for the year. First, we powered global growth achieving 3% constant currency revenue gains consistent with our outlook and underscoring the benefits of our globally diversified business model. These top line results were led by our international businesses, which grew 13% excluding FX. This included a 5% increase in Greater China despite facing incremental COVID-related pressures in the first half of the year. Importantly, our business in China rebounded in the second half, achieving 50% growth in the fourth quarter supported by a strong improvement in traffic and representing an increase compared to the region's peak fiscal '21 levels. Our international results were also fueled by strong momentum in Other Asia with sales growth of 36% as well as in Japan, where revenue rose 15%. In Europe, sales increased 7% for the year. In North America, sales for the year declined low single digits against a challenging consumer backdrop. In the fourth quarter, our business decreased 8% versus last year, though we delivered significant gross margin improvement and handbag AUR growth, consistent with our commitments to prioritize long-term brand health. Importantly, our business in North America has improved meaningfully on a sequential basis quarter-to-date in Q1 with revenue trending in line with prior year on continued higher margins as we began to anniversary easier comparisons. Second, we continue to focus on building new and lasting customer relationships. To this end, we acquired approximately 6.5 million new customers in North America alone during the fiscal year. Importantly, these new customers transacted at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base and approximately half were Millennial and Gen Z consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered seamless omnichannel experiences, harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. We drove 3% growth in direct-to-consumer sales on a constant currency basis. This was led by mid-single-digit growth in brick-and-mortar sales as we welcome an increasing number of consumers to our stores. In addition, we maintained our strong positioning in digital. While sales were down slightly compared to the prior year, revenues still represented nearly 30% of sales, approximately 3x pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, we enhanced our capabilities this year, bringing all of our brands on a unified digital enterprise platform. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence informed by data analytics and consumer research. To this end, we drove handbag AUR growth globally and in North America for both the quarter and the year. We also delivered outsized top line gains in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, key to enhancing brand relevance and fueling customer value over time. Taken together, we generated record fiscal year earnings per share, increasing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year, which we accomplished despite a volatile demand backdrop and currency headwinds. This included a strong finish to our year with EPS growth of over 20% in the fourth quarter. Overall, our fiscal '23 results reinforce the meaningful progress we've made in differentiating our brands and our business. Further, our performance highlights our agility and the advantages of our model, underscoring our confidence in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Now turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. At the start of the year, we introduced our brand positioning of expressive luxury, laying the groundwork for deeper customer connections. Our team has brought this concept to life through impactful marketing campaigns, unique retail experiences and relevant and innovative product designs. As a result, the brand delivered revenue of nearly $5 billion on stronger operating margin, fueled by a material improvement in gross margin. Now touching on some of the details of the fourth quarter. We built on the momentum of our leather goods offering, reinforcing our icons to drive consumer engagement. We innovated across our key families, Tabby, Willow, Field and Rogue by introducing new iterations and launching strong go-to-market activations. Tabby outperformed expectations with notable success in our shoulder bag. Additionally, we have seen strong results from extensions of the family into small leather goods, including a wristlet and chain clutch, both of which over-indexed among younger customers. Willow continued to be a volume-driving style, while the Rogue family fueled stronger AUR aided by animations, including our Tea Rose. The introduction of Field tote and washed signature denim was a success, which bodes well for our various denim introductions in the year ahead. Our innovative product supported by data and consumer insights throughout the creation process, fueled a low double-digit gain in global handbag AUR at constant currency, including an increase in North America. Importantly, we see continued runway for pricing increases into fiscal year '24, given our commitment to expanding gross margin as well as benefits from outsized growth in higher AUR international markets. Next, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities, connecting emotionally with customers through the unique purpose of the brand. This spring in North America, we supported the important Mother's Day holiday with a two-pronged marketing approach. First, we led with content from Gen Z creators, highlighting Coach is a gifting destination. We followed this with an iconic Mother's Day campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. Overall, our marketing activities helped to support the acquisition of over 900,000 new customers in North America in the fourth quarter or approximately 3.9 million for the fiscal year. Turning to Greater China. We saw strong growth in brand momentum, delivering a 50% top line gain versus last year, excluding FX. In the quarter, we continued to recruit new customers with our product offering resonating with the younger consumers. This further supports our optimism for the future of this market. Moving to lifestyle. We drove a strong top line increase in the offering, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In ready-to-wear, we continue to see success, delivering mid-single-digit constant currency growth fueled by success in our branded denim options and T-shirt assortment. In men's, we delivered outsized growth driven by leather goods, including the successful launch of a cross grain leather program. At the same time, our Gotham, Charter and League families remained top sellers. And finally, we created omnichannel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand purpose, the courage to be real through self-expression. As such, we continued to roll out multisensory immersive concepts. This included the extension of In My Tabby activations with bespoke events and pop-ups across the globe. And in Malaysia, we launched Coach Airways, a full takeover of a retired airplane featuring our brand codes, a coach cafe and content creation opportunities throughout. Looking ahead to fiscal year '24, we're building on our success, focused on: first, deepening our connection with consumers, utilizing data to drive experiences that enrich a customers' life building a stronger long-term connection. Second, growing leather goods by animating our icons and Hero families, including the introduction of new sizes and hardware while continuing to focus on maintaining a productive assortment. Third, fueling gains across lifestyle by establishing more evergreen wardrobe essentials that align with the younger timeless Coach aesthetic. Fourth, leading with purpose-led storytelling through high-impact and sustained brand building campaigns, including the distortion of investments toward a younger generation, notably through digital innovation. And fifth, building momentum in our sub-brand Coachtopia with a focus on attracting a new Gen Z consumer. Coachtopia is off to a strong start, garnering significant consumer attention. While still a small portion of the assortment, it is tracking a year ahead of our original projections. In closing, Coach is just getting started. Our success is rooted in a blend of magic and logic, and we're building on our strong foundation with a clear strategy to deliver another year of growth in fiscal year '24. We are confident in the opportunity to deliver continued healthy growth for years to come. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the year, we advanced our strategic initiatives, navigating near-term external headwinds while keeping a sharp focus on our long-term objectives. We delivered revenue of $1.4 billion, in line with the prior year on a constant currency basis despite a more challenging backdrop in North America. To this end, we drove strong international growth, underscoring opportunity for the brand. Further, we expanded gross margin, a key element of our strategic and financial strategy and have delivered over 2 years of handbag AUR gains in keeping with our focus on elevating the brand. At the same time, we also made foundational investments in the brand that position us for the future. Having said that, we are clear-eyed about our path forward and the higher aspirations we have for the brand. We entered the current fiscal year front footed with focus and actions that build upon our progress and leverage the investments we've made to drive accelerated top and bottom line growth in fiscal year '24 and beyond. Turning to details of the fourth quarter. First, we remain focused on delivering an innovative and distinctive handbag offering. The Knott remains the top global handbag group, followed by the recently expanded Hudson family, which now includes options and whipstitched in straw. In addition, the iconic Sam bag, which was a pillar of the brand's 30th anniversary celebration, continued to deliver growth and resonated with both new and existing customers. As we move forward, we will further strengthen the brand's core handbag foundation. I'll touch on these strategies in a moment. Turning to novelty, which outperformed expectations as we bring heightened the motion to the brand. The Shell collection was a highlight of the fourth quarter, significantly outpacing expectations across categories. It drove engagement with younger consumers, resulting in strong full price sell-throughs and high margins. Overall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported low single-digit handbag AUR growth, both globally and in North America, demonstrating our commitment to brand building for the long term. Importantly, we achieved this against the North America backdrop that was more challenging than expected, resulting in conversion and traffic headwinds, notably in the brand's value channels. To navigate the external challenges, we moved quickly. We successfully accelerated new product launches helping to drive a material improvement in Q1 revenue trends, which are now roughly in line with last year. Next, we advanced our strategy to become more lifestyle with momentum in jewelry and footwear. We continue to see that customers who shop across categories are our highest value customers, demonstrating the importance of the brand's lifestyle offering as a long-term growth driver. In keeping with this strategy, we delivered an increase in average spend per customer in the quarter and the year. Now touching on marketing. We expressed the world of Kate Spade through unique storytelling and messaging connected to the brand's purpose and values, creating authentic consumer engagement. We invested in our brand codes globally, creating activations behind our Kate Spade Green and iconic dots and stripes, which are distinctive and key to driving brand awareness and global consistency. At the same time, we remain focused on women's empowerment through the lens of mental health, highlighted by our partnership with the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, which provides mental health services to women at HBCUs. Overall, our marketing helped to support the recruitment of approximately 500,000 new customers in North America for the quarter or approximately 2.4 million customers for the year. And finally, in keeping with our priority of becoming more global, we drove double-digit international gains at constant currency, underscoring the growth potential of the brand. Importantly, we fueled strong growth in China, where the brand has significant runway based on its relatively low awareness and small distribution footprint. At the same time, we launched marketing activations internationally, including pop-ups in Japan and Thailand as well as at Grand Gateway in Shanghai, which led us to securing a permanent location in that mall. We also continued the rollout of our new store concept, which began earlier in the year with the Marina Bay Sands store in Singapore, where we continue to outperform. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to more than 20 doors across the globe, creating a compelling brand experience. Now turning to our priorities at Kate Spade for fiscal '24 in keeping with our long-term strategies. First, we are focused on strengthening our core handbag foundation with a goal of developing more global key items building a strong branded signature platform and continuing to provide innovation that supports ongoing AUR growth. We're excited to launch our new Dakota handbag collection this fall, which features new hardware and will be the hero product story in our marketing campaigns. And this quarter, as mentioned, we accelerated the introduction of a new core collection in outlet, the Madison, which is driving an improvement in top line trends at accretive margins. Second, we'll continue to fuel the lifestyle offering led by growth in jewelry, which represents both a revenue and margin driver for the brand. Third, we'll invest in marketing to drive both acquisition and retention, continuing to build relationships with younger customers. Fourth, we will focus on the omnichannel opportunity by driving in-store productivity, including accelerating lifestyle and small leather goods. At the same time, we will leverage our recent investments in our digital platform with a focus on enhancing our online experiences. Finally, we will grow in China where the business is small, though seeing rapid increases. During the fiscal year, we expect to open a net of approximately 10 locations on the mainland. We will also invest in marketing to drive awareness, including through KOL partnerships. In closing, we remain focused on cultivating what makes the Kate Spade brand unique and special. To do this, we will continue to prioritize brand building and forging strong emotional bonds with our customers while executing on high-return initiatives that underpin our profitability goals. Importantly, we have a clear strategy and remain confident in the long-term opportunities for the brand. Turning to Stuart Weitzman. In the fiscal year, the brand was significantly impacted by the difficult external backdrop in China and North America. Improvement in the back half did not fully offset the impact of a slower China business in the first half. Despite these pressures, we focused on our long-term potential, maintaining brand health, which was underscored by gross margin expansion. Moving to the details of the fourth quarter. First, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product to spark desire. Our low first pumps and booties continue to perform in keeping with the broader consumer shift to casual and wear to work styles. Soho remained a top collection while we saw continued strength in the Stuart family of pumps. And our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment drove engagement with both new and existing clients at high AUR and accretive margins. And we fueled brand heat by leveraging new marketing tactics to increase awareness. We focused on creating relevant marketing, including partnerships with influential social media creators to deliver our spring campaign. Importantly, this helped to drive a favorable brand impression among millennials in the U.S. relative to last year per YouGov. Looking ahead to fiscal '24, we will increase marketing relevancy and drive brand consideration as we emotionally engage with our target consumers. Second, we will focus on driving growth in our core and iconic categories while adding depth to underpenetrated classifications that represent significant opportunity. This includes the launch of our extended sneaker assortment planned in the second quarter as well as expanded offering of flat, specifically trend-right valet styles. Third, we will accelerate growth in China, leveraging deep customer affinity to maximize the impact of our brand through product and marketing investments. Importantly, we expect to benefit from the recovery of this highly profitable region this fiscal year, which represented nearly 40% of the brand sales in fiscal year '21. And finally, we will fuel digital by leveraging Tapestry's platform to improve the online shopping experience and better engage with consumers. Overall, we're sharpening our focus on the consumer and are committed to driving top and bottom line growth in fiscal '24 and beyond. In closing, building on our strong foundation, we are focused on the future. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver revenue and profit gains across our current portfolio where our runway is significant. Further, last week, we were excited to announce the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings, establishing a new powerful global house of luxury and fashion brands that expands our portfolio reach across consumer segments, geographies and product categories. By bringing together 6 iconic brands with a heritage and design and craftsmanship and leveraging our modern consumer engagement platform, we will drive greater innovation, consumer connectivity and cultural relevance creating superior value for our consumers, employees, communities and shareholders around the world. We look forward to closing the transaction and sharing more detailed strategies for the future at the appropriate time. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott?Scott A. RoeThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, we clearly demonstrated our financial discipline and agility. We powered global growth, delivering a 3% increase at constant currency, fueled by international. We increased gross margin by 120 basis points, and we grew earnings per share by 12% versus last year while continuing to invest in marketing and digital capabilities. Importantly, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders, demonstrating our strong cash flow generation and confidence in the future. Turning to the details of the fourth quarter. I'll begin with a discussion of revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 1%, consistent with our guidance for low single-digit increase as 22% international growth was largely offset by pressure in North America given the difficult consumer backdrop. In Greater China, as anticipated, we delivered 50% revenue growth against last year's COVID impacted compare. This represented growth against our prior peak levels in 2021. And recently, we've seen an uptick in Chinese travel spend, specifically within Japan, Other Asia and Hong Kong and Macau and to a lesser extent, Europe. While these reads have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead. In Japan, sales rose 12%, while other Asia grew 7% with continued traction among local customers. Sales to tourists also improved versus the prior year, though remain below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, revenue declined 13% as we lapped last year's 50% gains. And in North America, sales declined 8% given softer consumer demand. Importantly, despite the difficult backdrop, we delivered gross margin gains across brands, underscoring our disciplined approach to pricing. As Joanne mentioned, we've seen a sequential improvement in revenue trends Q1 to date, with the business now performing in line with prior year as we've begun to anniversary easier compares. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 2%, fueled by a low single-digit gain in stores. And in wholesale, revenue was 5% below the prior year, reflecting growth in international markets, offset by a decline in North America, which included a strategic reduction in off-price shipments as well as overall wholesale market pressure. Moving down the P&amp;L, we delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 350 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 200 basis points of favorable freight expense, partially offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds. Excluding these impacts, gross margin was well ahead of last year, fueled by operational outperformance, reflecting net pricing improvements and a tailwind related to the increased penetration of the higher-margin China business. SG&amp;A rose 5%, in line with our expectations and including the anticipated timing shift of expenses from the third quarter into Q4, as previously discussed. We are continuing to reinvest in the business by prioritizing high-return initiatives, notably platform investments and brand-building activities to fuel long-term growth. Taken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of the prior year, and our fourth quarter EPS of $0.95 was in line with our guidance range, representing growth of 22%. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the year with $742 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.66 billion. Free cash flow for the year was an inflow of $791 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $261 million. Inventory levels at year-end were 8% below prior year, reflecting our focus on driving higher inventory turn while delivering stronger gross margins. Inventory levels were favorable to our expectations due in part to receipt timing with Q1 fiscal '24. Entering the new year, we are pleased with the quantity and quality of inventory across all brands and geographies. Moving to shareholder returns. As anticipated, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year which consisted of $700 million in share repurchases and dividend payments totaling $283 million for an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share, which represented a payout ratio of 30%. Before turning to our go-forward expectations, I want to touch on the recent exciting announcement outlining the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings. This acquisition positions us to create significant value for shareholders with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns. While our current focus remains on the existing business, we've hired Ernst &amp; Young to lead our integration efforts alongside a dedicated internal team ahead of the estimated transaction close in calendar 2024. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue to approach $6.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately 3% to 4% on both the reported and constant currency basis. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we anticipate slight growth for the fiscal year. This forecast reflects our commitment to maintaining promotional discipline and higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term. In Greater China, our outlook contemplates high single-digit growth, including outside strength in the first half as we lapped last year's COVID-related headwinds. In Japan, we expect to grow high single digits, while other Asia is forecasted to increase at a high-teens rate. And in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth. In addition, our outlook includes a modest improvement in operating margin versus last year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase, which includes a benefit from moderated freight costs with the most notable tailwind coming in the first quarter. On SG&amp;A expenses, we anticipate slight deleverage for the year, reflecting continued investments in growth driving initiatives across the portfolio. In light of the current environment, we're continuing to monitor our cost base and take proactive actions where needed. Moving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 235 million shares. Taken together, we project EPS of $4.10 to $4.15 representing 6% to 7% growth versus last year. This takes into account our decision to suspend share repurchase activity due to the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings resulting in a $0.10 headwind versus our prior expectations. Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we would expect free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we forecast CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $220 million. We expect over half of this spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia. The balance of the spend is primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching now on the shaping of the year, we expect relatively consistent top line growth between the first and second half of the year. As mentioned, we see the opportunity for gross margin expansion for the year, with the most significant improvement in Q1, benefiting from lower freight expense versus the prior year. SG&amp;A growth is expected to be higher in the first half relative to the second half based on the pace of investments. Taken together, while we expect operating income growth to be relatively balanced between the halves, we would anticipate EPS growth to be front-half weighted, primarily due to the phasing of our share count and tax rate assumptions. This contemplates first quarter earnings per share to approach $0.90, representing a low double-digit growth rate. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are consistent with those shared in our acquisition announcement last week. First, we will continue to invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. We've also initiated a long-term leverage target of under 2.5x on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the transaction close. Finally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. As previously announced, we anticipate dividend payments of $325 million in fiscal '24, reflecting a 17% increase to our dividend per share to $0.35 for an annual rate of $1.40. Importantly, we believe the strong cash flow profile of the combined company provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. To this end, following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. In closing, we delivered strong fiscal '23 results, highlighted by revenue gains at constant currency significant gross margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth despite a rapidly shifting backdrop. This marked record EPS for the company, underscoring our agility and the consistent execution of the global teams. We remain focused on staying disciplined to deliver against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns. I'd now like to open it up for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.Robert Scott DrbulI was just wondering -- congrats on a good quarter. Can you talk a little more around what you really learned from Coach's success over the years? And how can you apply that to all the brands, I think, particularly as you expand the portfolio with this planned acquisition?Joanne C. CrevoiseratThanks, Bob, and good morning. We are closing out the year with record earnings per share, and we're operating from a position of strength. And I think what our results show is the power of our brands and the power of our business model. And we do see this acquisition is compelling. And we do also have a lot of learnings that we can apply from Coach's success over the last few years. And there are 3 or 4 things, I think, that come top of mind as I think about your question. First, and probably most importantly, we've clarified our brand positioning. We've done that across our portfolio and really clarifying the unique position within the market for each of our brands. And as we've done that, we've crystallized our target customer and really getting to know these customers on a deeper level, fielding a lot of research, ethnographic research, quantitative, qualitative, that and those insights have driven the acquisition of new and younger customers. We talked about it in our prepared remarks, half of our acquisitions in the last year being new and younger -- of our new customers were young Millennial and Gen Z consumers. I think second, we strengthened our teams and ways of working, and I talk about this, but it's about applying data and analytics and consumer insights in the business, putting it in the hands of decision-makers so that it influences action, and that's how we deliver results behind those capabilities. And third, they're all important, but maybe most importantly, we're investing in brand building activities. That includes doubling our marketing spend over the last few years and the capabilities to meet the consumer where they are. We have a strong direct-to-consumer platform. We continue to invest in that. And we have -- it starts with a productive and profitable store fleet, and we don't talk a lot about this, but our store fleet today is more profitable than it was pre-pandemic. In addition, we've created capabilities to meet consumers in digital and social channels that is increasingly important, and we've tripled our digital business versus pre-pandemic levels. And we supported all of this with disciplined operating principles and disciplined inventory management. So -- that's what's driving our business. It's working, and our progress is reflected. You can see that increases in AUR, increases in gross margin that we're seeing across our brands and they've enabled us to consistently deliver strong results in the face of a volatile environment. Coach is a great example I'm going to steal a little thunder from Todd, is a great example of the power of these strategies. In fiscal '24, Coach is tracking to achieve its highest annual sales and earnings in its history, and we see tremendous runway ahead for that brand. So overall, we're excited about the opportunities we see in our current portfolio and with the potential of this acquisition.OperatorYour next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonCan you help us diagnose the North America sales weakness in the quarter and what drove the shortfall versus plan. Was it more pronounced in outlet versus full price? Was it a product category? And then after that, can you just talk a little bit about what caused the improvement quarter-to-date?Joanne C. CrevoiseratPerfect. I would cover both of those together, Lorraine, thank you for the question. North America, the environment is challenging. The aspirational consumer, it's -- particularly the lower income cohort is under pressure on a relative basis and being more choiceful. We see that in our conversion results. Importantly, though, we entered the quarter with our eyes open on some of the challenges in North America with an intention on continuing to drive our business in a healthy way. And you can see that we continue to grow AUR and expanded gross margin, and we were disciplined as we managed through it. And what we're seeing with this more considered purchase in North America is that innovation is what's driving engagement. And we know that, that bar is high for the consumer. In terms of your question in terms of what's changing it, we're focused on brand building, delivering product excellence and great execution, including with strong inventory management. And what's changed the trend and it's changed pretty dramatically in the first quarter, we see an improvement. I think, number one, we're up against easier compares from a year ago, but we've also accelerated newness. As we -- being a direct-to-consumer model, we see the trends happening and we understand what consumers are responding to. And we've leveraged our agile supply chain to pull forward newness, and that's had a big impact on our results. As we've talked about in the first quarter, quarter-to-date, our business running roughly in line with last year. So we've seen a nice turnaround there. And we're continuing to focus on driving a healthy business staying close to our consumer and delivering that great product that the consumer continues to respond to.Scott A. RoeAnd Lorraine, this is Scott. Maybe just to build on how that translates into the numbers too. We've given guidance for North America to be up slightly through the year, but really that trend that Joanne just mentioned that we're seeing right now is what's reflected in the first quarter, again, against an easier comp, it distorts the year-on-year percentages a little bit. When we look at the balance of the year, it is very balanced, right? First half, second half. And we've taken that trend on a go-forward basis in our assumptions. It's not heroic. It really reflects what we see on the ground right now and the trends that we see.OperatorYour next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Joanne, with the improvement in North America, how would you assess the overall health of the handbag and accessories category globally today? Or maybe how best to break down your 3% to 4% revenue guidance between AUR and units? And then, Scott, excluding the pause in share buyback associated with the transaction, I guess, has anything changed with your underlying plan for $5 earnings in FY '25? And can you speak to the free cash flow profile post integration and just the opportunity that this provides multiyear?Joanne C. CrevoiseratSo thanks, Matt. I'll pick up the first part of that question in terms of the handbag category. This is an incredibly resilient and durable category. And we're seeing it again as we go through incredibly choppy demand environment around the world, the consumer continues to engage with this category in a very strong way. And it has a -- the category has proven to be durable through downturns, resilient and coming out of downturns. And the challenges that we faced over the last 3 years have really helped us to navigate different headwinds in different regions of the world. So as I look at our business, and the consumer response to the category, we're seeing really strong growth in our international businesses, even while the business in North America may be relatively challenged. And as we look forward, our outlook is for growth in every region in fiscal '24, slight growth in North America, but a continuation of the strong trends we see in international markets and our business is positioned to take advantage of those trends, both regionally and by channel, wherever the customer chooses to shop, we're in a great position to take advantage of those trends. And these are trends we're seeing today when a lot of the tourism business that maybe we have relied on in the past has been a bigger part of the business. We're driving this business with more local consumers, and we expect over time that tourism to rebound and that will be an added benefit to our business. So a strong and durable category, and we're well positioned to capitalize on that going forward.Scott A. RoeAnd that's the perfect build, Matt, on your question around how we see the $5. The business has momentum, we're coming from a position of strength and there's no change in the fundamental outlook that led us to talk about our confidence in hitting the $5. As you rightly pointed out, the pause in share repurchase does impact EPS, but not operating earnings in terms of those assumptions, right? So if you think about that impact, there's 2 factors. We don't buy back as many shares. So the average share count is obviously going to be higher than previously assumed. On the other hand, we're accumulating cash, right? And that cash will be available at closing to help pay down debt. In the meantime, it's going to earn interest. So the net of those 2 things on a cumulative basis are about $0.35, and we've previously already said, I think, in the press release, that's about $0.10 in fiscal '24. And then you asked about free cash flow. That's the exciting part sitting as a CFO here. When I look at the potential of this transaction, first of all, just a couple of data points that maybe ground everybody, there's about $1 billion in cumulatively, if you just add up the 2 companies today and the generation of cash flow right now at this point is in excess of $1.5 billion per year, right? And we've said that when you consider synergies and growth over time, that number exceeds $2 billion on an annual basis. So $2 billion of free cash flow focused really acutely in the short term on paying down debt. And then over time, the optionality that, that gives us from a capital allocation is I think, a difference making as you think about this as a combined company in the future.OperatorYour next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachI was hoping you could talk a bit more about the drivers of the positive handbag AUR that you saw in the quarter and your outlook for additional ticket and AUR increases as you move into FY '25? How are you planning for AUR growth, in particular, pricing growth in North America against what we perceive to be a slightly more promotional competitive industry backdrop?Joanne C. CrevoiseratWell, I'll kick it off and then toss it to Todd to give you some real color on how that's happening at Coach and continuing to happen year after year. we are driving handbag AUR growth, not only in Coach, Kate Spade delivering 2 years of AUR growth as well. And it comes from really understanding our consumer, leveraging data across our value chain, all of the capabilities that we've built over the last few years and embedded in our decision-making in terms of our assortment size, our assortment architecture, cutting off the tail, our inventory management capabilities. All of those capabilities, our teams have embraced. Ways of working here are critically important to make sure that those capabilities end up in the hands of decision-makers and they drive action. And I'd be remiss if I did talk about the fact that when we get to know our customers better, that gives our creative teams an opportunity to deliver that incredible creativity in a powerful way that resonates with our target consumers. So it's that balance of magic and logic. And with that, I will pass it to Todd, and he can give you some examples of how that comes to life at Coach.Todd KahnThank you, Joanne. And I said this before, innovation creates desire. And we have created a desire not just in the product, but the way we present the product. Joanne has talked a lot about how we use our Tapestry platform to inform our understanding of our customer. And we do this with coupled with the idea of expressive luxury. So when we look at expressive luxury, we talk about the actual product. We talk about the place, what's the environment we put it in. If you saw this year, we created so much innovation with the Tabby pop-ups globally, that created excitement. And so I'm very confident that the storytelling that we've really led with this purpose-led storytelling. We started last year with Lil Nas. We moved into connecting the product and the storytelling together with our Tabby campaign, which has drove incredible desire for Tabby. So I feel very good about our continuing AUR both in North America and globally. We'll see low to mid-single digits there. And we're doing it on both sides of the equation. We've raised the floor over the last couple of years, our consumers are coming into the brand at higher price points. We're extraordinarily focused on that $300 to $500 price range. And that has created even greater white space between us and European luxury. So for us, the desire of our product, the innovation we're bringing, the storytelling around it, all under the umbrella of express of luxury is working, and I believe will continue to work.OperatorYour next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerJust first, with respect to Kate Spade, I think you said you saw more pressure in the value channel. Was AUR up at Kate adjusted for what may have been a mix shift to retail from outlet? And then with respect to the acceleration in product launches early in Q1 here. What's your level of confidence that the acceleration in the revenue trend can be sustained? It sounds like there may be a bit of pull forward here to the extent you pushed up product releases? And then separately for Scott, just with freight, how much break recapture opportunity is left at this stage? Just if you could quantify that for us, would be helpful.Joanne C. CrevoiseratYes. Thanks for your question, Mark. We did drive handbag AUR increases at Cape in North America. So it was not mix benefited. And it's based on deliberate strategies. We are not chasing every last dollar of top line in our business. We're protecting brand health, and we see a lot of runway ahead at Kate, both top line growth and in margin and AUR growth. They're a little bit earlier on the journey, although now we've got 2 years of consistent AUR increases under our belt. So we feel good about our ability to continue to drive AUR increases based on brand positioning. And that's the result of -- our disciplined operations are leveraging our platform with data and analytics and applying that to the business, but also driving innovation. And we're incredibly focused at Kate Spade at driving innovation and -- the big change that we saw was delivery -- faster delivery of that newness and innovation, particularly in the outlet channel with the Madison delivery, and that's not a one-off. This is a focus of ours as we get to know our core customer. We continue to innovate on product and experiences with the brand and those launches are working. We have more in store for fiscal '24. We talked about the launches of our Dakota bag coming this fall, and other changes that we're making in the business that are having an impact. So we feel we're clear-eyed about the opportunity at Kate. We are accelerating the pace of innovation to accelerate our progress, and we feel good about the product that we have in the pipeline to continue to drive that trend as we move forward.Scott A. RoeYes. And so, as you think about the pace of the year or 2, just maybe a little more on that. So first of all, we'll see a significant sequential improvement in Kate in the first quarter. I don't know if we said that already. But just like we do in the overall business. So while that's certainly positive news, and we -- and Joanne already said, we're tracking quarter-to-date, very much in line with that. Also remember, the comps get a little squirrely between the quarters here. And when we look at a multiyear stack in Q1 and really the balance of the year in our guided outlook. It's a fairly consistent theme with international being relatively stronger in the first half. Again, comps being a lot of the driver of this and then a little more in North America in the back half. But when you zoom out a couple of clicks and just look at the trajectory, this is very much the current pace of business being projected in our outlook going forward. And again, I would just repeat, it's not heroic in the way we've done it, and it's very balanced. It's not back half loaded. It's very consistent in terms of the way we guided. You had a specific question on freight. We didn't identify it. I would tell you, freight is largely behind us now. The 1 quarter where we're going to see a benefit is Q1. And if you recall, from years past, that's when we started seeing the big freight and then we had 1 quarter where we were still down last year in gross margin because of freight. So we'll get that benefit on a year-on-year basis in Q1. But for the balance of the year, it's a much more moderate benefit as we look forward. So less than a full point as we look at this year.OperatorYour next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about this upcoming year in this upcoming fiscal year, and improvement in China that you've seen, how are you planning for Asia and China? And how are you thinking about Europe go forward? And in particular, on the channel distribution, any unpacking of what you're seeing in wholesale and how that's differing from the retail performance?Joanne C. CrevoiseratYes. So let me start with China. Our categories and our brands are resonating with Chinese consumers. We drove 50% growth at constant currency in the market in the last quarter. And I know that the last year number was COVID disrupted, but that was an increase to our prior peak at constant currency. So we're seeing a consistently strong business in China the consumer continuing to value what we represent in the market. And our teams in China are doing an excellent job building our brands and connecting with consumers. As you know, we've been in that market for 2 decades, building brands, understanding the landscape and we've been agile to be able to pivot with the consumer and deliver in a way that they continue to respond to. As we look forward, we see an opportunity for continued performance in China. We talked about our guide high single-digit growth for this year. And just to frame it, it continues to expect that growth to our prior peak. So we do expect gradual recovery in China continuing throughout the year and as Scott mentioned, it's based on what we're seeing and the trends we see in the market today. So we expect a continuation. To your point, we're seeing tremendous opportunity as well in other Asia. And that's a part Japan and the rest of Asia is a part of the market that is now almost equal to China in terms of size, and it is also growing fast. We expect high single-digit growth in that region as well as in Europe. And in those markets, we're increasingly engaging the local domestic consumer base. And that's what's been driving, if you can think about it over the last 3 years, that's what's been driving our business. We also expect that there'll be some benefit of tourism as tourism recovers. We're seeing some of that today, mostly in Asia, a little bit in Europe, but not as much in the West at this point. We're not counting on that in our outlook. Again, we're taking the trends that we're seeing in the business, and we're projecting those forward and we think a prudent way. But our international business is strong, and our teams on the ground are engaging consumers in effective ways and the consumer is responding to the product and experiences which we're delivering.Todd KahnAnd Dana, I'll just add on the wholesale, if you take Europe, we're really growing our wholesale business in Europe in a very productive way. I feel very good about that. And that benefits from a local consumer Joanne said, but as we see China opening up more, there will be more -- if there is an inbound of PRC in the rest of Asia and in Europe, that will benefit us. And then in North America, again, Coach is 96% direct-to-consumer. So we have a much greater connectivity to our client in that area. In fact that -- we always believe in the wholesale channel. We want to win in that channel. We'd love to see many of our wholesale partners create higher service levels in those channels that will enable us to do that, and we're working with them on that. So overall, we feel good about our positioning. We feel good about controlling our own destiny but there is tremendous opportunity. And I will say not just in handbags, but for the Coach brand, we see further opportunities with footwear, particularly in wholesale.Scott A. RoeAnd. Let me jump in here -- sorry, Dana. I'm just going to jump in. I was looking through my notes, and I don't think we fully answered 1 of the questions that Mark laid out. And I just wanted to get it out there for the group. It was specific on what we saw in AUR at Kate Spade. And we grew AUR across both retail and outlet in the fourth quarter in Kate Spade. So that focus on quality. And while we're not chasing the last dollar focus on fundamental and long-term brand health, that was evident in the quarter that we just reported. So I just wanted to get that out there.OperatorYour next question is from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver ChenAs we look forward to holiday. What are your thoughts in terms of the inventory as well as planning around gifting and also you [better] on a great journey to make the inventory breadth more efficient. And a follow-up question, would love you to talk to us a little bit about the approval process or major hurdles or catalysts ahead. And also, how you thought about the differences and the opportunity of the Michael Kors brand given that you have so much research -- consumer research there. We're looking at cross-product elasticity and diversion ratios, just to understand the relationships between the 2 brands and the big opportunity, financial and strategic?Joanne C. CrevoiseratWell, maybe I'll pass it to Todd first to talk about how we're excited about holiday. We are in a great position, to your point, on inventory. Our inventory is down 8% versus last year, actually a better position than we were expecting coming out of the year. So that puts us in -- it gives us a great opportunity to ensure we have the right product at the right time for consumers. Todd, do you want to put a little color on that?Todd KahnYes. Oliver, and I kind of was hoping you asked me a Coachtopia question. But we feel very good about holiday. You're going to see clarity of products, building on our really significant platforms with Tabby. We're going to be launching starting in the fall, which will lead into holiday, and I won't give too much away on the holiday campaign. But our Shine campaign, which, again, is a further extension of connecting product with perfect. We feel very, very good about that. We feel like we done a good job, but there's always room to improve on the animation of both the product and how we look at holiday. So I'm very excited for the holiday quarter. I think both in brick-and-mortar offerings as well as our digital offerings. And I will say, even though you didn't ask me, we are very excited about where we are with Coachtopia and Joanne said, while still relatively small at the year ahead of where we thought we would be, more importantly, I'll quote Scott here. It's hitting above its weight class in terms of being a driver of younger consumers creating interest in the brand. So you'll see Coachtopia play really a significant factor as we start expanding the product offering and start putting it in more doors right around that holiday gift-giving period. So we'll have something for everyone at Coach, and I know the same is true at our sister brand.Joanne C. CrevoiseratThanks, Todd. That is true. And I'll hit on the regulatory questions and the Michael Kors question briefly because I know we're running over time. But just in short, we're confident in our ability to complete this transaction. This is a transaction. It is highly complementary. It expands our portfolio reach and diversification. And to your point, Oliver, we fielded a lot of research coming into this transaction. We know that the portfolio at Capri includes -- and including Michael Kors, they're strong brands and they're well positioned in attractive markets and market segments. We're excited about the opportunity that we see working together putting these brands on our platform. They're distinctive and have unique positioning in the market, which is why they are so attractive to us. And that does include the Kors brand, putting that -- all of the brands on our platform allows us to take these iconic brands with heritage put them on our consumer engagement platform to drive more innovation, more connectivity and really more relevance for the consumer which will benefit all of our stakeholders around the world. So we're excited about the opportunities ahead.OperatorThank you. That concludes our Q&amp;A. I will now turn it over to Joanne for some concluding remarks.Joanne C. CrevoiseratWell, thank you for joining us today and for your interest in our story, and thank you to our exceptional teams around the world. We're pleased to report record earnings per share in fiscal '23 and to share our expectations for the continued top and bottom line growth we see for fiscal '24. We're in a position of strength, and we're laser-focused on our current business where we have significant runway. Building on this foundation last week, we were excited to announce the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings. We have strong conviction that this combination positions us for an even brighter future, accelerating our strategic agenda and driving enhanced cash flow and financial returns. We see a compelling opportunity to deliver superior value for all stakeholders, and I look forward to engaging with you in the days ahead. Thanks, and have a great day.OperatorThis concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.]"

For the full year, Stuart Weitzman reported a net sales decline of 11 percent to $281.6 million, down from $317.7 million in 2022.More from Footwear NewsTapestry Has Slight Stumble in Q4 as North American Sales SagWalmart Raises Outlook As Value Message ResonatesCompanywide, Tapestry posted net sales of $1.62 billion for the fourth quarter, in line with the same time period last year. For the full fiscal year, Tapestry recorded net sales of $6.66 million, down from $6.68 million in 2022. The numbers come a week after the company struck a deal to acquire Capri in a deal valuing the business at $8.5 billion.Today’s results sparked concern for some analysts. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in his note to clients that Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade were “going backward” at Tapestry while Coach is “chugging along nicely.”“It does not help that both brands are more exposed to the challenged North American market,” Saunders said. “Their exposure to categories where there is more cutting back is also unhelpful.”The analyst went on to state that the Weitzman’s assortment “went off the boil” during the quarter and some of the new releases “did not inspire” the consumer in the way previous seasons have done. “Despite some interesting collections earlier in the year, such as the collaboration with KidSuper – products were a little timid and easily overlooked,” Saunders said.On the company’s earnings call on Thursday, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told analysts that the shoe brand was “significantly” impacted by the difficult external backdrop in China and North America, which have been weak spots for many companies. “Improvement in the back half did not fully offset the impact of a slower China business in the first half,” Crevoiserat said. “Despite these pressures, we focused on our long-term potential, maintaining brand health, which was underscored by gross margin expansion.”Story continuesAs for highlights in the quarter, the CEO said that Stuart Weitzman’s low pumps and booties continued to perform well in keeping with the broader consumer shift to casual and wear to work styles. Specifically, Crevoiserat noted the brand’s SoHo and Stuart collections as its top footwear performers in Q4.Looking ahead to fiscal 2024, Crevoiserat told analysts on today’s call that the company is focusing on driving growth in Stuart Weitzman’s core and iconic categories while adding depth to underpenetrated classifications that represent significant opportunity. This includes the launch of an extended sneaker assortment planned in the second quarter as well as expanded offering of flats, specifically trend-right ballet styles.The CEO also said that Tapestry plans to accelerate the brand’s growth in China and expects to benefit from the recovery of this “highly profitable region” this fiscal year, which represented nearly 40 percent of the brand sales in fiscal year 2021.“Building on our strong foundation, we are focused on the future,” Crevoiserat added. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver revenue and profit gains across our current portfolio where our runway is significant.”Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

Here to discuss we have Bernstein Senior Analyst Aneesha Sherman. Aneesha, thanks so much for joining us. So when you think about these retailers who have reported-- we have Walmart, The Target, we had TJX, what stands out to you as the trends that we are seeing this time around?ANEESHA SHERMAN: It is a continuation of the trend that we saw last quarter, which is that, on top of 2022 super strong consumer demand, the consumer this year has been much more cautious, looking for deals, looking to trade down, looking to buy lower priced items within category, and to buy smaller baskets. And we're seeing that trend impact Walmart. Walmart is leaning into it and pricing better.Story continuesWe're seeing it in TJX, where TJX had average baskets slightly down, average ticket slightly down, but got the comp out of traffic because people are switching out of department stores and shopping at a Marmaxx-- a Marshalls, or TJ Maxx to get better value. So it is definitely the value-seeking behavior that has been consistently the trend across this week's retail results, and I expect that to continue with Ross tonight.- Yeah, Aneesha, when you take a look at Walmart's numbers here, just foot traffic up 2.8%. They also posted a higher ticket up 3.4% online sales, also on the rise for the quarter. When you talk about this trend, it's a continuation of what we've seen since the start of the year. Is this a trend that you see sticking through the end of the year?ANEESHA SHERMAN: I think so, yeah. I mean, Last year the lower income consumer was more pressured, but this year we've seen the cumulative effects of inflation and high rates impact not just low income, but middle income and slightly more premium consumers as well. So we're not just seeing it at those low tiers, we're seeing it across the economy, and we're seeing it across segments of retail as well, from discount all the way up to premium and accessible luxury. So I do expect it to continue for a little while longer.- And so Aneesha, when do you think this pattern breaks out? Because I remember seeing a cycle like this before. The last time around where I saw this trade down when you were thinking of even the higher income shopper going to-- switching and converting to TJ Maxx, The Marmaxx brands, was the Great Recession. I don't know if you're old enough to have been around then covering it. (LAUGHING) But want to ask is, do we see any kind of trend shifting away from that before the year is out, especially when you consider this back half of the year? It's such a crucial time for retailers.ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah. So the dynamics during the GFC were that, it was the big trade down event that actually really helped TJX and Ross. 2009 was one of the best years for TJX and Ross because we saw a huge amount of trade down. The big difference is, that was a sharp shock. Huge amount of consumers lost their jobs. They had to immediately shift their spending habits, and we had some really negative comps across retail.This time around it's been more slow. Unemployment still remains really low. People still have jobs. But it's inflation that's creeping up. And so the trade down has been more gradual. We've seen it happen over-- this is a third quarter now where we've seen traffic at these discount retailers up and traffic at the mainstream retailers down. And so that share shift is happening more slowly. It's not ripping off a Band-Aid. It's going to be a slow burn for the next couple of quarters.- So Aneesha, let's talk about the other end of the spectrum when we take a look at the luxury consumer. Tapestry was out with its results. Disappointing year. US demand clearly waning a bit, at least when you take a look at these numbers. Before we talk about their acquisition last week, what can you-- is this a start of a trend just in terms of weakness that we're seeing in luxury here in the US? And is that maybe indicative of what we could see overseas?ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah. These companies, these accessible luxury companies, as well as high luxury companies had a phenomenal year last year. They had limited supply. The consumer was out and about for the first time post COVID, and was eager to buy accessories, and ready-to-wear, and shoes for going back to weddings, and going on trips, and going back to work, and so on. So we had this huge wave of pent-up demand.And Tapestry's North America number was 26% growth last year, and this year it's about flat. So part of it is just lapping a very strong year. But beyond that, it's also indicative of this broader trend that we've been talking about. The consumer is getting more value-seeking, not interested in buying as many discretionary items, and is looking to do some trade down. So we've seen some of this flagging consumer demand across the luxury sector as well as further down the premium as well as mainstream retail.- Aneesha, I got to ask you, what do you make of that deal of Tapestry and Capri, especially when you think about that point about the direction that you've seen some of Tapestry brands go. I've seen more coach bags than I could remember in-- I never used to see them in TJ Maxx. I've seen a bunch of them now. And when you think about them purchasing-- I mean, we've seen cause in decline. Does this even make sense from your point of view?ANEESHA SHERMAN: Short-term, it deteriorates the quality of the Tapestry portfolio because the company they're buying is a slower growth, lower margin company. They're levering up to do it so it deteriorates their balance sheet. They're pausing their buybacks so it takes a few off their earnings growth for the next couple of years. So on all metrics, it's a lower quality company now and is valued it should be valued at a lower multiple.However, long-term rationale makes sense, which is basically that, they are trying to gain scale in the luxury market. To run a direct to consumer luxury brand, you need a lot of scale. You need to invest in brand building, and marketing, and real estate, and flagship stores, and events, and you can do that much better when you have better firepower in terms of higher cash flows, higher marketing budget, and that's a lot easier to do when you are a $12 to $15 billion brand than when you're a 6 to $7 billion brand. So that is the long term rationale, which I think makes sense. But short-term, it does deteriorate the quality of the company.- Aneesha, do you see Tapestry after acquiring Capri-- is it going to be a real competitor to some of the larger players, the leaders in this space when you take a look at LVMH and also Kering? I don't think we're going to see it replace LVMH or Kering any time soon. However, I think it will start to access the lower end of that demand. So accessible luxury band within a Kering, or within some of these other high luxury brands, is what they're looking for.They're not looking to be the next Chanel. I don't think that's feasible. I think they're looking to take a step up. And in order to do that, they need to attract a different consumer, a higher end consumer, and they need this kind of marketing brand building ability to do that, and they need the scale for that to work. So it does make sense. I don't think it's going to end up being a high luxury brand any time soon, but I think it's going to take a step up from where it is now.- Well, we're certainly seeing them build the scale. We'll see if they build up the luxury cachet that they're trying to go for. Aneesha Sherman, thank you so much.]"

TPR reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands witnessed year-over-year growth in earnings per share while sales remained in line. The company recently unveiled plans to acquire Capri Holdings for nearly $8.5 billion or $57.00 per share. The deal, which is likely to conclude in the next calendar year, will unite the six distinctive iconic brands into a powerful global house of luxury portfolio.We note that shares of this New York-based company have lost 22.2% in the past three months against the industry’s 6.2% rise.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureTapestry posted fourth-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 96 cents per share. However, the metric grew more than 20% from the year-ago period.Net sales came in at $1,619.5 million, missing the consensus estimate of $1,667 million. The metric remained flat year over year. On a constant-currency basis, the top line inched up 1%, excluding an FX headwind of about 180 basis points (bps).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s Delve DeeperFor the fiscal fourth quarter, net sales for Coach came in at $1,247.4 million, up 3% year over year. Kate Spade’s sales came in at $309.5 million, down 10% from the year-ago period. Net sales for Stuart Weitzman totaled $62.6 million, reflecting a decrease of 13% year over year.International sales grew 22% at constant currency, including +50% in Greater China, +12% in Japan and +7% in Other Asia, while the metric in Europe fell 13% year over year.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company realized 2% growth in direct-to-consumer sales at constant currency, with a low-single-digit increase in stores.Margin DiscussionThe consolidated gross profit came in at $1,172.7 million, up 4.8% from the year-ago period. Also, the gross margin increased 350 bps to 72.4%, gaining from operational efficiency and lower freight expenses. This was somewhat offset by an FX headwind of about 80 bps.Further, the company reported an operating income of $273.6 million, up from an adjusted operating income of $260 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the operating margin came in at 16.9%, expanding 90 bps from the year-ago period. This increase was driven by disciplined expense management and gross margin gains. However, the metric was partially hurt by an FX headwind of approximately 100 bps.Story continuesStore UpdateAt the end of the quarter, Tapestry operated 330 Coach stores, 205 Kate Spade outlets and 36 Stuart Weitzman stores in North America. Internationally, the count was 609, 192 and 57 for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, respectively.Other Financial DetailsTapestry ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $742 million, long-term debt of $1,635.8 million and stockholders' equity of $2,277.8 million.The company generated net cash of $975.2 million during the fiscal year and free cash flow was an inflow of $791 million. The company incurred capital expenditures and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $261 million in the aforementioned period.Tapestry returned $1 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends during fiscal 2023. The company repurchased $700 million in common stock or roughly 17.8 million shares at an average cost of $39.30 a share. The company’s board also approved the return of $283 million to shareholders in fiscal 2023 for an annual rate of $1.20 a share. This rate shows a year-over-year increase and represents a dividend payout ratio of 30%.For fiscal 2024, the company’s board has approved a quarterly cash dividend of 35 cents per share, reflecting a hike of 17% versus the last year and annual dividend rate of $1.40 a share.Fiscal 2023In fiscal 2023, the company achieved International revenue increase of 13% at constant currency, with increases across all the major markets. This includes growth of more than 36% in Other Asia, 15% in Japan, 7% in Europe and 5% in Greater China in spite of the first-half pandemic-related pressures.Tapestry saw a 2% revenue decrease in North America during the fiscal year and an 8% fall in the fourth quarter despite the sluggish consumer demand environment. However, there has been a sequential improvement in the revenue trends in first quarter to date in fiscal 2024.The company’s direct-to-consumer revenues grew 3% at constant currency for the fiscal year, driven by a mid-single-digit rise in stores. Further, the company recorded double-digit earnings per share growth in the fiscal year and generated solid free cash flow.OutlookFor fiscal 2024, Tapestry envisions revenues to be roughly $6.9 billion, reflecting a rise of approximately 3-4% year over year on both a reported and constant currency basis. Net interest expenses are anticipated to be nearly $20 million while tax rate is likely to be approximately 20%.As earlier announced, the company has suspended its share buyback program, ahead of the pending acquisition of Capri Holdings, until it reaches a leverage target of under 2.5x on a gross debt/EBITDA basis.Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be $4.10-$4.15, representing nearly 6-7% growth from the prior year. This included the suspending share repurchase impacts, which reflects a negative impact of 10 cents, compared with the prior expectations.This guidance assumes no revenue or earnings contribution from the proposed acquisition of Capri Holdings, gradual recovery in Greater China, and no worsening of inflationary pressures or consumer confidence.Key PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, Boot Barn BOOT and American Eagle Outfitters AEO.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a leading casual apparel retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Julie Hyman check out Tapestry's stock value while examining the impact its acquisition of Capri Holdings (CPRI) could have on its consumer base.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Got to get to Tapestry as we continue on this retail theme. Those shares aren't doing a heck of a lot. The Coach parent company gave a weaker than expected guidance. Saw sales at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman fall from a year ago. This report coming, of course, after Tapestry announced the purchase of rival Capri Holdings in an $8.5 billion deal. That happening just last week.So it's interesting to see the shares little changed here. If you look at the numbers, the company's forecast for the full year, its fiscal 2024, is at most $4.15. Analysts had been looking for $4.22. Revenue likewise coming in a bit short of estimates if you look at the forecast. I haven't had a chance to take a look at headlines from the call, but it's possible that commentary they made is helping the shares from decreasing on what looks like sort of lackluster numbers here.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. I mean, it comes just after a key acquisition to tie up, especially in that luxury landscape between Tapestry and Capri. And you got to think going forward here for investors that have already seen the acquisitive nature that this formula of Tapestry and really bringing in together several brands under its helm. That many years ago between the Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade and Coach kind of combination that they were able to make then.And now adding on even more of those kind of high value, high cost type of names and brands into their portfolio. Or what they're saying about that, they had talked a little bit about that just particularly in the press release, saying that they're establishing a new global powerhouse of luxury and fashion brands that expands their portfolio across consumer segments, geographies, and product categories.Story continuesStill, a question lingers, perhaps, of whether or not they overpaid for that acquisition as well. A considerable premium to what the market valuation was for Capri.JULIE HYMAN: Although Simeon Siegel, who we talked to at BMO Capital Markets, said it's a depressed valuation coming into that offer. So nonetheless, the Tapestry shares have been falling pretty much ever since it announced that deal. So that is something to think about as well. I was just trying to search the conference call for some comments on Capri.And they did talk about it and talked about the case that it will create significant value for the two companies. Of course, we shall see over time if that is indeed how it works out. But the shares, little change on the back of these numbers.BRAD SMITH: And just, you know, additionally, the type of consumer that they're going after, too, right now, where you've got more of the engagement with Gen Z and millennials that they're trying to drive forward. They talked about that in the press release. Driving customer engagement across brands, acquiring 6.5 million new customers in North America alone. Roughly half of which were Gen Z and millennials. So particularly interesting what type of customer lifetime value they can get out of that relationship with the cohort as well.]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the stock market in general, then take a look at Stanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stocks. The high interest rate environment which started to take shape last year has not been great for the hedge fund industry. Most funds tend to do well when the stock market as a whole is rising, but the energy supply shocks of 2023 effectively bifurcated the stock market into two segments. These included growth stocks that fell as inflation rose and purchasing powers dropped, and traditional sectors such as petroleum, gas, and coal which rose as investors tried to profit from an effective reworking of the global energy market.The fall in the grace of growth stocks last year also took down several hedge funds with it. As a whole, the industry lost $208 billion in 2022, with funds such as Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global and Dan Loeb's Third Point Capital losing more than $20 billion cumulatively. For more details, you can check out 15 Best Hedge Funds to Work For.Amidst this turmoil, one hedge fund boss that remained relatively unscathed was Stanley Druckenmiller. Mr. Druckenmiller has decades of experience in the finance industry, and he set up his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, in 1981. He is also one of the most famous hedge fund investors in the history of the industry. While some of our readers might only be young enough to remember the British Pound's crash last year that nearly sent it to parity levels with the U.S. dollar, the British currency underwent similarly rapid depreciations in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Mr. Druckenmiller, working for George Soros at that time, capitalized on the latter when they correctly bet that the British government would be forced to devalue the Pound in 1992 and fail to meet the conditions for the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This netted them more than a billion dollars in profit.Story continuesThe hedge fund investor has since retired from managing investor capital after he closed down his fund in 2010 stating that the job became too stressful. Currently, he invests in the stock market through his family office, which also leaves him insulated against large scale capital withdrawal from hedge funds during times of crisis in the stock market such as the one that took place last year and in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus breakout.However, even though he has chosen to step back from the lucrative world of hedge fund investing, Mr. Druckenmiller still has his fingers on the pulse of the industry. 2023's first half has been a stunner for industry observers and investors, as, despite an uncertain U.S. economic outlook and high interest rates, indexes such as the NASDAQ 100, have posted stunning gains that have touched 45%. Much of these have been due to the hype in artificial intelligence. Speaking at an event in June, he shared insightful thoughts about artificial intelligence and its prospects, particularly during a potential recession.According to him:All of AI is not going to make it through whether we have a recession or not because they haven't separated the wheat from the chaff yet. But I do believe, unlike crypto, I think AI is real, it's probably, it could be as transformative as the Internet, it's a huge thing. And I think I've argued publicly that if staples can go up in price in a recession, why can't a company like NVIDIA if they go up; if they go up if their orders and earnings go up 70% in a hard landing - which is what I think would probably happen. It's not clear that NVIDIA goes down despite the lofty valuation level. History has proved that if you do, that if you have very good earnings in a recession, and they're sustainable, if they're not the market somehow figures it out, those stocks would do just fine. So we have some longs, we have some shorts, and the AI's sort of dominated the long portfolio for five or six months.So, what are Stanley Druckenmiller's latest investments?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.5b ÷ (US$44b - US$7.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 12%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 12%. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceIn the above chart we have measured NVIDIA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NVIDIA.What Can We Tell From NVIDIA's ROCE Trend?When we looked at the ROCE trend at NVIDIA, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 38%, but since then they've fallen to 12%. Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning. This could mean that the business is losing its competitive advantage or market share, because while more money is being put into ventures, it's actually producing a lower return - ""less bang for their buck"" per se.Story continuesOur Take On NVIDIA's ROCEIn summary, we're somewhat concerned by NVIDIA's diminishing returns on increasing amounts of capital. Since the stock has skyrocketed 556% over the last five years, it looks like investors have high expectations of the stock. Regardless, we don't feel too comfortable with the fundamentals so we'd be steering clear of this stock for now.If you'd like to know about the risks facing NVIDIA, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.While NVIDIA may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Shares continued their torrid first quarter rise, increasing 52.3% in the second quarter (now up 190% year-to-date), after the company reported a meaningful acceleration in demand for its data center GPUs, which drove a material guidance beat with revenues expected to increase from $7.2 billion to approximately $11 billion sequentially. This unprecedented acceleration is driven by growing demand for GenAI. We are at the tipping point of a new era of computing with NVIDIA at its epicenter. While the opportunity within the datacenter installed base is already large at approximately $1 trillion, the pace of innovation in AI in general, and GenAI in particular, should drive a significant expansion in the addressable market, as AI creates a new way for human-computer interaction through language, and as companies are better able to utilize their data for decision-making. We remain shareholders as we believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and the ecosystem it has cultivated over the last 15 years will benefit the company for years to come.""Story continuesPhoto by Christian Wiediger on UnsplashNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 17th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) is benefiting from a decrease in operating expenses and shareholder-friendly initiatives adopted by the company.The company recently reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 90 cents, which aligned with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined 66.2% year over year. Total revenues of $4421.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4646.5 million and declined 35% year over year owing to lower pricing in the company’s ocean and truckload services.How is C.H. Robinson Doing?C.H. Robinson’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In November 2022, the company hiked its dividend to 61 cents per share from 55 cents. CHRW is also active on the buyback front. C.H. Robinson rewarded its shareholders in 2022 through a combination of cash dividends ($285.32 million) and share repurchases ($1,488.28 million). Continuing the shareholder-friendly approach, in the second quarter of 2023, CHRW repurchased shares worth $33.4 million and paid $72.8 million in cash dividends.Decrease in operating expenses aids C.H. Robinson’s bottom-line results. Operating expenses declined 5.2% year over year to $532.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Personnel expenses decreased 15.2% to $377.3 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation.On the flip side, C.H. Robinson's second-quarter 2023 total revenues were unfavorably impacted by lower pricing its ocean and truckload services. Quarterly results were impacted by soft freight markets globally. Overall, weak demand, high inventories and excess capacity led to a more competitive marketplace and subdued transportation rates.Adjusted gross profit fell 35.5% year over year to $665.5 million in second-quarter 2023, owing to lower adjusted gross profit per transaction in truckload and ocean services. Adjusted operating margin of 19.9% declined 2,560 basis points.Story continuesThe company’s focus on making investments in technology, though aimed at long-term growth prospects, might weigh on C.H. Robinson’s bottom line in the near term. Capital expenditures for 2023 are anticipated to be between $90 million and $100 million.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, C.H. Robinson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are United Airlines (UAL) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW).

(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)As the Writers Guild of America tries to come to terms with Hollywood studios on a new contract, the union is blasting the Walt Disney Co., Netflix and Amazon as the ""new gatekeepers"" of media in a new antitrust report that accuses the entertainment behemoths of anti-competitive practices.The Thursday report, issued by the WGA's West Coast branch, comes after the guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major studios and streamers, restarted negotiations to end the writers' strike that has been going on for more than 100 days.Despite optimism sparked by the renewal of talks, the sides remain far apart on key issues, including the WGA's demands for minimum staffing requirements on TV writers’ rooms.The union's report argues that Disney, Netflix and Amazon have used their growing size and industry clout to undercut writers. The document details how media and tech companies have consolidated power through mergers and acquisitions, and called on government regulators to put a stop to it.Major acquisitions over the years have included Disney's purchase of 21st Century Fox in 2019 and Amazon's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, which was completed last year. The guild also contends that streamers like Netflix pioneered business models that reduced the pay of writers and were later adopted by other, more traditional companies, including Disney.The WGA report makes the case that vertical integration, which is when studios make content for their own distribution platforms, has hurt writers and will get only worse if it continues.""Each [company] is now taking anti-competitive vertical integration to an extreme, turning its streaming service into a walled garden for self-produced content — a model built for and dependent on restricting the availability of independent content from competing producers, underpaying creators, and, above all, making future consolidation the name of the industry game,"" the WGA West said.Story continuesDisney, Netflix and Amazon declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment.Read more: The WGA and AMPTP are talking again. Why the studios were motivated to return to the tableThe WGA has been on strike since May 2, with writers demanding better pay from streaming shows as well as protections from artificial intelligence and other industry shifts. SAG-AFTRA, the union representing actors and other performers, walked off the job in mid-July.Contract talks resumed only recently, after a long pause in bargaining. Though neither the AMPTP nor the WGA has commented on the progress of the talks or the details of their back-and-forth, the antitrust report is a barb against the studios at a sensitive time. It remains unclear how long it might take for a compromise to come to fruition. Few industry observers expect a quick resolution.""I think they would have a more conciliatory tone if they were anywhere close to an agreement,"" said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine University's Graziadio Business School.In its report, the WGA West raised concerns about more consolidation among streaming services in the future. The guild said that if big mergers and acquisitions continue, it will put more pressure on the wages of writers, who have already seen their pay eroded by the smaller number of episodes per season on streaming services.Read more: Writers' strike: What's at stake and how it could disrupt Hollywood""The accumulation of market power enables these companies to undervalue writing services and the writers who supply them,"" the WGA West said.

Ives estimates the potential cost of ESPN could be over $50 billion. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the pros and cons of the move for both Apple and Disney.Video Transcript- We have quite a few stories today. I want to kick us off with Apple, because we have an analyst, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, saying that he believes it would be a, quote, no-brainer for Apple to go ahead and acquire ESPN from Disney. Now we do know that Disney's CEO Bob Iger currently seeking strategic partnerships.That could be a positive for Apple as well. Dan Ives says, the cost of ESPN would be $50 billion, which ain't cheap. However, he says-- Apple. If anyone could afford it--- Apple has the money.- Has the money. And that it would be good when they're trying to shore up Apple TV+, especially since they already have some exposure to Major League sports, that sort of thing. But I know you have a hot take.- I don't have a hot take. I just don't fully agree with it. And Dan calls it a no-brainer. But then, also lists several reasons why it doesn't really follow how Apple has built out other products.Apple is not a big M&amp;A player when it comes to making a massive purchase like this. He points out really the biggest M&amp;A play they ever made was $3 billion for Beats. And I don't know if Apple went back, if they would make that purchase again. And so, you wonder, why would you pay $50 billion for a sports asset.Also, when we're talking about this deal, are you getting ESPN without ABC, or are you getting ESPN and the linear TV network, because right now, ESPN works very well because part of what they do with those sports properties is put them on ABC for everyone to see. And that's part of what you're building out, right? So what are you getting for $50 billion?- And that point is an interesting one, because right now, there's a lot of talk on Wall Street whether or not Disney should be broken up. Should it be split into two companies? One with the linear networks. One with ESPN.Story continuesBut analysts that I've spoken with have said the same thing. How does ESPN work without the linear networks, and vice versa? Where's the value in that?- And I also feel like ABC and ESPN, obviously, so integrated here. When you think about the attractions that we've seen in Florida. When you think about how the parks have been doing.How those attractions have been doing overall. When you think about the allure of ESPN and you think about just how interconnected they are, I just don't really see them breaking up at this time. I think that it's a crucial part of ABC'S operation, Disney overall. And I just don't see exactly how you could break up this huge powerhouse that's been in partnership now forever, it seems.- I think for me, it's just like if I'm Apple, why would I want to do this? I guess, like-- yes. Obviously, it would bring more people to Apple TV+, right? But they're in the business of-- well, they're in the business of making a profit too. And you're going to have to keep paying for more of these sports streaming rights that keep getting more expensive.Right now, there's a lot of streamers trying to figure out what to do with their large libraries of content. And Apple isn't really in that game necessarily, when we talk about the streamers. It's not like they have a massive library-- that has not been the strategy at Apple. It has been, we make high quality products.- Quality over quantity. And they don't pour nearly as much money into their content as some of their competitors. And there is this notion that, oh well, don't worry. The FANG companies will come in and save linear and save all these things because they have the money to do it. But to your point, why?- Well, they didn't go in and save college football when college football wanted them to, right? Everyone wanted Apple to go and pay more money than they should have for Pac-12 teams. And when it came down to it, Apple said no. The schools came back, and one of the reports was that they asked for $50 million. And Apple said, we're not paying you that much, because that's not how they really operate as a company.- It's really easy to say, yeah, sure. Apple will buy this because they can afford it.- They can afford it. But it wouldn't necessarily work for them. It wouldn't necessarily boost their subscriber numbers. It wouldn't necessarily bring people onto the platform. Like we're all saying, I don't think so, because there's still an existing linear that people are very loyal to. And I think about older consumers that-- I don't think they necessarily make the change to Apple + should this happen, should this deal go through.- And I don't even know if Disney's CEO Bob Iger would want to sell because right now, he's maintained-- ESPN is going to be a fully over-the-top streaming service.- And he's talked a lot about how sports are a big part of their vision. I mean, maybe he's just being a salesman because he wants to sell it, right? But he's certainly-- you listen to that earnings call. He played out--- He's also said linear networks stink. And he's like, but we'll sell that. So I don't--- And also to-- Dan Ives did point out to the relationship between Iger and Cook. And I thought that was pretty interesting, just to hear about how exactly they could build on this relationship. So maybe we won't see this partnership. But maybe, we could see--- Sports on the Vision Pro, I'm telling you. Sports on the Vision Pro.- Maybe it can happen.- Iger was at the event.]"

The Wall Street Journal estimates that the average cost of major ad-free streaming is up over 25% this year. Disney (DIS) is the latest player to announce price hikes, following Peacock, Max, and Apple TV+ who all have raised prices within the past year. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley details the rising prices by noting ""it's basically up across the board with every major streaming service.""Video Transcript- The cost of streaming is going up. Disney is the latest player to announce price hikes, raising costs for ad-free Disney and also Hulu, each by 20% or more. Peacock, Max, Paramount Plus, and Apple TV Plus have all raised their prices in the past year. And the Journal estimates that the average cost of major ad-free streaming is up nearly 25% in a year.For more on this, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley and Alexandra Canal to take a look at all angles of the streaming wars and how much people are paying right now. But Dan, when it comes to what's going on right now, how much more people are paying, what are we seeing, and, I guess, what kind of behavior, maybe, could we expect?DAN HOWLEY: It's basically up across the board for every major streaming service. It started more or less last year when Netflix raised their prices. Their premium plan went up to about $20. Then they started saying we're going to crack down on password sharing. They introduced their $6.99 ad supported plan. Now, if you try to share your password, you're going to have to chuck an extra $7.99 in there. Sorry, mom and dad.Then we also have Hulu. They raised their prices last year, along with Disney. Disney just did that again. We have Max, HBO, whatever they want to call it. They raised their prices. Peacock-- who's subscribing to Peacock? But whatever. They also raised their prices.And then YouTube TV, which I subscribe to for the Mets, raised their prices. I ranted about this, though. The Mets and SNY can't come to an agreement.Story continues- That's an expensive--- It is an expensive subscription. The YouTube TV one is the one that stood out to me. Go ahead, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: It's dumb. $64.99 to $72.99 for me to watch ""Naked and Afraid"" while I drink White Claw and get drunk and laugh at these people in the woods. Is it worth that? Is it worth that?- $72.99--ALEXANDRA CANAL: YouTube TV is supposed to be a cable replacement.- It is.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So it's in a different category than your Netflix or Apple TV Plus. But if you're only using it to watch ""Naked and Afraid,"" maybe not worth the $72. I don't know.DAN HOWLEY: Don't poo poo getting drunk and laughing at people.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, no. I'm not. I use it to watch ""Summer House"" exclusively, so, hey.- There you go.- All of these make you question, which of these do I still need? Do I need to have, of course, Netflix? Well, yes. But the Netflix, the Hulu, Disney, do you need-- well, Disney, Hulu, all together now basically. Do we need all of these? And you have consumers starting to, I guess, question these-- what we've looked at as little-- not necessarily-- little luxuries. They're not necessities, right?- They're certainly not necessities. But I think so many people just get used to having these subscriber service, and I'm speaking from firsthand experience, that if these companies do raise it by 20%, the likelihood of you're then going on and canceling. They're willing to take that chance. And we saw it here from a number of streamers over the last year.And yes, there has been a little bit of churn, but it's been a smart move on the streamers part just in terms of some of the pressure that they're seeing. They're trying to do everything they can to cut their losses, and this strategy is working. It's tough for us, but it's working for them.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And if you think about the password sharing crackdown, I mean, Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers in a large part due to the password sharing crackdown. So we might not like it, but we're doing it. And you brought up a good point with churn.Obviously, when you raise prices, that's a big risk. It is the critical problem that these streaming companies face. I've spoken to analysts about that. They can't ignore churn. However, I think it's worth noting that all of these subscription services, they have ad-supported tiers now, and they're cheaper.And one of the reasons why they're raising the prices on the ad-free plans is they're trying to convince consumers, well, don't cut us out entirely, just watch us with ads. That is a higher average revenue per user, that's that metric, RPU, very key to profitability. So there's a method behind the madness going on.- Do we think people are going to go back to cable, though? I mean, I actually still have cable.DAN HOWLEY: I don't think we're going to go back to cable, but the thing that's going to start happening is more bundling. We have the Hulu, Disney, ESPN Plus bundle. You're just going to see more of that, whether it's with carriers, whether it's through different platforms, and that's how it's going to be.And then some of the folks that I spoke to said think multiyear now contracts, where maybe you lower the monthly price, but you're hooked in for two years and then--- That's the cable model.DAN HOWLEY: Exactly. So it's all going back there. And I think one of the things with churn-- and I'm thinking about this is Netflix said that they're working on their cloud gaming initiative. Well, it's not because they want to compete with Microsoft and Sony. It's because they don't want you to leave when you got Stranger Things on there.I watched-- I went through-- we were talking about this earlier. I went through the carousel the other day of all the Netflix originals. It is trash, just complete trash. There was like one thing that I watched.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But you have a lot of content, right?DAN HOWLEY: Right. That's the thing.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And there's going to be new churn data out next week that I'm going to be tracking. But I have something right now from antenna, and this is monthly signups. Out of all the major streaming services, Apple TV Plus saw less monthly signups in June than they did a year ago. Everyone else is up.And even though Apple TV Plus, the content is really good, there's not a ton of it. And I think that's a big factor when people are weighing their decisions here. But bundling, absolutely. I hear that from literally every single person I talk to. That's a new frontier.DAN HOWLEY: That's cable.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, exactly.- And then you're going to be paying just as much as you were before, if not maybe even more. All right, Ali and Dan, thanks so much.]"

If Wedbush managing director Dan Ives gets his wish they might finally have to get along.Apple buying ESPN from Disney to accelerate its entry into the global sports media landscape would be a “no brainer,” Ives wrote in an analyst note yesterday. An acquisition, which he estimates would be in the $50 billion range, would make the Apple TV+ streaming service more attractive to subscribers by adding more live sports, the “golden goose” of content. “Cupertino plays chess while others play checkers,” Ives told Fortune in an email.The deal, he said, “would make a ton of strategic sense” for Apple because it would “gain valuable sports content, major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, and change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV, while putting Apple on the sports map globally.”ESPN declined to comment for this story. Apple did not return a request for comment.The speculation about an acquisition comes after Disney CEO Bob Iger floated the idea of selling a stake in ESPN, once the company’s crown jewel. The network is grappling with consumers abandoning their cable subscriptions, which puts its business in danger of a slow decline.Iger has said he is open to “strategic partners” that could help the company with either distribution or content, he told CNBC in July. Disney is “open minded” about the type of deal it would strike with a third party, or the value the partner might bring—content, distribution, or even just cash. The one imperative for any partner, however, was that they accelerate ESPN’s inevitable transition to streaming. “Taking our flagship ESPN channel direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if, but when,” Iger said on the earnings call earlier this month.Some of the partners Disney had in mind were the very sports leagues that are broadcast on ESPN. Disney reportedly offered equity stakes in ESPN to NBA, NFL, and MLB, presumably as part of negotiations for their contract renewals.Story continuesIn buying ESPN, Apple would give its Apple TV+ streaming service a lift. It has a limited amount of content compared to rivals like Netflix and Max and is trailing in market share.A deal would give Apple access to 74 million cable subscribers and an ESPN+ streaming service that has another 24 million paying customers, according to Disney’s 2022 annual report. Despite a decline in Disney’s ad revenue from cable overall, ESPN’s revenue was up a modest 4% in its latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, and up 2% from the prior quarter, Disney chief financial officer Kevin Lansberry said on the company’s latest earrings call.So far, Apple has dabbled in sports content, acquiring the broadcast rights for leagues like the MLB and the MLS. With the MLS, Apple landed the league’s global distribution rights rather than national or regional ones that are the standard for live event broadcast rights. Apple also narrowly missed out on a college sports deal with the Pac-12 before a conference realignment earlier this month scuttled its plans at the last minute.Meanwhile, Disney is already making some changes at ESPN. Earlier this month, it entered into a 10-year, $1.5 billion licensing agreement with the casino and sportsbook operator PENN Entertainment that will allow PENN to use the ESPN brand on all its sports betting assets.In March, Disney's companywide layoffs of 7,000 hit ESPN as part of a plan to trim $5.5 billion in costs. That was followed earlier this summer by ESPN cutting a raft of high profile on-air talent.In his note, Ives cites challenges to Apple buying ESPN, including Apple’s long-time reluctance to make major acquisitions. The last time it made a major acquisition was in 2014 when it purchased music headphone maker Beats for $3 billion. At the time, in addition to its headphones, Beats had an upstart music streaming service that was eventually folded into Apple Music.There’s also the question mark raised by a hawkish Federal Trade Commission, chaired by Lina Khan, who’s made her aversion to tech mergers the foundation of her career. Ives, though, characterizes Khan and the FTC as “bark worse than bite,” implying that regulators are surmountable hurdles rather than outright impediments to a future deal.Finally, Ives’ prediction of an Apple acquisition runs up against the reality of Iger being thus far unequivocal about Disney’s commitment to sports, making a full sale unlikely. “Sports stands tall in a sea of tremendous choice, and is in many respects an advertiser's dream and consumer's dream,” Iger said in the CNBC interview in July. “We have a unique position and we feel that we should stay in it.”And in August, Iger reiterated that most of the terms of a possible deal were flexible, except for one: Disney “retain control of ESPN.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $5.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.25. Its operating margin of 11.24% is better than 79.5% of companies in the Hardware industry.

However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 6.4%, which ranks worse than 58.66% of companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also provide insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Juniper Networks's ROIC is 7.44 while its WACC came in at 8.78.Is Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR) Modestly Undervalued?ConclusionIn summary, the stock of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) is believed to be modestly undervalued.

Tech giant beat big on the top and bottom lines as it continues to ramp up and focus on artificial intelligence and also give more money back to shareholders. Joining me right now is Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins. Chuck, nice to see you.CHUCK ROBBINS: Nice to see you, Brian. Thanks for having me.BRIAN SOZZI: So, coming into this quarter, I think there was a lot of pessimism on what you would report. Some company, I would say called Juniper, I think sparked a lot of worry in the marketplace, but I didn't really see that in your results. Sales up-- product sales up 20%, service revenue up 4%. What did the market get wrong?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, I think the primary difference between some of our peers is that they have a higher concentration or a higher exposure to the service provider segment, which was weak for us as well. But we have a much more diverse book of business. And so the enterprise and public sector, and commercial all offset it. But look, it was one quarter. Teams did a great job. We were really happy with how they executed. But still a lot of dynamics out there.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: And the margins in your business up pretty significantly as well. Is that just inflation coming down, and you benefiting from that?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, a lot of it is-- a lot of the costs that we incurred with the supply chain challenges have subsided a bit. But it's also just the teams do a great job. Our supply chain team and our engineering teams do a great job on just continuing to find efficiencies in how we build our products.BRIAN SOZZI: This is a strange time in the economy. And look, I mean, today we have Walmart coming out here saying more people making over 100 grand are shopping it stores. Who would have thought. It's Walmart. What's your read on the economy here? Make sense of it for us.CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, I'm not sure I can make sense of it for you. But I think it's clearly mixed. I mean, we-- as I said, we saw improvement in our commercial, which is sort of the mid-market down, we saw improvement in our enterprise business, and public sector was pretty steady, but service provider was very weak.And I think there's industries that are doing OK. We saw financial services, transportation was strong. But I think it's just a little mixed and just a lot of dynamics that we're watching on a very regular basis.BRIAN SOZZI: What are you most concerned about as we go into the back half of the year from an economic standpoint?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, first of all, I think that technology has become so core to how organizations run. This is not an optional thing, it's not a cost center, it's not some underlying ERP system anymore, it's deep in the heart of the strategy of these organizations. So there's not as much likelihood that you just completely stop spending on technology. Most of our customers will say that's the last thing we'll stop spending on right now.They're being more thoughtful about which projects are being funded, which ones are the most important, and which ones that they're going to focus on. But as we look to the second half of the year, I think obviously getting inflation under control will be really important, geopolitical dynamics around the world are very important. And hopefully, we will see inflation continue to subside over the next few months.BRIAN SOZZI: What's your read on the China economy? I think markets are really under pressure right now because of a China economic slowdown. You have exposure there, are you seeing that?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, we are very lightly exposed to China. It's less than 2% of our business. So it's not a significant part. But clearly, it seems to not be coming back online as fast as everyone expected them to. And I think that they'll continue to work the policy, they lowered their rates, which was interesting. And I know that the economic growth in China is one of the most important topics for the leadership there. So I expect they'll continue to make whatever moves they need to make.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you think we'll see, or are you seeing any signs of a contagion? China's slowing down. We're going to get that here in the US.CHUCK ROBBINS: Not at this point. In fact, we saw improvement sequentially in the US. Again it was one quarter, but we saw improvement.BRIAN SOZZI: In terms of sequential improvements, you did call it out in the earnings call, where are you seeing customers come back little quicker than you thought?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, the enterprise in the United States, our large enterprise customers, particularly financial services, it was our largest enterprise software agreement quarter in the history of the company. So big customers making big commitments. And didn't hear a lot of, well, I think we're just going to push that off a bit.I mean, when you think about the need to invest in cybersecurity, the need to invest in this whole technology re-architecture for this multi-cloud world we live in, everybody's rebuilding applications and needs observability and insights that we can provide to them. Everybody's trying to solve this hybrid work problem, and everybody's focused now on leveraging technology for sustainability. So I mean, every customer. And so we're just fortunate there are a lot of things that we have a role to play in.BRIAN SOZZI: When does Cisco start cleaning up on AI?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, it's important to understand the actual technology. And these GPUs, which you're the brains in these AI networks, they have to be connected. And what we-- there's a technology that has existed for a while that is currently connecting those. And we build obviously ethernet infrastructure which is what the cloud providers want to move to. And so we're getting some early wins with some of this next-generation ethernet. And-- but we think that FY 24, which we're just starting, we'll see some benefit, but we think the real move to this new technology for connecting these GPUs will be in fiscal '25.BRIAN SOZZI: Was that-- so you've incurred a $500 million in the most recent quarter from AI-related what chips Silicon One is it called.CHUCK ROBBINS: We said we've booked-- we've taken $500 million in orders to date. It wasn't all in that quarter. It's actually systems that are connecting these AI processors, basically. So we-- they have to be connected at the end of the day. And so we actually provide the networking equipment underneath. And we think that the opportunity over the next five, six, seven years could be three times what the original Cloud Build out was.BRIAN SOZZI: Can you make enough of this technology? I think all the stories right now are what you look at in what Nvidia is doing. They're leading in many respects these AI chips, but they can't make enough of them. Can you make enough products to service the demand you're seeing?CHUCK ROBBINS: Absolutely.BRIAN SOZZI: All right fair enough. Now, in addition to AI, you're also-- sound a little different in terms of capital commitment. Returning more cash to shareholders, why that shift in tone?CHUCK ROBBINS: Well, we've been talking to a lot of our shareholders. We talk to them quite regularly, obviously. And it just became apparent that what they really wanted to see was they wanted to see more consistency and a higher level of buybacks, which we have the balance sheet and the cash to do. And they wanted to see operating leverage. They wanted to see earnings per share grow faster than revenue.And ironically, we've been doing both of those things for the last-- we had leverage in the model growing EPS faster for the last couple of years. And we had increased and gotten very consistent with our buyback, but we had never declared that as a permanent strategy. So really, what we did yesterday is we told them that this is our strategy going forward, and you should expect it from us in the future.BRIAN SOZZI: Does a commitment like that mean Cisco is out of the big M&amp;A game?CHUCK ROBBINS: No, we have plenty of-- we have a strong balance sheet. We have a lot of flexibility.BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly, the Webex business under a little pressure as people, I guess, go back into the office and do their thing. What's your commitment to that business? And then, more broadly, on the return to office, where do you stand? Do you want to see your employees back in the office?CHUCK ROBBINS: So, first of all, in our collaboration portfolio, the teams have done an amazing job. Most every customer right now is transitioning to cloud-based calling. And so our teams have shifted and are leading with cloud-based calling and collabora-- and the meetings portion of it is part of the suite that they get to do that.So actually, meetings orders last quarter were up double digits. It was actually quite positive. And the overall portfolio was up significantly. Our cloud contact center, which is also part of that, which is customer experience being delivered from the cloud, was up triple digits. And so we're very committed to that business.As it relates to hybrid work, what we've told our teams is that we let the team decide how frequently and how valuable is it for you to be in the office together, and then they make that call. But we see a slight increase as employees are starting to want to come back to the office. And our general belief is that we're changing all our offices because we want them to be a magnet and not a mandate, and we want people to want to come back.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you see your productivity go up as people get back in the office?CHUCK ROBBINS: We just had a record year. So I think, I mean-- but you got to remember, we were in this mode to some extent before the pandemic. 70 plus percent of our first-line managers have at least one remote employee already. We already had 12% to 14% of our employees that worked from home full-time. Based on the job they were doing was fine to work from home. So this was not a radical new thing for us it's just a little more broad-based than it was before the pandemic.BRIAN SOZZI: All right. Let's leave it there. I know it's busy post-earnings day for you.CHUCK ROBBINS: Yes.BRIAN SOZZI: Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins. Always nice to see you. Thanks for coming down.CHUCK ROBBINS: Thanks, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: Appreciate it.]"

The Wall Street Journal estimates that the average cost of major ad-free streaming is up over 25% this year. Disney (DIS) is the latest player to announce price hikes, following Peacock, Max, and Apple TV+ who all have raised prices within the past year. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley details the rising prices by noting ""it's basically up across the board with every major streaming service.""Video Transcript- The cost of streaming is going up. Disney is the latest player to announce price hikes, raising costs for ad-free Disney and also Hulu, each by 20% or more. Peacock, Max, Paramount Plus, and Apple TV Plus have all raised their prices in the past year. And the Journal estimates that the average cost of major ad-free streaming is up nearly 25% in a year.For more on this, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley and Alexandra Canal to take a look at all angles of the streaming wars and how much people are paying right now. But Dan, when it comes to what's going on right now, how much more people are paying, what are we seeing, and, I guess, what kind of behavior, maybe, could we expect?DAN HOWLEY: It's basically up across the board for every major streaming service. It started more or less last year when Netflix raised their prices. Their premium plan went up to about $20. Then they started saying we're going to crack down on password sharing. They introduced their $6.99 ad supported plan. Now, if you try to share your password, you're going to have to chuck an extra $7.99 in there. Sorry, mom and dad.Then we also have Hulu. They raised their prices last year, along with Disney. Disney just did that again. We have Max, HBO, whatever they want to call it. They raised their prices. Peacock-- who's subscribing to Peacock? But whatever. They also raised their prices.And then YouTube TV, which I subscribe to for the Mets, raised their prices. I ranted about this, though. The Mets and SNY can't come to an agreement.Story continues- That's an expensive--- It is an expensive subscription. The YouTube TV one is the one that stood out to me. Go ahead, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: It's dumb. $64.99 to $72.99 for me to watch ""Naked and Afraid"" while I drink White Claw and get drunk and laugh at these people in the woods. Is it worth that? Is it worth that?- $72.99--ALEXANDRA CANAL: YouTube TV is supposed to be a cable replacement.- It is.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So it's in a different category than your Netflix or Apple TV Plus. But if you're only using it to watch ""Naked and Afraid,"" maybe not worth the $72. I don't know.DAN HOWLEY: Don't poo poo getting drunk and laughing at people.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, no. I'm not. I use it to watch ""Summer House"" exclusively, so, hey.- There you go.- All of these make you question, which of these do I still need? Do I need to have, of course, Netflix? Well, yes. But the Netflix, the Hulu, Disney, do you need-- well, Disney, Hulu, all together now basically. Do we need all of these? And you have consumers starting to, I guess, question these-- what we've looked at as little-- not necessarily-- little luxuries. They're not necessities, right?- They're certainly not necessities. But I think so many people just get used to having these subscriber service, and I'm speaking from firsthand experience, that if these companies do raise it by 20%, the likelihood of you're then going on and canceling. They're willing to take that chance. And we saw it here from a number of streamers over the last year.And yes, there has been a little bit of churn, but it's been a smart move on the streamers part just in terms of some of the pressure that they're seeing. They're trying to do everything they can to cut their losses, and this strategy is working. It's tough for us, but it's working for them.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And if you think about the password sharing crackdown, I mean, Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers in a large part due to the password sharing crackdown. So we might not like it, but we're doing it. And you brought up a good point with churn.Obviously, when you raise prices, that's a big risk. It is the critical problem that these streaming companies face. I've spoken to analysts about that. They can't ignore churn. However, I think it's worth noting that all of these subscription services, they have ad-supported tiers now, and they're cheaper.And one of the reasons why they're raising the prices on the ad-free plans is they're trying to convince consumers, well, don't cut us out entirely, just watch us with ads. That is a higher average revenue per user, that's that metric, RPU, very key to profitability. So there's a method behind the madness going on.- Do we think people are going to go back to cable, though? I mean, I actually still have cable.DAN HOWLEY: I don't think we're going to go back to cable, but the thing that's going to start happening is more bundling. We have the Hulu, Disney, ESPN Plus bundle. You're just going to see more of that, whether it's with carriers, whether it's through different platforms, and that's how it's going to be.And then some of the folks that I spoke to said think multiyear now contracts, where maybe you lower the monthly price, but you're hooked in for two years and then--- That's the cable model.DAN HOWLEY: Exactly. So it's all going back there. And I think one of the things with churn-- and I'm thinking about this is Netflix said that they're working on their cloud gaming initiative. Well, it's not because they want to compete with Microsoft and Sony. It's because they don't want you to leave when you got Stranger Things on there.I watched-- I went through-- we were talking about this earlier. I went through the carousel the other day of all the Netflix originals. It is trash, just complete trash. There was like one thing that I watched.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But you have a lot of content, right?DAN HOWLEY: Right. That's the thing.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And there's going to be new churn data out next week that I'm going to be tracking. But I have something right now from antenna, and this is monthly signups. Out of all the major streaming services, Apple TV Plus saw less monthly signups in June than they did a year ago. Everyone else is up.And even though Apple TV Plus, the content is really good, there's not a ton of it. And I think that's a big factor when people are weighing their decisions here. But bundling, absolutely. I hear that from literally every single person I talk to. That's a new frontier.DAN HOWLEY: That's cable.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, exactly.- And then you're going to be paying just as much as you were before, if not maybe even more. All right, Ali and Dan, thanks so much.]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like United Rentals (NYSE:URI). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for United Rentals United Rentals' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that United Rentals' EPS has grown 31% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. United Rentals shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 26% to 28%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for United Rentals.Story continuesAre United Rentals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$32b company like United Rentals. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$143m. We note that this amounts to 0.5% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of United Rentals but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add United Rentals To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that United Rentals has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in United Rentals' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for United Rentals that we have uncovered.Although United Rentals certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

(NYSE:MTD),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-mettler-toledo-102907512.html,1692354547,STORY,['MTD'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Mettler-Toledo International is US$1,052 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$1,205 share price, Mettler-Toledo International appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$1,324 analyst price target for MTD is 26% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$928.3mUS$1.02bUS$1.03bUS$1.10bUS$1.14bUS$1.18bUS$1.22bUS$1.25bUS$1.29bUS$1.32bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.15%Est @ 3.55%Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$869US$895US$842US$843US$822US$797US$770US$741US$712US$683(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.0bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = US$29bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$29b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$23b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$1.2k, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mettler-Toledo International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.929. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Mettler-Toledo InternationalStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Ex-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker are board members.The complaints come as many experts expect an uptick in challenges to corporate diversity programs following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that prohibited race-conscious college admissions policies.The growing scrutiny underscores competing pressures that companies face to implement diversity initiatives but also to rein them in amid conservative backlash, according to Rick Rossein, a professor at the City University of New York School of Law. Legal complaints like the ones filed by America First could drive employers to be more cautious, he said.“There certainly is a deep psychological effect that is putting the brakes on the forward movement of diversity in the workplace,” Rossein said.America First's complaints cite a range of hiring, promotion and contracting programs. They include a Starbucks initiative designed to boost diversity in senior leadership and McDonald's policy of evaluating executives based in part on their efforts to diversify the company's workforce.Story continuesAmerica First has also filed lawsuits accusing Target Corp and Progressive Insurance of breaching their duties to shareholders by adopting diversity programs and progressive marketing campaigns, for instance celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month.Kellogg said in a statement it complies with employment laws and has anti-discrimination policies in place. Hershey said in a statement it does not tolerate discrimination and that ""we believe our business is stronger when we are inclusive.""Activision and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.It is difficult to say whether the EEOC, which enforces federal laws banning workplace discrimination and currently has a Democratic majority, will take up America First's complaints.The agency's investigations are typically triggered by complaints from workers. But its five commissioners, who are appointed by the president, can bring their own complaints that can lead to probes and lawsuits.So-called ""commissioner's charges"" are relatively rare, with 29 filed last year, up from only three in each of the previous two years.Commissioner Andrea Lucas, a Trump appointee, filed a dozen charges last year, more than any of her colleagues. Lucas has said poorly-planned diversity programs can be illegal, and that the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action should be a wake-up call to employers that they cannot include race or gender preferences in workplace policies.Lucas declined to comment on whether she is considering filing charges against any company relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. EEOC commissioners are legally barred from confirming the existence of a specific charge or investigation.Gene Hamilton, America First's vice president and general counsel and a former Trump administration lawyer, said in a statement that it was patently illegal for companies to ""obsess"" over the demographics of their workforces.""Major corporations ... apparently do not care as much about the quality of the products that they make, but the race and sex of the employees who make their products,"" he said.

It is actively expanding its mobile ordering and payment services, incorporating a fresh curbside check-in feature. A growing emphasis on delivery underscores MCD’s commitment to elevating customer satisfaction and convenience, a focus that extends to over 100 countries.The company’s strategic collaborations with Uber Eats and DoorDash represents a notable step forward in its delivery initiatives. Particularly, within the past year, the proportion of delivery sales has doubled in key markets such as Australia, Canada and the United States.Ever since the launch of loyalty program in the United States, MCD has been able to transform its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in. Along with helping in to retain existing customers the program is expanding customer base. The company has already introduced a loyalty program in more than 50 markets, including the United States, Germany, Canada, U.K., Australia and France.During second-quarter 2023, MCD introduced Frequent Fryer program. Following the launch, it reported a rise in digital acquisition and digital customer frequency.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.3%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Even while not generating a profit, Seagate Technology Holdings is paying out most of its free cash flows as a dividend. Generally it is unsustainable for a company to be paying a dividend while unprofitable, and with limited reinvestment into the business growth may be slow.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 53%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.28, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.1% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings per share has shrunk at 12% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Seagate Technology Holdings is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

269,ce07e9e5-6d4d-358f-823a-4c064032e225,PCAR,2023-08-18,PACCAR and Ashland have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-ashland-highlighted-zacks-bull-115700280.html,1692273420,STORY,"['ASH', 'PCAR', 'WMB', 'KMI', 'MPLX']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 17, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PACCAR Inc. PCAR as the Bull of the Day and Ashland Inc. ASH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc WMB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:PACCAR Inc. is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and customer support of high-quality premium trucks. In addition, PACCAR also offers finance and leasing services.Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across the board for PACCAR as of late, helping land the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company resides within the Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry, which is currently ranked in the top 21% of all industries thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions. As many know, roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries seeing improved outlooks.Outside of the favorable earnings outlook, let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of PACCAR.Current StandingThe company is forecasted to witness notable growth in its current year, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.54 implying 50% growth paired with a 20% revenue bump. Growth cools in FY24, with earnings and revenue forecasted to retreat by 20% and 9%, respectively.Shares could interest those who prefer income, as PCAR shares currently yield 1.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 13% of the company's earnings. PCAR has displayed a shareholder-friendly nature, carrying a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.PACCAR has been firing on all cylinders as of late, exceeding both consensus revenue and EPS expectations in three consecutive quarters.Just in its latest release on July 25th, the company penciled in a 9% EPS beat and reported revenue 2% ahead of the consensus. Undoubtedly a positive, revenue and net income reflected quarterly records, primarily driven by the company's industry-leading logistics performance.Story continuesPACCAR's revenue has recovered from 2020 lows, with sales now eclipsing pre-pandemic levels.In addition, the company's 29.8% return on equity (ROE) is worthy of a highlight, reflecting a higher efficiency level in generating profits from existing assets relative to peers.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.PACCAR would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:Ashland Inc. is a leading specialty chemicals company serving various consumer and industrial markets, including automotive, construction, architectural coatings, adhesives, energy, food &amp; beverage, and pharmaceutical.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook across the board, pushing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In addition, the company resides in the Zacks Chemical – Specialty industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 22% of all Zacks industries. Let's take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.Current StandingAshland shares have struggled to find their footing in 2023, down roughly 19% and widely underperforming relative to the general market. Recent quarterly results haven't impressed the market, with ASH shares remaining on a downward trajectory.Regarding the most recent quarterly release, ASH fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 12% and reported revenue marginally below expectations. It reflected the company's second consecutive quarter of missing on both the top and bottom lines.Top line growth has remained somewhat stagnant over the last several years.Shares do pay a solid dividend, currently yielding 1.8% annually paired with a payout ratio sitting at 30% of the company's earnings. Dividend growth is there, too, with the payout growing by an annualized 8% over the last five years.The company's growth is slated to taper in its current year, with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting an 18% pullback in earnings on 7.5% lower revenues. Still, growth resumes in FY24, with expectations suggesting 20% higher earnings and a 5% revenue bump.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and recent negative quarterly results paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.Ashland is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Midstream Stocks to Gain Amid Energy Market VolatilityThe initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $80 per barrel.The business model of most energy players, by nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc., MPLX LP and The Williams Companies Inc.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well-poised to gain, and hence, investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan is poised to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.MPLX: The firm has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to buy back the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies: It is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. WMB's assets can meet 30% of the nation's consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

We will also discuss the emerging trends in the fintech industry and the recent decline in global funding. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Fastest Growing Fintech Companies In 2023.Recent Trends In Fintech IndustryFintech is simply the use of technology and software in the financial sector. Fintech enables consumers to efficiently deal with their finances while bypassing the hassle of traditional banks. The emergence of the fintech industry bears immense significance as it can revolutionize financial services delivery globally. According to a report by EMR, the global fintech market was valued at $194.1 billion in 2022 and has been estimated to grow to $492.81 billion by 2028 at a compounded annual growth rate of 16.8%.The advancement of information technology globally has expanded the customer base for fintech. The pandemic catalyzed the widespread adoption of fintech. According to a report by BCG, in 2019, fintech received 20% of all global venture capital outlays, and by 2021 it represented 9% of all global financial service valuations. For almost a decade, fintech has received billions of dollars in funding; however, it started plummeting in 2022. Rising inflation and interest rates, growing geopolitical tensions, and supply chain problems have all contributed to this decline in funding. According to a report by CB Insights, global fintech funding dropped 46%, and deals fell 8% year over year from 2021 to 2022. During this time, there was also a drop in the number of fintech unicorns born. Therefore, 2022 was not the best year for fintech companies overall. This decline in global funding has continued in 2023 as well. According to another report by CB Insights, a 48% decline has been recorded in global fintech funding in 2023. Even the most valuable fintech companies in the world were not safe from the impact of this massive decline.Story continues Many fintech companies have shifted their focus towards unit economics to recover from the downturn. The companies aim to emerge stronger on the other side of this slow funding era by strengthening the business's fundamentals, like innovation and recurring customers. On July 19, Reuters reported that fintech companies have started to impose stricter lending standards amid the current funding environment easing their way to debt financing from Wall Street.On August 7, Reuters reported that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) launched a US dollar stablecoin making it the first major fintech company to conduct transactions in a digital currency. Stablecoins have a monetary value dependent on a stable asset which makes them relatively immune to drastic changes in their worth. Stablecoins are used mainly to buy other cryptocurrencies. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) enables users to redeem their stablecoins for US dollars at any given time. As of August 17, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is worth $64 billion on the open market.Regional Insights And Noteworthy CompaniesAccording to the report by BCG, Asia Pacific is on track to be the largest fintech market by 2030 at a projected CAGR of 27%. The APAC region has a massive underbanked population and growing attention toward tech-savvy solutions, making the perfect ingredients for rapid growth. China and India are expected to lead this transition. North America currently is the most dominant in the global fintech market, and the US is estimated to contribute significantly to total global fintech revenue through 2030. Europe also has immense potential and is expected to grow rapidly in terms of fintech. The BCG report estimates that the US and Europe will have a revenue CAGR of 17% and 21%, respectively. Moreover, Latin America and Africa are expected to be the fastest-growing regions in fintech by 2030. These regions have massive underbanked populations and are moving towards digitization, posing a great opportunity for fintech to grow. These numbers indicate that despite the current turbulent landscape the fintech industry has a lot of potential to grow. On June 28, Reuters reported that the payment giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is acquiring a Brazilian fintech startup named Pismo for $1 billion, marking the largest fintech exit in that region since Nubank (NYSE:NU) went public. Pismo will continue with its current management team under Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).  There are many fintech companies growing at a noteworthy rate in 2023. Some of the most prominent companies that have stood strong during this time include Nubank (NYSE:NU), LM Funding America, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMFA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). These companies have managed to not only survive but grow during the current uncertain situation faced by the fintech industry globally. Nubank (NYSE:NU) is one of the most prominent fintech companies in the world. It is a giant in the Latin American fintech market. It has become the fourth-largest financial institution in Brazil. Nubank (NYSE:NU) has been rapidly gaining customers and is growing quickly. The blooming number of customers has contributed greatly to the growth of the company. Nubank (NYSE:NU) is among the most promising fintech stocks to buy. On August 15, the company reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. Nubank (NYSE:NU) reported earnings per share of $0.05 and beat EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.87 billion, up 61.43% year over year, and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $93.34 million.

Also, it reflects American Express’ sincere efforts to expand its network and address the everyday spending needs of its Cardmembers.American Express often resorts to extending the widespread benefits of digital payment solutions to its Cardmembers and such an endeavor seems to be aptly timed amid the ongoing wave of digitization inflicted across the globe. Such beneficial offerings bear testament to AXP’s efforts to incorporate new options or upgrade existing ones within its card offerings.With the card-issuing business remaining an important source of revenues for American Express, the latest initiative is expected to contribute to its top-line growth. Revenues of AXP are anticipated to grow in the range of 15-17% in 2023 and witness more than 10% improvement on an annual basis in the long term.American Express seems to occupy a strong foothold across the transit system of Canada and an enhanced digital suite, built through constant tie-ups and significant investments, is likely to have helped it in solidifying nationwide presence. AXP remains steadfast in infusing great digitization within the transit system of Canada.Story continuesAs a testament to the same, American Express teamed up with Metrolinx last year to bring the tap to pay facility for its Cardmembers across GO Transit and UP Express. In addition to this, its Cardmembers can also enjoy the hassle-free payment facility across several public transit agencies of Canada, namely Brampton Transit, Burlington Transit, Durham Region Transit, Hamilton Street Railway, MiWay, Oakville Transit and York Region Transit. Since 2019, the lucrative facility can be availed across the public transit system of Vancouver, TransLink.Shares of American Express have gained 8.8% year to date, compared with the industry’s 5.5% growth.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230817539533/en/Support the Trades launched in 2021, offering exclusive branded merchandise in Tractor Supply stores and at TractorSupply.com. For this year’s third Carhartt-designed collection, the lineup has expanded to include short- and long-sleeved shirts in a variety of colors, three different ball caps and two knit hats.For every item sold, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to SkillsUSA, a nonprofit that serves middle school, high school and college/postsecondary students preparing for careers in trade, technical and skilled service occupations. These include welders and machinists, plumbers and landscape architects, and beyond. Tractor Supply Company, the Tractor Supply Company Foundation and Carhartt each committed a $50,000 donation for a total of $150,000.""Many of our Team Members and customers either work in the skilled trades or have deep connections to them,"" said Jamie Martin, vice president, divisional merchandise manager at Tractor Supply. ""Support the Trades provides financial assistance to help young people pursue these in-demand but often overlooked opportunities – jobs that are so critical to sustaining Life Out Here.""According to a forecasting model developed by Associated Builders and Contractors, this year alone, the construction industry will need to attract an estimated 546,000 additional workers on top of the normal pace of hiring to meet the demand for labor. With only a small portion of those who do join the construction industry entering the skilled trades, the number of skilled workers is growing at a slower pace than that of construction laborers, and in some cases, declining. Nearly one in four construction workers is nearing retirement age, making the skills shortage especially concerning.Story continuesSince the start of the pandemic, there has been a renewed focus on the importance of skilled trades and the need to close the skills gap, thanks to initiatives like ""Support the Trades."" In response, enrollment in construction trade programs grew 19.3% from 2021 to 2022, and mechanic and repair trade programs saw an enrollment increase of 11.5%.

278,0b8d6964-7899-3d86-b2ee-5c9fe90f7845,MDLZ,2023-08-18,10 Best Consumer Staples ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-consumer-staples-etfs-115333465.html,1692359613,STORY,"['PG', 'WMT', 'KO', 'MDLZ', 'ADM']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best consumer staples ETFs to invest in. If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at some more ETFs, go directly to the 5 Best Consumer Staples ETFs.Consumer staples are an integral part of the average person's daily life, encompassing essential items we depend on regularly. These include necessities like food and beverages, personal care items, household and cleaning products such as paper goods, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and cosmetics.As previously mentioned in one of our articles, the consumer staples sector demonstrated remarkable performance in 2022, even in the face of elevated inflation. By December 9, 2022, the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index had achieved a gain of 0.37%, contrasting with the substantial 16.17% decline observed in the S&amp;P 500, as reported earlier.The purchase of consumer staples remains consistent regardless of the economic conditions, with a relatively stable quantity being bought during both prosperous and challenging times. For instance, the data presented by Hargreaves Lansdown reveals a compelling trend. During the height of the stock market's impact due to the coronavirus pandemic, the FTSE All Share Index experienced a substantial drop of 29.5% by March 18, 2020. In stark contrast, within the same timeframe, the consumer staples sector exhibited a significantly milder decline of just 13.24%, underscoring its resilience even in the face of significant market challenges. This sets the consumer staples sector apart from consumer discretionary enterprises like restaurants, hotels, and apparel, as well as consumer durables—durable goods such as furniture and electronics—that are more sensitive to market fluctuations. However, this stability often entails a trade-off, as significant explosive growth prospects are limited. This compromise is the inconspicuous price for enjoying stability during periods of uncertainty. Additionally, in the event of an economic upturn, other market sectors are poised to reap greater benefits compared to this particular industry.Story continuesRisk-averse investors looking to secure their investments against inflation can opt to increasing their exposure to the consumer staples sector by choosing consumer staples ETFs instead of investing in individual consumer staples stocks. A consumer staples ETF is an investment vehicle that focuses on consumer staples equities. ETFs have gained popularity over the years for several reasons. They offer diversification, allowing investors to access a range of stocks through a single investment, eliminating the need to purchase each stock separately. Furthermore, ETFs provide greater stability due to their lower volatility compared to individual stocks.When it comes to discussing the consumer staples industry, it's worth examining the perspective of one of the global giants in the consumer staples sector, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), regarding the industry's prospects for the current year. As stated by its management:These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7.4% reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales.Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year’s elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double-digits in food categories. It’s important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains and grocery continued, including from higher income households as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience.Best Consumer Staples ETFsPhoto by Fikri Rasyid on UnsplashNotable examples of consumer staples ETFs encompass the iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC), among other options.Our MethodologyWe have curated a selection of ETFs that provide access to consumer staples stocks across various market capitalizations, including large-, mid-, and small-cap companies. This compilation aims to encompass a comprehensive array of well-regarded funds listed on US exchanges. Moreover, we have mentioned the top holdings of these ETFs, which includes the likes of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), to provide more insight to prospective investors. Notably, these energy ETFs have achieved noteworthy growth over the past 5 years. The list is organized in ascending order based on the 5-year performance as of August 14, 2023.Best Consumer Staples ETFs10. iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 18.75%The iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI) replicates the performance of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Consumer Staples Sector Index. This consumer staples-oriented ETF provides investors with the opportunity to invest in businesses located across diverse countries, including the United States, Switzerland, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The encompassed companies comprise food manufacturers, distributors, producers of nondurable household goods, and enterprises involved in food and drug retailing. Established in August 2018, the fund currently manages assets worth $1.483 billion.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the top stocks in iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI)’s portfolio. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stands as a multinational consumer goods corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was established in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The corporation offers branded consumer packaged goods on a global scale, functioning through distinct segments including Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. During fiscal Q3 2023, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) recorded a 3.5% year-over-year growth in revenue, amounting to $20.07 billion. The company’s operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Similar to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in.9. Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 21.34%The basis of the Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL) lies in the Dorsey Wright® Consumer Staples Technical Leaders Index. Typically, the fund will allocate at least 90% of its overall assets to the securities constituting the Index. The Index is structured to pinpoint companies exhibiting relative strength (momentum) and includes a minimum of 30 stocks sourced from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index.e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) stands as Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL)'s top stock by percentage. The company offers cosmetic and skincare products globally through its brands, including e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. Skin, Well People, and Keys Soulcare. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) anticipates net sales for fiscal 2024 to fall within the bracket of $705 million to $720 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $637.72 million. Similarly, the projected range for adjusted diluted earnings per share is set at $1.73 to $1.76, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.64.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines (IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF). Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”8. Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 30.06%The foundation of the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) lies in the S&amp;P SmallCap 600® Capped Consumer Staples Index.

First Trust Nasdaq Food &amp; Beverage ETF (NASDAQ:FTXG)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 30.19%The primary objective of the First Trust Nasdaq Food &amp; Beverage ETF (NASDAQ:FTXG) is to achieve investment outcomes that generally align with the price and yield of the Nasdaq US Smart Food &amp; Beverage TM Index.

Additionally, it comprises companies engaged in crop cultivation, livestock raising, fisheries operations, and nontobacco plantation ownership.

In response, the company said it is ensuring it is significantly hedged and continuing to drive productivity.""The increase in sugar and cocoa specifically is material,"" Mondelez CFO Luca Zaramella said in July. ""We are talking about most likely a 30-plus percent (increase) if you look at the last 12 months, or even more, particularly in cocoa.""But after more than two years of higher prices, retailers are pushing back, analysts said, resulting in a battle that puts chocolatiers' margins and profitability at risk.One such battle resulted in Mondelez previously pulling Cadbury and Milka bars from Belgian supermarket chain Colruyt's shelves after failing to agree on prices.Story continues""I don't know if it's going to be as clear cut as being able to take pricing wherever they want,"" Barclays analyst Patrick Folan said.STARTING TO TRADE DOWNChocolate makers are banking on the traditional resilience of their product to price increases. Mondelez raised its annual revenue growth forecasts last month while Hershey hiked its profit forecast.""Now that pricing is 100% secured, we expect volume and revenue growth, as well as margin improvement for Europe,"" Zaramella said, after Mondelez resolved its spat with Colruyt.However, Mondelez' chocolate sales volume growth has weakened substantially this year – from 14.8% in the 4 weeks to Feb. 25 to 3.2% in the 4 weeks to July 15 year-on-year – even as it kept its price rises in the low double digits, according to a Bernstein analysis of Nielsen IQ data seen by Reuters.The data showed Hershey's sales volumes increasingly declined during the period as the company hiked prices.""We are seeing consumers starting to react more than before, I'd be very cautious with price increases,"" said Dan Sadler, a candy expert at U.S.-based market researcher IRI. ""We're seeing consumers starting to trade down.""Barry Callebaut, the world's biggest chocolate maker supplying most major brands including Nestle, doesn't expect any growth in sales volumes this year. It reported last month that volumes fell 2.7% in the nine months ended May 31.Meanwhile, lower priced 'private label' chocolate continues to pick up market share.In the U.S., private label sales volumes grew nearly 9% in the year to mid-June despite near double-digit price rises, IRI data shows.Hershey's already-announced price hikes for the rest of 2023 are in the ""high single digits,"" while those for next year are ""low single digits,"" CEO Michele Buck said in July.Pennsylvania-based Hershey, is hoping that as it eases off the rate of price hikes, its sales volumes will reverse their current downtrend. It is planning to lean on automation to keep its costs of production down, it said.Rabobank says those cost pressures could continue into next year due to the El Nino weather event in West Africa and the lack of alternate producers who can ramp up output quickly.Top cocoa producers Ivory Coast and Ghana have faced drought, excess rains and disease for the past two years. They produce two thirds of the world's cocoa and officials are struggling to help farmers cope with climate conditions. A 2019 'living income' scheme has been largely ineffective.(Additional reporting by Kailyn Rhone in New York; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Elaine Hardcastle)]"

Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images Fortress Investment Group has acquired roughly $1 billion of office loans from Capital One (COF) with an eye toward a turnaround in New York City’s office sector, Commercial Observer has learned. The private lender purchased the loans this week in a move that signifies a “big bet on the rebound of New York City’s office sector,” one source said, with Big Apple office loans accounting for a large chunk of the portfolio, sources told CO. JLL (JLL)‘s Will Sledge and Kyle Kaminski arranged the transaction on behalf of the seller.The loan portfolio’s specifics couldn’t be gleaned, but Capital One’s lending activity in New York City’s office sector includes The Durst Organization’s 855 Avenue of the Americas and 40 Exchange Place. Whether the loans were purchased at par or at a discount also wasn’t clear, but one source said Fortress has a track record of buying loans “at near par.”McLean, Va.-based Capital One reported in its second quarter earnings released on July 20 that it “reclassified $888 million in commercial office real estate loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2023.” The Capital One office loan sale occurred amid challenging market conditions for banks seeking to sell CRE loans, with lenders including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase encountering obstacles in recent months unloading certain debt off their books, Bloomberg reported last week. After all, office loans have been the proverbial hot potato that nobody wants to be left holding — with multifamily and industrial, on the other hand, remaining the belles of the ball when it comes to asset classes — so some sources expressed surprise that Fortress is now leaning in, heavily. On the origination side, Capital One originated $35.7 billion of CRE loan volume for the 12-month period ending on March 15. A prolific agency lender, the firm has been especially active on the multifamily front, providing a $200 million loan package this month to refinance four apartment complexes, totalling 1,300 units, in New York and New Jersey owned by Eagle Rock Properties. Story continuesOfficials for Fortress and Capital One didn’t immediately return requests for comment. Cathy Cunningham contributed to this article’s reporting. Andrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com.Trending Commercial Observer StoriesMoney Never Sleeps: Newmark Is Aiming for the Capital Markets CrownNew York City Offering Some Wiggle Room for Local Law 97 ComplianceMount Sinai to Close Beth Israel Campus After Decline in Patient CountChetrits Under Contract to Buy UES Rental Building for $35M Apollo Lends $90M on Brooklyn Retail Property Anchored by Whole FoodsRead the original story Fortress Makes $1B Bet on NYC Office Rebound With Capital One Loan Portfolio Buy and others by Andrew Coen at Commercial Observer.]"
283,d0fb79d9-d703-3762-b5ff-deb3fc7b38d7,ULTA,2023-08-18,Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-ulta-reports-next-140014647.html,1692280814,STORY,"['ULTA', 'DKS']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.5 billion, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?For Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ulta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $6.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.88, delivering a surprise of +0.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ulta appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.75 per share for the quarter ended July 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.22 billion, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Dick's has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.13%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Dick's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The projection indicates a 78.4% decline from earnings reported in the year-ago period. This omnichannel retailer has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 52.1%, on average.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseKohl's Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Kohl's Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderKohl’s is likely to have borne cost headwinds in the quarter under review. The company’s SG&amp;A expenses included wage cost headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Management expects a year-over-year gross margin decline in the second quarter due to faster goods clearance. It also expects an SG&amp;A expense increase of 3-4% in the second quarter, which includes investments associated with Sephora openings, along with store-related investments.We project an SG&amp;A expense increase of 3.2% in the quarter, wherein we expect a gross margin contraction of 210 basis points.On its first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management stated that it continues to witness softness in the home category. This could be accountable to the fact that the company entered the year with leaner inventories in the home category, which received lesser benefits from Kohl’s clearance activities.That said, management has been focused on enhancing home results by rebuilding its core business and strengthening understated categories like gifting, pet, impulse and outdoor, among others. For the second quarter, we expect home category sales to indicate a slight increase of 0.9% to $506.4 million.Kohl’s has been benefiting from its omnichannel efforts, which include growing its store portfolio and accelerating digital business growth. The company has been benefiting from its strategic framework, which includes enhancing customer experience, simplifying value strategies, undertaking disciplined inventory and expense management and solidifying the balance sheet.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Kohl's this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Kohl's has an Earnings ESP of +5.26% and a Zacks Rank #3.

ULTA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Ulta Beauty is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ULTA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $5.85 per share for ULTA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.84 per share.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.82. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.11. Over the last 12 months, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.68 and as low as 11.81, with a median of 14.33.Investors will also notice that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TXT's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.55. TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.15, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that TXT has a P/B ratio of 2.14. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.76. TXT's P/B has been as high as 2.27 and as low as 1.78, with a median of 2, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.14. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.17.Finally, we should also recognize that TXT has a P/CF ratio of 11.81. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 19.17. Over the past year, TXT's P/CF has been as high as 12.70 and as low as 10.05, with a median of 11.50.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Textron's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

289,0b8d6964-7899-3d86-b2ee-5c9fe90f7845,KO,2023-08-18,10 Best Consumer Staples ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-consumer-staples-etfs-115333465.html,1692359613,STORY,"['PG', 'WMT', 'KO', 'MDLZ', 'ADM']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best consumer staples ETFs to invest in. If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at some more ETFs, go directly to the 5 Best Consumer Staples ETFs.Consumer staples are an integral part of the average person's daily life, encompassing essential items we depend on regularly. These include necessities like food and beverages, personal care items, household and cleaning products such as paper goods, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and cosmetics.As previously mentioned in one of our articles, the consumer staples sector demonstrated remarkable performance in 2022, even in the face of elevated inflation. By December 9, 2022, the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index had achieved a gain of 0.37%, contrasting with the substantial 16.17% decline observed in the S&amp;P 500, as reported earlier.The purchase of consumer staples remains consistent regardless of the economic conditions, with a relatively stable quantity being bought during both prosperous and challenging times. For instance, the data presented by Hargreaves Lansdown reveals a compelling trend. During the height of the stock market's impact due to the coronavirus pandemic, the FTSE All Share Index experienced a substantial drop of 29.5% by March 18, 2020. In stark contrast, within the same timeframe, the consumer staples sector exhibited a significantly milder decline of just 13.24%, underscoring its resilience even in the face of significant market challenges. This sets the consumer staples sector apart from consumer discretionary enterprises like restaurants, hotels, and apparel, as well as consumer durables—durable goods such as furniture and electronics—that are more sensitive to market fluctuations. However, this stability often entails a trade-off, as significant explosive growth prospects are limited. This compromise is the inconspicuous price for enjoying stability during periods of uncertainty. Additionally, in the event of an economic upturn, other market sectors are poised to reap greater benefits compared to this particular industry.Story continuesRisk-averse investors looking to secure their investments against inflation can opt to increasing their exposure to the consumer staples sector by choosing consumer staples ETFs instead of investing in individual consumer staples stocks. A consumer staples ETF is an investment vehicle that focuses on consumer staples equities. ETFs have gained popularity over the years for several reasons. They offer diversification, allowing investors to access a range of stocks through a single investment, eliminating the need to purchase each stock separately. Furthermore, ETFs provide greater stability due to their lower volatility compared to individual stocks.When it comes to discussing the consumer staples industry, it's worth examining the perspective of one of the global giants in the consumer staples sector, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), regarding the industry's prospects for the current year. As stated by its management:These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7.4% reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales.Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year’s elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double-digits in food categories. It’s important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains and grocery continued, including from higher income households as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience.Best Consumer Staples ETFsPhoto by Fikri Rasyid on UnsplashNotable examples of consumer staples ETFs encompass the iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC), among other options.Our MethodologyWe have curated a selection of ETFs that provide access to consumer staples stocks across various market capitalizations, including large-, mid-, and small-cap companies.

The company’s operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Similar to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in.9.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOIn developed markets like North America and Western Europe, Coca-Cola's relatively low elasticities and strong labor markets suggest a stable foundation for growth. The company's response to cost-conscious consumers, who may consider switching to private label brands, includes moderating pricing and offering items on sale to maintain competitiveness.Coca-Cola: Paving the Path to GrowthSource: Coca-Cola's second-quarter earnings releaseAddressing inflation in emerging marketsIn developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, where inflation is more persistent, Coca-Cola leverages its revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization. By adjusting prices to local market inflation and offsetting currency pressures, the company remains adaptable to the diverse economic conditions in these regions.The number of markets facing intense inflation has grown, with five of the top 40 markets experiencing over 20% annual inflation.Marketing efforts and consumer engagementNotably, Coca-Cola's marketing efforts during the quarter, such as the A Recipe for Magic campaign, have helped associate the brand with consumption occasions and local experiences, strengthening consumer connections. The focus on affordability and premiumization has increased basket incidence and volume per trip, while raising the price per liter, contributing to revenue growth.Story continuesSimilarly, the strong engagement of consumers with sparkling flavors like Sprite, Fanta, Fresca and Thums Up indicates significant opportunities for quality leadership in both developed and developing markets. Finally, the success of Sprite's Heat Happens platform highlights the potential of connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experiences.Second-quarter performanceCoca-Cola reported solid organic revenue growth of 11% year over year, driven by a 10% increase in price mix, which indicates the company successfully implemented pricing actions across its operating segments.Notably, the price mix growth reflects the effectiveness of the company's revenue growth management strategies. Coca-Cola's ability to gain value share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in certain markets, such as Turkey, France, Germany, South Korea, India, Australia and Thailand, indicates it is effectively competing and expanding its market presence.Coca-Cola: Paving the Path to GrowthSource: Coca-ColaChallenges and profitabilityWhile organic revenue grew impressively, unit case volume was flat in the second quarter. However, the company's performance in developing and emerging markets, such as India and Brazil, contributed to the overall growth. Coca-Cola faced challenges in certain markets, like the suspension of business in Russia and declines in the U.S. and Spain.Inflationary pressures impacted operations in various regions, especially with commodities like sugar and juice remaining elevated. As inflation moderates in some areas, Coca-Cola's ability to manage commodity costs and pricing strategies will be crucial for maintaining profitability. At the bottom, comparable earnings per share signified year-over-year growth of 11% to 78 cents.Margin expansion and financial flexibilityDespite higher marketing investments and operating costs, Coca-Cola expanded its gross margin to 59% and comparable operating margin by approximately 90 basis points. Favorably, the expansion was mainly driven by strong top-line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations.Coca-Cola: Paving the Path to GrowthSource: Investor presentationMoreover, Coca-Cola's strong balance sheet and net debt leverage below the targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times Ebitda provide the company with financial flexibility for future investments and capital allocation decisions. Currency fluctuations impacted the company's financial performance, leading to approximately 6% currency headwinds. To mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on earnings per share, the company maintains hedge positions and closely monitors exchange rates in different markets.Digital investments and consumer preferencesFinally, Coca-Cola's investments in digitizing its customer base through business-to-business platforms and revenue growth management capabilities have shown promising results. The company's ability to tailor affordability and premiumization propositions to meet evolving consumer preferences has led to volume and value share gains in certain markets.Coca-Cola: Paving the Path to GrowthSource: Coca-ColaUnleashing innovationOver the long term, Coca-Cola is poised to benefit significantly from its strategic initiatives and consumer-centric innovation. It may drive growth, expand market reach and secure a competitive edge for the company.Initiatives like Sprite Lymonade Legacy, Sprite Waterbomb Festival and Joke-in-a-Bottle promotion have helped the company engage with consumers in North America, South Korea and India, respectively. By capitalizing on significant cultural events and leveraging digital platforms like WhatsApp, the company may create deeper connections with its target audience, expanding its market reach and potentially increasing sales.Brand resilience and product innovationBeing recognized as the ""Most Resilient Brand"" by Kantar and adding the greatest number of new households among FMCG brands in 2022 demonstrates Coca-Cola's ability to weather uncertainties and attract new consumers. It bodes well for the long-term sustainability of the company's growth trajectory.By allocating resources to water, sports, coffee and tea, which offer high returns on investment, the company may tap into evolving consumer preferences and capitalize on the growing demand for healthier and functional beverages. Product innovations like Fuze Tea and Vitaminwater, with promising volume and value growth, indicate its focus on consumer-centric product development is paying off.Driving premiumization and exploring new marketsDriving premiumization under the Simply trademark with products like Simply Mixology allows Coca-Cola to cater to consumers' increasing interest in higher-quality and sophisticated beverages. The strong momentum of brands like Fairlife and Body Armor opens up opportunities for the company to further diversify its portfolio and capture additional market share.Positive results from alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, such as Jack and Coke and Schweppes Mojito, demonstrate its willingness to explore new markets and capitalize on emerging trends, potentially unlocking new revenue streams.In the second quarter, Coca-Cola viewed the promotional environment in North America as rational and implemented strategies to balance premiumization, regularity and affordability. The company's current strategy has allowed it to gain both volume and value share in the U.S. market. The company believes its current strategy is effective, enabling it to continue emphasizing affordability and premium offerings to drive growth.Out-of-home consumption has been growing faster than at-home consumption globally, with transactions outpacing volume. Coca-Cola recognizes the importance of private label switching in Europe and the U.S., focusing on water and juices, while colas experience lower switching.Revenue growth management and product developmentThe company's revenue growth management strategy may play a significant role in achieving its financial objectives by balancing premiumization and affordability. This includes offering refillable, small packs and future consumption packs to maintain accessibility while exploring opportunities for premiumization in both European and U.S. markets.Addressing inflation and the cost of goods sold is crucial for the company's profitability. Coca-Cola's ability to adjust pricing based on local inflation in select markets and establish long-term relationships with suppliers and hedging programs helps mitigate the impact of rising costs.Innovative product development and consumer-centric marketing are pivotal to its growth strategy. The company's efforts to reinvigorate iconic brands like Coca-Cola and Minute Maid have resonated with younger consumers, contributing to high single-digit volume growth and overall value share gains in the juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages categories.TakeawayCoca-Cola second-quarter performance reveals robust growth signals in developed markets while navigating inflation challenges in emerging regions. The company's strategic prowess and consumer-centric innovations position it for long-term value creation and sustainable growth.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola Consolidated:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.26 = US$797m ÷ (US$4.0b - US$892m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Coca-Cola Consolidated has an ROCE of 26%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 16% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of Coca-Cola Consolidated, check out these free graphs here.What Can We Tell From Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCE Trend?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Coca-Cola Consolidated. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 26%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 28%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Coca-Cola Consolidated's ROCETo sum it up, Coca-Cola Consolidated has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 331% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. In light of that, from a first glance at DaVita (NYSE:DVA), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for DaVita, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.087 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$17b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, DaVita has an ROCE of 8.7%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 9.7% average generated by the Healthcare industry. View our latest analysis for DaVita roceIn the above chart we have measured DaVita's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering DaVita here  for free.So How Is DaVita's ROCE Trending?There is reason to be cautious about DaVita, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 11% that they were earning five years ago. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on DaVita becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOn a related note, DaVita has decreased its current liabilities to 14% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.What We Can Learn From DaVita's ROCEAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. However the stock has delivered a 45% return to shareholders over the last five years, so investors might be expecting the trends to turn around. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere.One final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with DaVita (including 1 which is concerning) .While DaVita may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

296,17bcb06f-5918-3c88-b485-0d11cc316610,WHR,2023-08-18,Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $1.75,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whirlpool-nyse-whr-affirmed-dividend-100316730.html,1692352996,STORY,['WHR'],"[The board of Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $1.75 per share on the 15th of September. This means the annual payment is 5.2% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool Whirlpool's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Even though Whirlpool isn't generating a profit, it is generating healthy free cash flows that easily cover the dividend. This gives us some comfort about the level of the dividend payments.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 6.9%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWhirlpool Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.00 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $7.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Whirlpool's EPS has declined at around 13% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.In SummaryOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Whirlpool (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing.

With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Sempra, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Sempra ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sempra?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Sempra does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sempra's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sempra. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SempraWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Sempra insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$14m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Sempra. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Sempra has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) must be dismayed after prices dropped by 5.4% last week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-ge-healthcare-technologies-120020291.html,1692360020,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies GE HealthCare Technologies' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 7 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And following last week's 5.4% decline in share price, institutional suffered the most losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about GE HealthCare Technologies. See our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.GE HealthCare Technologies already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at GE HealthCare Technologies' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. GE HealthCare Technologies is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is General Electric Company, with ownership of 14%. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 8.5% of the company stock.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare TechnologiesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$52m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over GE HealthCare Technologies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 14% of GE HealthCare Technologies. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with GE HealthCare Technologies .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund boss and the stock market in general, then take a look at Stanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stocks. The high interest rate environment which started to take shape last year has not been great for the hedge fund industry. Most funds tend to do well when the stock market as a whole is rising, but the energy supply shocks of 2023 effectively bifurcated the stock market into two segments. These included growth stocks that fell as inflation rose and purchasing powers dropped, and traditional sectors such as petroleum, gas, and coal which rose as investors tried to profit from an effective reworking of the global energy market.The fall in the grace of growth stocks last year also took down several hedge funds with it. As a whole, the industry lost $208 billion in 2022, with funds such as Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global and Dan Loeb's Third Point Capital losing more than $20 billion cumulatively.

Mr. Druckenmiller has decades of experience in the finance industry, and he set up his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, in 1981. He is also one of the most famous hedge fund investors in the history of the industry. While some of our readers might only be young enough to remember the British Pound's crash last year that nearly sent it to parity levels with the U.S. dollar, the British currency underwent similarly rapid depreciations in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Mr. Druckenmiller, working for George Soros at that time, capitalized on the latter when they correctly bet that the British government would be forced to devalue the Pound in 1992 and fail to meet the conditions for the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This netted them more than a billion dollars in profit.Story continuesThe hedge fund investor has since retired from managing investor capital after he closed down his fund in 2010 stating that the job became too stressful. Currently, he invests in the stock market through his family office, which also leaves him insulated against large scale capital withdrawal from hedge funds during times of crisis in the stock market such as the one that took place last year and in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus breakout.However, even though he has chosen to step back from the lucrative world of hedge fund investing, Mr. Druckenmiller still has his fingers on the pulse of the industry. 2023's first half has been a stunner for industry observers and investors, as, despite an uncertain U.S. economic outlook and high interest rates, indexes such as the NASDAQ 100, have posted stunning gains that have touched 45%. Much of these have been due to the hype in artificial intelligence. Speaking at an event in June, he shared insightful thoughts about artificial intelligence and its prospects, particularly during a potential recession.According to him:All of AI is not going to make it through whether we have a recession or not because they haven't separated the wheat from the chaff yet. But I do believe, unlike crypto, I think AI is real, it's probably, it could be as transformative as the Internet, it's a huge thing. And I think I've argued publicly that if staples can go up in price in a recession, why can't a company like NVIDIA if they go up; if they go up if their orders and earnings go up 70% in a hard landing - which is what I think would probably happen. It's not clear that NVIDIA goes down despite the lofty valuation level. History has proved that if you do, that if you have very good earnings in a recession, and they're sustainable, if they're not the market somehow figures it out, those stocks would do just fine. So we have some longs, we have some shorts, and the AI's sort of dominated the long portfolio for five or six months.So, what are Stanley Druckenmiller's latest investments?

Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.

Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as to the extent required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation:Risk Factors Related to the Current Economic EnvironmentContinued rising interest rates in the current economic environment may adversely impact our cost to borrow, real estate valuation, and stock price. Current economic challenges, including the potential for recession, may adversely impact our tenants and our business. Unfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition, and overall results of operations.Risk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health CrisesPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping CentersEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A percentage of our revenues are derived from “local” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if these tenants are not successful, or if the demand for the types or mix of tenants significantly change. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other building, fire, and safety and regulations may have a material negative effect on us.Risk Factors Related to Real Estate InvestmentsOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our PropertiesClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.Risk Factors Related to Corporate MattersAn increased focus on metrics and reporting relating to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint VenturesWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital StructureOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.

(NYSE: EL) today reported net sales of $15.91 billion for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 10% from $17.74 billion in the prior year. Organic net sales fell 6%, primarily driven by Asia travel retail in Hainan and Korea, partially offset by growth in nearly every market in both Asia/Pacific and Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa (""EMEA""). Total organic net sales in the Company’s emerging markets2 and in Fragrance each rose double digits.The Company reported net earnings3 of $1.01 billion, compared with net earnings of $2.39 billion in the prior year. Diluted net earnings per common share was $2.79, compared with $6.55 reported in the prior year. Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed on page 3, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share was $3.46, a 49% decrease in constant currency. The reported and adjusted declines include an unfavorable impact of 5% and 4%, respectively, from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations.Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer said, ""We returned to organic sales growth in the fourth quarter, delivering our outlook. Momentum continued in the markets of EMEA and Latin America, and accelerated strongly in Asia/Pacific led by mainland China and Hong Kong SAR.For full-year fiscal 2023, we delivered organic sales growth and prestige beauty share gains in many developed and emerging markets, but Asia travel retail pressured results, particularly in Skin Care, and we continued to experience softness in North America. Fragrance excelled, up double digits in every region, and Makeup improved sequentially to double-digit growth in the fourth quarter as more markets emerged into the post-pandemic era.Story continues1 Organic net sales represents net sales excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP measure of organic net sales growth provides year-over-year sales comparisons on a consistent basis. See page 3 for reconciliations to GAAP.2 The Company’s emerging markets are India, the Middle East, Turkey, South Africa, Central Europe, Israel, Russia, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru and Argentina.3 Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. which excludes net earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.For fiscal year 2024, we expect to return to organic sales growth and deliver sequentially improving margin throughout the year, leveraging the strong equity and desirability of our brands. We are focused on driving momentum in markets that are thriving and re-accelerating growth in North America. In Asia travel retail, we are taking actions to capture demand from the returning individual travelers and continuing to reduce inventories in the trade as we navigate the current market headwinds. In this new fiscal year, we also intend to set the stage for a stronger fiscal year 2025 acceleration, with a very robust innovation pipeline planned across the two years and progressive margin rebuilding plans.""Business UpdateIn the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, net sales returned to growth, increasing 1% on a reported basis and 4% organically, reflecting growth in Makeup, Fragrance and Hair Care as well as double-digit growth in the Company’s emerging markets globally. The decline in Skin Care net sales primarily reflected the ongoing challenges in the Company’s Asia travel retail business. Net sales grew in nearly all markets in Asia/Pacific and EMEA as they continued to progress in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and benefited from the Company’s strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities, innovation and targeted expanded consumer reach.For the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the operating environment continued to be disrupted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most notably, the pace of recovery in Asia travel retail and mainland China was slower than anticipated. In Hainan, prolonged store closures initially presented a headwind and, thereafter, low levels of conversion occurred when travel resumed. This was compounded by inventory tightening by certain retailers. In Korea, the travel retail business slowed during the transition to post-COVID regulations. In addition, the slower than anticipated resumption of international flights, granting of visas, and organized group tours further challenged the Asia travel retail recovery. As a result, the Company’s Asia travel retail business was challenged throughout the fiscal year by the slower than anticipated recovery. In mainland China, the Company’s performance in the first half of fiscal 2023 was hindered by low retail traffic as a result of COVID-related restrictions and the rise in COVID-19 cases.Elsewhere, the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic progressed across markets globally over the course of the fiscal year as restrictions lifted. In the West, the Company’s recovery from the pandemic continued with strong organic net sales growth in nearly all markets in EMEA and in Latin America. In Asia/Pacific, the Company’s markets emerged strongly into recovery across the fiscal year, to deliver broad-based organic net sales growth throughout the region.In the United States, organic net sales growth was unfavorably impacted by the slower than anticipated pace of the Company’s improvement at retail and the tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the first half of fiscal 2023 due to inflationary pressures and recession concerns.Finally, the Company’s business was also pressured by the strong U.S. dollar, inflation and recession concerns globally.Fiscal 2023 ResultsReported net sales decreased 10%, including the net impact of the fiscal 2022 license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances and royalty revenue from the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter acquisition of the TOM FORD brand, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency translation.Royalty revenue from the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand is reflected in the Other product category and in The Americas region net sales. The acquisition was $.01 dilutive to earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2023, which includes higher interest expense and savings from royalty payments no longer owed by the Company.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP Net Sales Growth(Unaudited)Year EndedJune 30, 2023(1)As Reported-GAAP(10)%Impact of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, net1Impact of foreign currency translation4Returns associated with restructuring and other activities—Organic, Non-GAAP(6)%(1)Percentages are calculated on an individual basisAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share excludes restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed in the following table.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP - Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")(Unaudited)Year Ended June 3020232022GrowthAs Reported EPS - GAAP$2.79$6.55(57)%Non-GAAPRestructuring and other charges.18.31Change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options (less the portion attributable toredeemable noncontrolling interest).05(.12)Other intangible asset impairments.44.50Adjusted EPS - Non-GAAP$3.46$7.24(52)%Impact of foreign currency translation on earnings per share.26Adjusted Constant Currency EPS - Non-GAAP$3.72$7.24(49)%Net sales and operating income in nearly all of the Company’s product categories and regions were impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.

Net sales declined for Estée Lauder, La Mer and Dr.Jart+, partially offset by strong growth from The Ordinary, M·A·C and Bobbi Brown Cosmetics.Estée Lauder, La Mer and Dr.Jart+ net sales declined, primarily due to the challenges in Asia travel retail. Net sales from Estée Lauder and La Mer increased in Asia/Pacific, benefiting from Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ franchise line of products and The Moisturizing Soft Cream from La Mer.Strong double-digit net sales growth from The Ordinary reflected growth across every region and benefited from the continued strength from hero products, successful innovation, such as New!

The Company aims to return to net sales growth in fiscal year 2024 and over the next few years progressively rebuild its margins. It also plans to continue to strategically invest in areas to support recovery, share gains and long-term profitable growth. These investments include innovation, advertising, accelerating retail growth in its Asia travel retail business, growth of its emerging markets and the completion of its first manufacturing facility in Asia, located in Japan, to support the development of the Asia/Pacific region. The Company is mindful of the headwinds that have emerged in China’s economy.

Contraction in the first half of fiscal 2024 is expected to be more than offset by expansion in the second half.Sequential operating margin improvement quarterly throughout fiscal 2024, with greater expansion in the second half of fiscal year 2024 due to the cadence of the improvement of the Asia travel retail business.The cybersecurity incident is expected to have an immaterial impact to net sales and a dilutive impact to net earnings per common share of approximately $.07 for the fiscal 2024 first quarter and full year.Full-year effective tax rate of approximately 27%.Net cash flows provided by operating activities are forecast to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, assuming the Company achieves the results described below.Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 6% of projected sales to support supply chain investments, as well as continued investments in customer facing capital, including stores and online, and information technology.Quarterly dividend remains at the current amount and the share repurchase program remains suspended as the Company focuses on deleveraging post the TOM FORD acquisition and prepares for the remaining payment for DECIEM anticipated in May 2024.The Company continues to monitor the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; currency volatility; inflationary pressures; supply chain challenges; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues.

The PCBA Program will help improve efficiency and effectiveness by rebalancing resources to growth areas of prestige beauty. It will further strengthen the Company by building upon the foundational capabilities in which the Company has invested. The PCBA Program’s main areas of focus include accelerating the shift to online with the realignment of the Company’s distribution network reflecting freestanding store and certain department store closures, with a focus on North America and Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa; the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of the Company’s regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. This program is expected to position the Company to better execute its long-term strategy while strengthening its financial flexibility. The Company approved specific initiatives under the PCBA Program through fiscal 2022 and has substantially completed those initiatives through fiscal 2023. As of June 30, 2023, the Company expects that the PCBA Program will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $450 million and $480 million, before taxes.(B)For the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $24 million ($19 million, less the portion attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest and net of tax, or $.05 per common share) and $22 million ($17 million, less the portion attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest and net of tax, or $.05 per common share), respectively, of expense related to the change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options related to DECIEM. For the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded $3 million ($3 million, less portion attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest and net of tax, or $.01 per common share) and $(55) million ($(43) million, less the portion attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest and net of tax, or ($.12), respectively, of expense (income) related to the change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options related to DECIEM.C)During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, given the lower-than-expected results in the overall business, the Company revised the internal forecasts relating to its Smashbox reporting unit. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. The remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $21 million reducing the carrying value to zero.During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company revised the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022.The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $100 million for Dr.Jart+ and $86 million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair values of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted-average cost of capital, which was 11% and 13%, respectively.For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, other intangible asset impairment charges were $207 million ($159 million, net of tax), with an impact of $.44 per common share.During the fiscal 2022 third quarter, given the lower-than-expected results from international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its GLAMGLOW reporting unit. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset.During the fiscal 2022 third quarter, given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels for Dr.Jart+ that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants and resurgence in cases and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the brand, the lower than expected growth in key retail channels for DECIEM, and the lower than expected results from international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for Too Faced, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+, DECIEM and Too Faced reporting units.The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s, DECIEM’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of February 28, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. For the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit, the Company also concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge. For the Too Faced and DECIEM reporting units, as the carrying values of the trademarks did not exceed their estimated fair values the Company did not record impairment charges. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+, DECIEM and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units.During the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, based on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ trademark exceeded its fair value. This determination was made based on updated internal forecasts. Given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continued to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, the resurgence in cases, regional lockdowns and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the brand, we made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets were recoverable. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized other intangible asset impairment charges of $25 million ($19 million, net of tax, or $.05 per common share) relating to the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit.The total other intangible asset impairment charges recorded for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 were $241 million ($183 million, net of tax), with an impact of $.50 per common share.Returns and Charges Associated With Restructurin...g and Other Activities and Other Adjustments(Unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30, 2023SalesReturnsCost ofSalesOperating ExpensesTotalAfterRedeemableNoncontrollingInterest and TaxDilutedEPS(In millions, except per share data)RestructuringChargesOther Charges/AdjustmentsLeading Beauty Forward$—$—$—$3$3$1$—PCBA Program1742354940.11Change in fair value of acquisition-related stockoptions———242419.05Total$17$4$23$32$76$60$.16Year Ended June 30, 2023SalesReturnsCost ofSalesOperating ExpensesTotalAfterRedeemableNoncontrollingInterest and TaxDilutedEPS(In millions, except per share data)RestructuringChargesOther Charges/AdjustmentsLeading Beauty Forward$—$—$1$7$8$6$.02PCBA Program27335127760.16Change in fair value of acquisition-related stockoptions———222217.05Other intangible asset impairments———207207159.44Total$27$3$36$248$314$242$.67Three Months Ended June 30, 2022SalesReturnsCost ofSalesOperating ExpensesTotalAfterRedeemableNoncontrollingInterest and TaxDilutedEPS(In millions, except per share data)RestructuringChargesOther Charges/AdjustmentsLeading Beauty Forward$—$—$1$3$4$3$.01PCBA Program178539676.21Change in fair value of acquisition-related stockoptions———333.01Other intangible asset impairments———252519.05Total$1$7$86$34$128$101$.28Year Ended June 30, 2022SalesReturnsCost ofSalesOperating ExpensesTotalAfterRedeemableNoncontrollingInterest and TaxDilutedEPS(In millions, except per share data)RestructuringChargesOther Charges/AdjustmentsLeading Beauty Forward$—$2$(1)$16$17$13$.04PCBA Program451099127100.27Change in fair value of acquisition-related stockoptions———(55)(55)(43)(.12)Other intangible asset impairments———241241183.50Other income———(1)(1)(1)—Total$4$7$108$210$329$252$.69Results by Product Category(Unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30Net SalesPercentage Change(1)OperatingIncome (Loss)PercentageChange($ in millions)20232022ReportedBasisImpact ofAcquisitions,Divestituresand BrandClosures, NetImpact ofForeignCurrencyTranslationOrganicNet Sales(Non-GAAP)20232022ReportedBasisSkin Care$1,794$1,883(5)%—%2%(3)%$(3)$287(100+%)Makeup1,10899312—21314(95)100+Fragrance545521562124110100+Hair Care1641565—16(3)(20)85Other15967(100+)—(60)(2)(3)33Subtotal$3,626$3,5622%—%2%4%$47$179(74)%Returns/chargesassociated withrestructuring andother activities(17)(1)(52)(100)Total$3,609$3,5611%—%2%4%$(5)$79(100+%)(1)Percentages are calculated on an individual basisResults by Geographic Region(Unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30Net SalesPercentage Change(1)OperatingIncome (Loss)PercentageChange($ in millions)20232022ReportedBasisImpact ofAcquisitions,Divestituresand BrandClosures, NetImpact ofForeignCurrencyTranslationOrganicNet Sales(Non-GAAP)20232022ReportedBasisThe Americas$1,071$1,076—%—%—%—%$(20)$115(100+%)Europe, theMiddle East &amp;Africa1,2531,480(15)1—(15)(76)(6)(100+)Asia/Pacific1,3021,00629—63614370100+Subtotal$3,626$3,5622%—%2%4%$47$179(74)%Returns/chargesassociated withrestructuring andother activities(17)(1)(52)(100)Total$3,609$3,5611%—%2%4%$(5)$79(100+%)(1)Percentages are calculated on an individual basisThis earnings release includes some non-GAAP financial measures relating to charges associated with restructuring and other activities and adjustments, as well as organic net sales. Included herein are reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures for certain consolidated statements of earnings accounts before and after these items. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate its operating performance, which represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period-to-period, or do not reflect the Company’s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze operating performance from period to period. In the future, the Company expects to incur charges or make adjustments similar in nature to those presented herein; however, the impact to the Company’s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the Company’s results of operations. Therefore, the Company presents certain net sales, operating results and diluted earnings per share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of its underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current-period results using prior-year period monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities.Reconciliation of Certain Consolidated Statements of Earnings AccountsBefore and After Returns, Charges and Other Adjustments(Unaudited)Three Months Ended June 3020232022% Change($ in millions, except pershare data)AsReportedReturns/Charges/AdjustmentsNon-GAAPImpact ofForeignCurrencyTranslationNon-GAAP,ConstantCurrencyAsReportedReturns/Charges/AdjustmentsNon-GAAPNon-GAAPNon-GAAP,ConstantCurrencyNet sales$3,609$17$3,626$64$3,690$3,561$1$3,5622%4%Gross profit2,446212,467502,5172,53082,538(3)%(1)%Operating (loss)income(5)7671188979128207(66)%(57)%Diluted EPS$(.09)$.16$.07$.04$.11$.14$.28$.42(82)%(75)%Reconciliation of Certain Consolidated Statements of Earnings AccountsBefore and After Returns, Charges and Other Adjustments(Unaudited)Year Ended June 3020232022% Change($ in millions, except pershare data)AsReportedReturns/Charges/AdjustmentsNon-GAAPImpact ofForeignCurrencyTranslationNon-GAAP,ConstantCurrencyAsReportedReturns/Charges/AdjustmentsNon-GAAPNon-GAAPNon-GAAP,ConstantCurrencyNet sales$15,910$27$15,937$629$16,566$17,737$4$17,741(10)%(7)%Gross profit11,3463011,37649211,86813,4321113,443(15)%(12)%Operating income1,5093141,8231261,9493,1703303,500(48)%(44)%Diluted EPS$2.79$.67$3.46$.26$3.72$6.55$.69$7.24(52)%(49)%CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Unaudited, except where noted)June 30,2023June 30,2022($ in millions)(Audited)ASSETSCash and cash equivalents$4,029$3,957Accounts receivable, net1,4521,629Inventory and promotional merchandise2,9792,920Prepaid expenses and other current assets679792Total current assets9,1399,298Property, plant and equipment, net3,1792,650Operating lease right-of-use assets1,7971,949Other assets9,3007,013Total assets$23,415$20,910LIABILITIES AND EQUITYCurrent debt$997$268Accounts payable1,6701,822Operating lease liabilities357365Other accrued liabilities3,2163,360Total current liabilities6,2405,815Long-term debt7,1175,144Long-term operating lease liabilities1,6981,868Other noncurrent liabilities1,9431,651Total noncurrent liabilities10,7588,663Redeemable noncontrolling interest832842Total equity5,5855,590Total liabilities and equity$23,415$20,910SELECT CASH FLOW DATA(Unaudited, except where noted)Twelve Months EndedJune 30($ in millions)20232022(Audited)Net earnings$1,010$2,408Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash flows from operatingactivities:Depreciation and amortization744727Deferred income taxes(186)(149)Other intangible asset impairments207241Other items312367Changes in operating assets and liabilities:Decrease (increase) in accounts receivable, net185(10)Increase in inventory and promotional merchandise(64)(602)Decrease (increase) in other assets, net26(101)Increase (decrease) in accounts payable and other liabilities(503)159Net cash flows provided by operating activities$1,731$3,040Other Investing and Financing Sources (Uses):Capital expenditures$(1,003)$(1,040)Settlement of net investment hedges80108Purchases of other intangible assets(2,286)—Payments for acquired businesses, net of cash acquired—(3)Purchases of investments(8)(10)Payments to acquire treasury stock(271)(2,309)Dividends paid(925)(840)Proceeds (repayments) of current debt, net983(4)Proceeds (repayments) of long-term debt, net1,730(18)View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230818019446/en/ContactsInvestors: Rainey Mancini rmancini@estee.comMedia: Jill Marvin jimarvin@estee.com]"

320,0b8d6964-7899-3d86-b2ee-5c9fe90f7845,PG,2023-08-18,10 Best Consumer Staples ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-consumer-staples-etfs-115333465.html,1692359613,STORY,"['PG', 'WMT', 'KO', 'MDLZ', 'ADM']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best consumer staples ETFs to invest in. If you want to skip our detailed introduction of the consumer staples industry and just want to take a look at some more ETFs, go directly to the 5 Best Consumer Staples ETFs.Consumer staples are an integral part of the average person's daily life, encompassing essential items we depend on regularly. These include necessities like food and beverages, personal care items, household and cleaning products such as paper goods, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and cosmetics.As previously mentioned in one of our articles, the consumer staples sector demonstrated remarkable performance in 2022, even in the face of elevated inflation. By December 9, 2022, the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Select Sector index had achieved a gain of 0.37%, contrasting with the substantial 16.17% decline observed in the S&amp;P 500, as reported earlier.The purchase of consumer staples remains consistent regardless of the economic conditions, with a relatively stable quantity being bought during both prosperous and challenging times. For instance, the data presented by Hargreaves Lansdown reveals a compelling trend. During the height of the stock market's impact due to the coronavirus pandemic, the FTSE All Share Index experienced a substantial drop of 29.5% by March 18, 2020. In stark contrast, within the same timeframe, the consumer staples sector exhibited a significantly milder decline of just 13.24%, underscoring its resilience even in the face of significant market challenges. This sets the consumer staples sector apart from consumer discretionary enterprises like restaurants, hotels, and apparel, as well as consumer durables—durable goods such as furniture and electronics—that are more sensitive to market fluctuations. However, this stability often entails a trade-off, as significant explosive growth prospects are limited. This compromise is the inconspicuous price for enjoying stability during periods of uncertainty. Additionally, in the event of an economic upturn, other market sectors are poised to reap greater benefits compared to this particular industry.Story continuesRisk-averse investors looking to secure their investments against inflation can opt to increasing their exposure to the consumer staples sector by choosing consumer staples ETFs instead of investing in individual consumer staples stocks. A consumer staples ETF is an investment vehicle that focuses on consumer staples equities. ETFs have gained popularity over the years for several reasons. They offer diversification, allowing investors to access a range of stocks through a single investment, eliminating the need to purchase each stock separately. Furthermore, ETFs provide greater stability due to their lower volatility compared to individual stocks.When it comes to discussing the consumer staples industry, it's worth examining the perspective of one of the global giants in the consumer staples sector, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), regarding the industry's prospects for the current year. As stated by its management:These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher. At our Investor Day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart U.S. comp sales were strong, up 7.4% reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth and store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales.Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories including lawn and garden. Gross margins decreased 41 basis points primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year’s elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double-digits in food categories. It’s important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains and grocery continued, including from higher income households as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience.Best Consumer Staples ETFsPhoto by Fikri Rasyid on UnsplashNotable examples of consumer staples ETFs encompass the iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:KXI), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP), and Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSEARCA:VDC), among other options.Our MethodologyWe have curated a selection of ETFs that provide access to consumer staples stocks across various market capitalizations, including large-, mid-, and small-cap companies. This compilation aims to encompass a comprehensive array of well-regarded funds listed on US exchanges. Moreover, we have mentioned the top holdings of these ETFs, which includes the likes of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), to provide more insight to prospective investors. Notably, these energy ETFs have achieved noteworthy growth over the past 5 years. The list is organized in ascending order based on the 5-year performance as of August 14, 2023.Best Consumer Staples ETFs10. iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 18.75%The iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI) replicates the performance of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Consumer Staples Sector Index. This consumer staples-oriented ETF provides investors with the opportunity to invest in businesses located across diverse countries, including the United States, Switzerland, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The encompassed companies comprise food manufacturers, distributors, producers of nondurable household goods, and enterprises involved in food and drug retailing. Established in August 2018, the fund currently manages assets worth $1.483 billion.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the top stocks in iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:KXI)’s portfolio. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stands as a multinational consumer goods corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was established in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The corporation offers branded consumer packaged goods on a global scale, functioning through distinct segments including Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. During fiscal Q3 2023, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) recorded a 3.5% year-over-year growth in revenue, amounting to $20.07 billion. The company’s operating cash flow for the quarter reached approximately $4 billion, and its cash flow productivity was at an impressive 92%.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Similar to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in.9. Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 21.34%The basis of the Invesco DWA Consumer Staples Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PSL) lies in the Dorsey Wright® Consumer Staples Technical Leaders Index.

Cosmetics, e.l.f. Skin, Well People, and Keys Soulcare. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) anticipates net sales for fiscal 2024 to fall within the bracket of $705 million to $720 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $637.72 million. Similarly, the projected range for adjusted diluted earnings per share is set at $1.73 to $1.76, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.64.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines (IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF). Shares of value-oriented beauty brand ELF received a meaningful boost from normalizing beauty usage and spending in a post-COVID environment, which we believe has contributed to its premium multiple relative to competitors in the beauty space. As this temporary lift unwinds, we expect elf’s valuation to similarly return to a level better aligned with its product offerings.”8. Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC)5-Year Performance as of August 14: 30.06%The foundation of the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) lies in the S&amp;P SmallCap 600® Capped Consumer Staples Index.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.14 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on August 23, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.14 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.13 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has an Earnings ESP of 12%.ANF is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).O'Reilly Automotive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 25, 2023. ORLY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $10.26 a share 69 days from its next earnings release.O'Reilly Automotive's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.4% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.22.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ANF and ORLY could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

It’s reasonable to assume profit-takers have begun to show, reflecting healthy price action following the blistering-hot run.During times of market weakness, investors can benefit by targeting low-beta stocks, as they’re less susceptible to the general market’s movements.And for those interested, three low-beta stocks – Arch Capital Group ACGL, Aflac AFL, and T-Mobile US TMUS – could be considered.

It also takes care of intricacies which crop up amid such procedures and might consume significant time and resources of employers. The platform’s effectiveness enables employers to intensify focus on growing business or cater to the needs of the workforce.The tool can be easily accessed via web portal or email without the need to enter any login credentials. The GUIDEcx platform also acts a collaborative space wherein employers can connect with their administrative squad for allocating tasks.Considering the interactive nature of the platform, employees can stay connected with their group benefits provider during the onboarding experience and enjoy prompt access to key workplace benefits. The Group Protection segment of Lincoln National is expected to benefit from the new tool launch. Through the unit, LNC distributes non-medical insurance products via employee-paid and employer-paid plans. The insurer remains on a spree to upgrade its workplace benefits offerings, which in turn, boosts the lucrativeness and sales of such offerings. Also, a stable financial future awaits employees if they get access to effective workplace benefits. Needless to say, higher sale of insurance policies in the Group Protection unit of Lincoln National fetches improved premiums, which remains the most significant contributor to an insurer’s top line. Insurance premiums rose 6.7% year over year in the first half of 2023.The recent initiative can also be termed as a time opportune move on the part of LNC, taking two points into consideration. Enhanced benefits offerings are a vital component of talent acquisition and retention in the workplace, which therefore makes a seamless onboarding experience a dire need. Also, unveiling a digital tool seems aptly timed amid the ongoing digitization inflicted across every sphere of life.Story continuesAs a further testament to efforts of advancing workplace benefits, Lincoln National launched a financial wellness marketplace last year in collaboration with the well-known student debt management platform, Candidly, to provide student debt solutions and add strength to the financial wellness program of Lincoln National.Shares of Lincoln National have gained 20.8% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s 3.4% growth.

(NASDAQ:REGN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.21bUS$4.41bUS$4.97bUS$5.58bUS$6.00bUS$6.35bUS$6.65bUS$6.91bUS$7.15bUS$7.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 7.45%Est @ 5.86%Est @ 4.75%Est @ 3.97%Est @ 3.42%Est @ 3.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$4.2kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$42bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$188bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$188b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$104bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$146b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$797, the company appears quite undervalued at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

337,75987d61-4c06-3694-9c17-aeba6516224f,GPS,2023-08-18,Gap (GPS) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-gps-earnings-expected-grow-140015327.html,1692280815,STORY,"['ANF', 'GPS']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Gap (GPS) reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis clothing chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.6 billion, down 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.58% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gap?For Gap, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +71.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Gap will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gap would post a loss of $0.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of +105.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Gap appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the quarter ended July 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +143.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $840.97 million, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Abercrombie has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 12.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Abercrombie will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GPS may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Gap is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GPS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 16 cents per share for GPS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GPS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +71.25% heading into earnings season.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that GPS has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Gap, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Never be left in the dust again.Cisco tops expectations; analysts mixedCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares climbed 3.3% Thursday after the tech behemoth sailed past Wall Street expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter thanks to a growing enterprise appetite for AI, security, and cloud.The company said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.14 - $0.08 better than consensus - on revenue of $15.2 billion which edged past the $15.05B average target.Earnings guidance for Q1 topped expectations at $1.02 to $1.04 per share - the Street was looking for $0.99 - and revenue of $14.5B to $14.7B was in line with targets. Full-year expectations were for earnings of $4.01 to $4.08 per share on sales of $57B to $58.2B; analysts were seeking $4.04 per share on $58.4B in revenue.CEO Chuck Robbins said on the earnings call that Cisco is poised for ""further share gains"" in campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing, having gained ""over 3 percentage points of market share"" vs. the prior year in those key areas, and believes the company is ""super well positioned"" on AI.Following these results, analysts at BofA, Citi, and KeyBanc all kept their neutral ratings on the stock.BofA and KeyBanc highlighted the company's solid execution and innovation, but BofA sees ""additional risk to estimates"" given a ""diminishing backlog contribution"" that would necessitate a ""significant order recovery throughout F24, which might not materialize."" And KeyBanc is staying neutral until it sees ""move consistent consistent signs of share gains and improved visibility into F2H24 order growth ramp.""Citi similarly said it is staying on the sidelines until it sees further market share gains in ""switch and security,"" adding that Cisco's talk of AI share gains was ""encouraging,"" but ""we await third party data verification to get more excited about share gains.""Story continuesEvercore, however, maintained its Outperform rating on Cisco and raised the target price by $3 to $63, arguing that the fiscal 2024 guidance is ""fairly conservative with room for upside"" across multiple segments. It also believes the company's commitment to ""showing operating leverage,"" and more consistent share buyback of some $1.5B quarterly, ""will resonate with investors and provide higher predictability for CSCO shareholders going forward.""Cisco shares closed Thursday at $54.73.Walmart beats, shares still slipThanks to a surfeit of budget-conscious shoppers, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said Q2 same-store sales (excluding gas) rose 6.3% from the prior year, better than the 4% estimates, and the world's largest retailer also boosted its full-year guidance.The company now sees full-year adjusted EPS at $6.36 to $6.46, well ahead of its prior range of $6.10 to $6.20. Analysts polled by InvestingPro were looking for an average of $6.28. And its top line is projected to grow by about 4% to 4.5% in all of fiscal 2024, up from the prior estimate of some 3.5%.Walmart also said Q2 earnings totaled $1.84 per share, beating the $1.69 Street expectation.Still, shares slipped 2.2% Thursday after a jump in premarket trading.CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement that Walmart's food segment had been a source of ""strength"" for the group in the 13 weeks ended on July 29. Groceries have been a key performance driver for Walmart during a recent bout of elevated inflation in the U.S., helping the business overcome a broader pullback in spending on nonessential items that has hit peers like DIY chain Home Depot and big-box firm Target.Shares ended Thursday at $155.69.Target results better than fearedMeanwhile, a day earlier, Walmart-rival Target (NYSE:TGT) saw shares rise 3% on a guidance revision that was less egregious than feared.Target's Q2 comps slid 5.4%, worse than the expected 3.8% decline. Revenue reached $24.8B, a decrease of 4.9% compared with $25.33B in the prior year.Gross margin improved to 27%, surpassing last year's 21.5% and exceeding the estimated 25.6%.Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.80, easily ahead of the expected $1.47.For Q3, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.60, well under the $1.84 consensus, while also lowering EPS estimates by $0.75 to a range of $7 to $8. Analysts were widely expecting Target to lower its guidance, and the delivered cut was seen by the market as better than feared.RBC also said the guidance ""could be conservative as mgmt looks to set a floor. All in all, barring any negative surprises on current comp trends, we think there's enough here to get shares moving in the right direction.""Citi also noted the recent negative sentiment around the stock, which explained the sigh of relief from the market regarding its guidance revision.Target shares closed Wednesday at $128.75.Home Depot tops consensusHome Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) posted Q2 comps, net sales, and EPS declines that were less steep than anticipated on Tuesday.Comparable-store sales were down 2% vs. Wall Street expectations for a 4.1% decline, and its top line was down 2% from the prior year to $42.9B, but analysts were looking for $42.1B. EPS came to $4.65, a slide from last year's $5.05 but better than the $4.46 consensus.Home Depot maintained its outlook for the fiscal year 2024, expecting comps to fall in a range of 2% to 5% and an EPS decline of 7% to 13%.CEO Ted Decker acknowledged ""continued pressure in certain big-ticket, discretionary categories"" even amid strength in categories associated with smaller home-improvement projects, adding, ""We remain very positive on the medium-to-long term outlook for home improvement and our ability to grow share in a large and fragmented market.”Shares traded up fractionally to $332.14 on Tuesday.Applied Materials trounces guidance expectationsFinally, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) delivered blowout earnings guidance after the bell Thursday after fiscal third-quarter results beat analyst estimates as the ongoing enterprise race to join the digital and AI era supported chip demand and bolstered growth.Fiscal Q4 adjusted EPS is expected at $1.82 to $2.18, smashing the consensus for $1.59, and sales of approximately $6.51B trounced the 5.87B average target.For Q3, adjusted EPS totaled $1.90, comfortably topping estimates for $1.74, and revenue of $6.43B surpassed the $6.15B average estimate.Sales in semiconductor systems, the company's largest business, fell 1.2% to $4.68B.Bernstein raised Applied Materials' price target to $175 from $150 after these results.Shares were rising 3% to $141.76 in premarket trading Friday.Yasin Ebrahim, Scott Kanowsky, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Analysts wary after Cisco's beat; retailers a mixed bagEuropean shares set for third straight weekly loss as rate jitters, China woes loom largeEuropean stocks weaken; U.K. retail sales slump]"
