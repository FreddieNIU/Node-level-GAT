One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.67bUS$5.29bUS$6.87bUS$10.9bUS$13.2bUS$15.2bUS$17.0bUS$18.4bUS$19.7bUS$20.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 21.12%Est @ 15.43%Est @ 11.44%Est @ 8.66%Est @ 6.70%Est @ 5.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$4.3kUS$4.5kUS$5.3kUS$7.8kUS$8.6kUS$9.2kUS$9.4kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$8.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$76bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.2%) = US$316bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$316b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$136bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$212b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$168, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.339. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Texas InstrumentsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Texas Instruments, we've compiled three important elements you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  Texas Instruments is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...Future Earnings: How does TXN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.The global economy is poised for a slowdown due to persistently higher inflation than anticipated, with potential pockets of resilience, according to Moody's Investors Service. Marie Diron, Managing Director for Global Sovereign and Sub-Sovereign Risk at Moody's, indicated that the slowdown is influenced by three key factors. These include sustained elevated interest rates, China's decelerating growth, and pressures on the financial system. Diron mentioned that central banks have successfully guided the global economy and fostered a disinflationary trend by raising interest rates. However, the concern of sticky inflation remains, which could lead to extended periods of slow growth if not addressed. Another risk stems from stress within the financial system. While banks have managed to handle higher rates, there's potential for strains to emerge, possibly in the later part of this year or next. China also contributes to the vulnerability. Moody's anticipates prolonged sluggish growth in the world's second-largest economy, impacting the broader region and potentially influencing default rates. Despite the anticipated slowdown, Moody's identifies certain ""pockets of resilience."" Diron highlights the favorable conditions and robust growth potential in markets like India and Indonesia. Indonesia, with its abundant natural resources, including essential materials for electric vehicle production, has the chance to develop its downstream sectors and leverage its resources effectively.The Nasdaq Composite marked its fifth consecutive positive day on August 30 but endured its largest monthly loss in 2023. Closing Thursday's session at 14,034.97, the tech-heavy index rose by 0.11%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.48% to 34,721.91, and the S&amp;P 500 decreased by 0.16% to 4,507.66. Despite recent gains trimming monthly losses, the S&amp;P 500 faced a 1.77% drop, the Nasdaq lost 2.17%, and the Dow fell 2.36% in August. Examining U.S. inflation data, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index increased by 0.2% in July and 4.2% year over year, aligning with predictions. This is a significant inflation indicator for the Federal Reserve. Joseph Cusick of Calamos Investments highlighted that equity movements are influenced by bonds, specifically U.S. Treasury yields, with a decline potentially supporting stock gains. Salesforce saw a 3% increase after reporting strong fiscal results and optimistic third-quarter guidance. With non-farm payroll data set to be released on Friday morning, traders await insights into the economy's trajectory. Economists predict 170,000 job additions, hoping the report will indicate a meaningful economic slowdown, potentially leading the central bank to reconsider benchmark interest rate hikes.Story continuesOil is set for a weekly rise as Russia signals export cuts extension and US inventories decline. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is stable above $83 per barrel, up almost 5% this week. Russia's OPEC+ agreement for further export reductions will be detailed next week, while a similar move is anticipated from Saudi Arabia. The collaboration between OPEC and allies to reduce shipments has led to lower US crude stockpiles. Recent government data showed a draw of over 10 million barrels this week, the lowest since December. Oil's climb this week helped the US benchmark secure a third straight monthly gain, supported by expectations of fewer rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and Beijing's measures to boost its economy in Asia. Underlying indicators suggest tighter market conditions, with WTI's three-month spread in a bullish pattern, the largest since November.On the stocks market front, notable stocks such as Palantir Technologies Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence market, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Artificial intelligence has been all the hype so far in 2023. Every notable tech company is trying to roll out advanced artificial intelligence products and services, while every consumer and investor is obsessively following AI-related news to keep apprised of how this technology develops and evolves even further. With rising interest in this technology, companies investing in this space are trying to make the most out of the artificial intelligence craze, as recent moves by several big tech names have shown.Competition In The AI SpaceAn example of one such company is that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The tech giant has recently announced that it is now going to be offering the company's Duet AI, a technology that is introducing generative AI applications to the Google suite of products, generally in Google Workspace. It is charging large businesses about $30 per month for each user making use of its artificial intelligence enhancements, which are being added to Gmail and other Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) productivity apps. The technology is being offered with a free trial before the paid subscription begins, allowing users to get a feel of what they can accomplish on their Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) applications with this technology incorporated in them. According to the company's announcement, a consumer version of Duet AI is expected to be made available in Google Workspace early in 2024, leaving those who are following the news closely in anticipation of the transformations they can expect from this tech.Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Duet AI is set to rival its competitor Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 Copilot enhancements in both pricing and user experience. The rivalry between the two big tech companies really goes to show how neither wants to be left in the dust by the other, leading both to continue working on and investing in AI-related products and services to make them readily available to their respective consumers. While companies are busy competing with each other over besting the other in the AI race, investors are in a panic over how to invest in this space to make the most of the AI boom we have been seeing. Considering this, here are some comments from CNBC's Financial Advisor Council member, Barry Glassman, about artificial intelligence, made this August:Story continues""AI has the potential to transform every company and how we go about the world. I believe AI is going to be as transformative as the internet itself. There's going to be distruptions just like the internet, there are going to sectors, industries, companies that fail because AI is just too easy and cheap. But at the same time, the overall productivity of the US and global economy, I think is going to take leaps and leaps so that we get so much more done and so many more innovations that the economy as a whole will benefit.""Niche Players Or Outliers?On the subject of how to invest in AI, Glassman said the following:""The niche players early on may not, in fact, be the long-term plays. For example, the early internet investments like AOL and Cisco were phenomenal in the first few years - they weren't the major players over the next 10 or 20. The same was true during the pandemic stocks... Even the non-AI companies, even the non-technology companies, they're going to benefit so much from this technology that I'm not sure it makes sense to just invest in the niche players in today's market.""Investors can thus benefit from taking a broader view of the market to find outliers that have the potential to benefit from AI alongside companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) that are right in the middle of the AI boom. Considering the above, we have gone through Goldman Sachs' AI stock picks to give investors an idea of what sort of companies institutional investors are leaning toward in this space today. These include top AI stock picks for the long term alongside many cheap AI stocks.Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksCopyright: kentoh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' second-quarter 13F holdings to pick 10 AI stocks based on the investor's stakes in them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the semiconductor market, head directly to 5 Best Semiconductor ETFs. Ever since the world has moved towards digital transformation, the semiconductor market has created quite the buzz. Semiconductors are crucial components for technology, be it smartphones, computers, electric vehicles, or healthcare, the demand for semiconductors is immense. While the demand for semiconductors was always high, the pandemic induced a global shortage. According to S&amp;P Global, the industry generally operated a just-in-time inventory system, which meant that raw materials were acquired as per sale orders. However, as the world was locked down during the pandemic, the industry experienced a major supply chain disruption. Not only was transportation halted, but as the world moved towards an online model, the demand for electronic devices soared. Consequently, this caused major delays in production for components used in electronics. While industries operated at roughly 80% of their utilization before the pandemic, companies still struggled to cope with the post-pandemic demand, despite operating at 95% capacity. Don't Miss: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeAccording to the The Semiconductor Industry Association, chip sales have decreased by roughly 22% in 2023, as compared to the previous year. As of April 2023, the global semiconductor market reported sales worth $40 billion, which increased merely 0.3% than that of March 2023. This figure was over $50.9 billion in April 2022. While monthly sales have increased in China and Japan – Europe, Asia, and America have all experienced declines. As per World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), the industry is expected to bounce back in 2024. As of May 2023, WSTS expects the market to grow by nearly 12% in 2024. While semiconductor usage is expected to increase in all major categories, this increase will be driven by the Memory segment, which is expected to rise by 40% over the year. Story continuesAs reported by Fortune Business Insights, the semiconductor market size was estimated at almost $528 billion in 2021. This is expected to grow to nearly $1381 billion over the next 7 years. This can be generally attributed to the increased dependence on the internet-of-things. While the automotive industry continues to grow, innovation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing is only going to boost the demand for integrated chips. Also Read: 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI BoomRecently, KPMG interviewed over 150 executives in the semiconductor space. According to their reports, 81% of the executives expect revenues to increase, as supply chain issues start to ease up in 2023. As per Mark Gibson, the Global Sector Head of Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications at KPMG International, the industry’s expectations of an increase in revenue hint that companies are “almost at the point of having excess inventory”. Mr. Gibson considers this a step in the right direction, as supply chain constraints alleviate over the next few months. In line with this, Gartner reported that while the demand for computers and smartphones stabilize, the industrial, automotive, and military sectors are set to dominate the demand. This means that the semiconductor industry is expected to experience more business spending than consumer spending. This article discusses some of the best semiconductor ETFs that provide investors with access to market leaders like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusBased in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 20.13%. The insurance company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.37 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.96%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.65% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.46 is up 15.9% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.21%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 19%. This means it paid out 19% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.73 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 24.48%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UNM is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%.Premium increased 3.9% from the prior-year quarter to $2.5 billion. Our estimate was $2.6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $2.5 billion.Total benefits and expenses increased 0.5% year over year to $2.6 billion, largely attributable to higher commissions, interest and debt expense, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other expenses.

For the second quarter, we delivered another strong performance. We grew revenue by 4% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency, and we beat the expectations on our bottom line on a non-GAAP basis driven by our disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan, our long-term brand-building growth plan. In the quarter, we again drove double-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses with double-digit increases in both our stores and in our owned and operated e-commerce, which are the channels where we are able to impact the shopping experience the fastest. Our D2C business will increasingly create a halo for our brands, that benefit the entire marketplace and we are excited about the accelerated momentum we are building there.Looking ahead, we are increasing our full-year outlook for our non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the confidence we have in our ability to execute to PVH+ Plan in the back half of the year. By focusing on what we can control, for the full year 2023, we remain well-positioned to deliver solid top-line growth in addition to double-digit EPS growth. We have strong conviction in the long-term potential of our brands and business and one of the ways we show it is through our share buybacks. In just the second quarter alone, we completed $200 million in buybacks, which was our initial plan for the full year. We are now planning to increase our buybacks for a total of up to $400 million for the full year. Independent of the macro-climate, the PVH+ Plan combined with our strong ability to execute will enable us to drive profitable long-term brand accretive growth, and geared towards our vision to build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and made PVH one of the highest-performing brand groups in our sector.Each of the five key growth drivers of our PVH+ Plan plays an important role on its own. And when we make them play altogether, which we increasingly do, we create something really powerful. Let me bring this to life across both brands with a few examples of how we are activating our consumer-facing growth drivers to win with product, win with consumer engagement, and win in the digitally-led marketplace. First, within Tommy, the team is doing a lot of exciting work around our talent amplification, which is starting to create a flywheel effect across product and consumer engagement, all the way through commercial impact. For Q2, the team connected our most iconic Tommy products like the Polo shirt, the Oxford shirt, and the Chinos with the network of the most influential talent and some of the spring and summer's biggest cultural events, ranging from New York Fashion Week to Formula One Grand Prix around the world to really cut through in the marketplace.One example where the team executed this really well was with a focused activation with talent toward our iconic Oxford shirt, styled in their unique way at the Tommy New York Fashion Week Dinner and Formula One Grand Prix in Miami, and they then engage their own audiences through personal and authentic social content, which in turn drove significant engagement on our channels and ultimately drove traffic into our stores and e-commerce. And through the network effect of this initiative, the brand drove triple-digit increases in sales of the Oxford shirt, which were up nearly 170% in the week following our campaign. In parallel to this, our talent partnerships continue to gain momentum in the quarter as part of the launch of our Mercedes AMG Formula One and Awake collaboration, we rolled out dedicated activations across Europe and the US, including a launch event in Miami with super talent like Lewis Hamilton.In addition, retail activations were held across Europe with personal appearances by George Russell in Budapest and Lewis Hamilton in Milan. Approximately 70% of Mercedes AMG Formula One fans, named the Tommy Hilfiger Awake collaboration as the most exciting and memorable partner content of the weekend, with half of fans highlighting they are much more likely to consider purchasing Tommy Hilfiger as a result of seeing the collaboration. And to cap it off, with super relevant timing, we are leveraging the sports rising popularity to connect on new levels with our customers, boosted by Netflix' Drive to Survive and our recently announced Formula One film sponsorship featuring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris. So what you can see here from these Tommy examples is how we leverage the unique strength of our iconic Tommy brand.Combined with very engaged long-term ambassadors who love the brand then we supercharged everything by connecting it all to culturally relevant global events to really cut through in the marketplace. This is a systematic and repeatable approach, but we are only just in the beginning to tap into. So looking ahead, we will continue to build out this work, starting with Tommy's fall campaign, which is right now underway, featuring seasonally relevant key categories and iconic American families. Let me now share a few Calvin Klein examples. The Calvin Klein brand is continuing to generate historically high levels of impact and engagement with our consumers in all key global markets. Propelled by our strategy of launching cut-through campaigns and igniting the talent engine.And in May, the brand launched a highly successful collaboration with Jennie Kim, sold through globally within days. They also launched an exciting partnership with some of the world's most iconic female athletes ahead of the much viewed World Cup. Across the quarter, this strategy generated a significant PR and social reach. Specifically, in Q2, the Calvin Klein influencer engine was ignited by brand ambassadors, including Jennie Kim, Kendall Jenner, Jungkook, Kid Cudi and more. These digital first campaign initiatives drove a stunning 828 million social impressions and 770 million PR impressions, both up significantly versus last year. Calvin added 1.7 million new followers to Instagram and now has well over 1.5 million followers on TikTok.The brand recently launched its fall 2023 campaign, highlighting iconic underwear denim. And in the first time in many years, more refined sportswear products that we know our Calvin Klein consumers really love. When looking specifically at Calvin product progress, and we have a lot of progress coming there. As we focus on winning with the best product in the market, our teams have created the best global hero products for men's and women's that will be consistent across global assortments, which together with Core Essentials will account for 20% of the SKUs and a much bigger share of the total sales from the fall '24 season and onwards. We're also accelerating innovation within our core product categories. For example, in underwear, we're bringing new fabrication platforms and performance elements into established programs, such as the iconic modern cotton.Just like in the example from Tommy, Calvin is fueling a very strong product category focus, creating the best hero products in the market than engaging their long-term talent partnerships and combining both to cut through in the marketplace. In parallel to improving the consumer-facing growth drivers, we're also committed to develop a demand and data-driven supply chain for both brands and we are making a significant progress here. Our supply chain improvements continue to accelerate and will provide us with drastically improved inventory to sales ratio over the coming years with much higher on-time and accuracy in deliveries, shorter transportation lead times, more responsive production models and more data-driven planning tools across our supply chain, we are now targeting a 25% decrease of our inventory levels as percent of sales.This decrease will be accomplished progressively as we move through the balance of this year and throughout 2024. And the exciting part with this is that we will be able to do this while at the same time, improving product availability for our consumers across channels and geographies. Importantly, this will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand, one of the highest value drivers in our business. There are several additional positive outcomes of this, including improving our cash flow and capital employed ratio from a financial perspective and even more importantly, reduce the pressure on operational cost of our logistics infrastructure. Lastly, as we are investing to fuel growth, we remain focused on driving cost efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest in the key growth drivers I just took you all through.During the quarter, we took the concrete actions we have previously shared in rightsizing our organization to simplify how we work, allow us to get even closer to the consumer and increased speed in our decision-making. Now turning to our regional performance and how we are connecting our brands and executing the PVH+ Plan across each region. Let me start with Europe. We continue to intensify our execution of the PVH+ Plan to further strengthen our market position in the region. For the second quarter, we delivered high single-digit year-over-year growth on a reported basis and low single-digit growth in euros. Our European business is now nearly 30% larger than pre-pandemic levels in euros. For the quarter, we drove strong performance in our direct-to-consumer business, where we continue to focus our efforts around elevating the consumer experience.For Tommy, through our hero product focus, we drove success in our key categories, like the shirt category, which was tied to impactful summer marketing programs around key essentials. We also continued to reinforce our key product categories by leaning into our top performers, such as the 1985 program. And at the same time, continuously evolving our essential product programs across men's, women's and kids. And for Calvin in Europe, we are further sharpening our hero product focus, and exciting with newness across categories. We are deepening our hero product offer and lifestyle expansion with cut through marketing, while at the same time, creating brand heat for exclusive product activations in power cities like London, Paris, Milan. A notable highlight for the region in Q2 was the grand opening of the Tommy Hilfiger store in Rome, Italy.It's our first ever owned and operated store in the city, situated on Via del Corso, Rome's Prime and best shopping street at the heart of the Italian capital. Looking ahead, our forward wholesale order book for the spring 2024 season, on a constant currency basis, is expected to increase low single-digits on top of very strong high single-digit growth this past year as accounts remain conservative. And as we have mentioned before, we are well positioned to capitalize on stronger demand in season through our never-out-of-stock products. Moving onto Asia Pacific. The region continues to deliver very strong performance by engaging consumers with product campaign launches and driving brand heat with locally relevant talent, underpinned by our hero product strategy, which generated double-digit increases at higher gross margins.Our strong execution drove revenue growth of 16% in the second quarter on a constant currency basis, including over 20% growth in China in local currency and continued strong double-digit growth in Japan and Korea. We drove very strong e-commerce performance of nearly 25% growth in constant currency as we successfully captured key consumer moments including 6/18. During the holiday, both brands moved up the rankings on digital platforms and achieved live streaming records of over $10 million. Newer digital platforms, such as Douyin continue to drive engagement. Looking ahead, we will continue to supercharge e-commerce and are gearing up for major consumer moments such as Double 11 and the Year of the Dragon with exclusive product capsules. We are driving consumer excitement with product-led campaigns featuring regionally relevant and global impact for talent such as Jennie and Jungkook for Calvin to expand brand awareness in the region.In China alone, we are leveraging more than 100 talent catalysts to amplify Calvin Klein hero product storytelling. And for Tommy for fall, we are looking forward to introducing new brand ambassadors as part of the global campaign. We're also seeing proof points in Japan as international tourists are starting to rebound. We recently refit our Tommy Omotesando flagship store in best location in Tokyo, which has generated strong improvements in sales with our central business growing plus 70% versus last year. By leaning into the core growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan in Asia, we continue to have major untapped growth potential for both our brands by tapping into the underpenetrated brand awareness in China and across the region. Turning to our business in North America.We continue to strengthen our North America PVH+ Plan execution across both brands, led by our direct-to-consumer businesses, which increased mid-single digits across Tommy and Calvin, driven by much stronger execution across all key elements of the PVH+ Plan. We have also enhanced experience and performance of our owned and operated e-commerce businesses and we drove double-digit growth there. All this drove significantly improved profitability across the North America businesses in the quarter. And we are gaining very good traction in building a sustainable foundation for profitable brand accretive growth for the region. We're driving increased product strength with pricing power and improving the overall consumer experience and marketplace execution.Beyond D2C, we continue to drive progress with key wholesale partners, working very closely with them to improve our brand's presentation in top doors and drive consumer demand by sharpening our category offense and leaning into our hero products and securing the inventory we need to fuel that demand. Let me share some important proof points, which highlights how our efforts to build our brands and businesses in North America driving positive results. First, we are advancing our category offense with a re-established base of key essentials and hero products that resonate strongly with our domestic consumer and driving growth across Tommy and Calvin stores as well as e-commerce sites. At wholesale, while our partners are more conservatively managing their business in a choppy macro, we are building a much stronger business with key partners such as Macy's.In fact, for Tommy indoors where we have strategically increased investments behind the brand to improve the consumer experience and inventory availability on the floor, we generated high single-digit growth versus the prior year. Also for Tommy, we drove over 20% year-over-year increases in key categories such as tees, woven shirts, underscoring the success of our global best seller initiative that we have scaled over the last year in D2C and now scaling in wholesale. Polos were once again the number one category, up over 30% year-over-year with higher AURs as we are elevating these key essentials. For Calvin, core premium essentials in D2C where the standout up nearly 30%. And as we have done with Tommy, we have expanded this initiative to wholesale where the performance has also been strong.Similarly, we also drove double-digit growth in refined product in D2C as well as continue to strengthen our offering in performance, very well received by the consumer, and we will further expand both these areas as we move forward. Operationally across the regions, we have made significant progress with our delivery times, now shorter than pre-pandemic levels. Lastly, with respect to bringing our North America women's business back from G3, we have made very strong progress, and we're in a great place with a multiyear integration work, both related to product development and the sourcing aspects needed and we are working very closely with our wholesale partners on co-creating the take back plan. Looking ahead in North America, we continue to focus our efforts around the domestic consumer to drive the business forward and see significant opportunity to unlock our full potential in the region.And before I close the Americas section, I would like to take a moment to address the recent wildfires in Maui, where we operated a Calvin Klein store that was completely destroyed in the fire. All our team members are safe, luckily, our hearts go out to our Lahaina team and the entire Maui community. We are doing everything we can to make sure our associates, their families and the broader community have the support they need during this incredibly difficult time. In closing, we executed another strong quarter. I feel very good about how well our teams continue to deliver on our long-term PVH+ growth plan with a relentless focus on driving brand desirability for both Calvin and Tommy, where we connect a very strong product offers, highly engaging marketing with a winning marketplace execution.We are encouraged by our results, particularly our continued strong growth in D2C. And we are looking forward to tapping into the more than 90% of potential that still lies ahead of us. With half of the year behind us, the other half still to go, we will continue our disciplined execution and successfully navigate this choppy macro environment as we have done so far. All while keeping our eyes locked on the long-term opportunity ahead of us to build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world, and make us one of the highest performing brand groups in our sector. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Zac.Zac Coughlin: Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our strong results for the second quarter, driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. We continue to build on our track record of strong performance, delivering on our top line guidance, while exceeding bottom line guidance as we compete to win in this highly dynamic global environment. We delivered reported revenue growth of 4% for the quarter, with constant currency revenue growth of 2%, in line with our guidance, and we exceeded our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $1.98, driven by lower expenses and a lower tax rate.Additionally, we returned $200 million to shareholders during the second quarter through the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of common stock, which was earlier than planned and enabled by our strong balance sheet. Importantly, our inventory levels at quarter end are well positioned, up 6% compared to last year and fully aligned with our projected sales growth. And as Stefan mentioned, with the significant progress we are making to deliver a demand and data-driven supply chain, we now expect our inventory levels to be significantly lower than 2022 in the second half of 2023, and that improvement will continue through 2024 with our announced 25% reduction in inventory as a percentage of sales. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect our strong first half performance to continue into the second half.And as a result, our full year business outlook remains largely unchanged. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance and operating margin outlook and raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook to a record $10.35. In addition to the continued strong delivery of our plan, the improvement in EPS is driven by two main factors, an increase in share buybacks and a decreased tax rate. On the share buybacks, we are increasing our planned buybacks from $200 million previously, up to $400 million. This supports our conviction in the execution of the PVH+ Plan and its long-term value creation as well as our priority to deliver shareholder value. For the tax rate, our outlook for our full year rate is decreasing from approximately 24% to approximately 22%.This is another step towards our multiyear commitment to deliver a sustainable rate in the low 20s. While our revised outlook reflects our growing confidence in our second half plan, we are also continuing to plan for 2023 with a healthy balance of optimism and prudence. I will now discuss our second quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, which reflected a 2% positive impact from exchange. Second quarter revenue for our international business was up a strong 6% on a constant currency basis, with growth in both Asia Pacific and Europe. Revenues for Asia Pacific were up 12% on a reported basis, including a 4% negative impact from exchange, led by China, where revenues in local currency were up over 20% compared to last year.Revenue in our European business was up low single-digits in euros, in line with our expectations, driven by strong growth in the direct-to-consumer business. In North America, our focus remains on driving strength in the direct-to-consumer business. We delivered another quarter of growth in both our retail stores and owned and operated digital commerce business with total DTC up mid-single digits and importantly, another quarter of improvement in sales to domestic consumers compared to the prior year. We were especially pleased with the double-digit growth we drove in our digital commerce business in both brands, as the investments we have made in the platform and overall site experience have begun to resonate with consumers. Wholesale sales in North America were down as planned, primarily in our Calvin Klein business, as retailers continue to take a cautious approach and we focus on driving sell-through and healthy inventory across the channel.From a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our direct-to-consumer businesses, where we have the closest connection to our consumer and can deliver the PVH+ Plan with greatest impact. We delivered another quarter of strong growth in both our stores and our owned and operated digital commerce business, with constant currency revenues up 10% and 11%, respectively, compared to last year. Our total DTC revenue was up 10% on a constant currency basis in the quarter and up approximately 350 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue compared to last year. Wholesale revenue was down 6% on a constant currency basis as retailers continue to take a cautious approach, specifically in the US. On a reported basis, DTC revenue was up 11% and wholesale revenue was down 3%.Our global brands also continued to deliver solid growth, with Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 6% and Calvin Klein revenues up 3% as reported driven by our hyper focus on investing to drive consumer engagement. As Stefan described in depth earlier, across both brands, we work with culturally relevant global talent and influencers like Jennie Kim and Lewis Hamilton, to authentically connect consumers to our iconic hero products and through some of the biggest events like New York Fashion Week, F1 Grand Prix and the World Cup and drove significant engagement and demand for the brands. On a constant currency basis, revenue for both brands was up low single-digits. In the second quarter, we delivered gross margin of 57.6%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to last year despite a 120 basis point negative impact to product costs due to exchange.Gross margin reflects a significant favorable shift in mix with our higher gross margin DTC and international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue and a favorable impact from freight compared to the prior year, consistent with the first quarter as we used virtually no airfreight this quarter. While we did experience a benefit from planned price increases, this was more than offset by higher product costs, including the negative impact of exchange previously mentioned, and the full impact of abnormally high raw material costs in effect when orders were placed in the latter half of 2022 as that inventory sold through during this quarter. Raw material costs have improved in 2023 and will benefit our gross margins as we move through the second half of the year and especially in 2024.SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the second quarter was better than planned at 49.4%, largely due to timing of expenses between the second and third quarter. We continue to make targeted investments to fuel growth throughout the quarter to drive the PVH+ Plan, including an increase in marketing compared to the prior year. G&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 210 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of the shift in mix to our DTC and international businesses along with a planned increase in the investments mentioned earlier. In total, EBIT for the quarter was $182 million, exceeding our expectations. Operating margin was 8.3%, which included the 120 basis point negative impact of exchange on our gross margin.Earnings per share was $1.98 compared to $2.08 in last year's second quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.28 with approximately half of that beat driven by the improvement in EBITDA discussed earlier and the other half driven by a lower tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results. Our strong second quarter performance is a testament to the power of our two iconic global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, our systematic progress toward developing a demand and data-driven operating model and driving cost efficiencies to enable us to invest in brand-building growth. And now moving on to our outlook. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue and operating margin guidance and raising our EPS guidance by $0.35 from approximately $10 to approximately $10.35.We continue to project revenue to increase by 3% to 4%, as reported, and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis and operating margin for the year to be approximately 10%. Regionally, our outlook for Europe is unchanged, planned up low single-digits in euros. Asia Pacific is now planned up low teens compared to previously up low double-digits with broad-based growth in the region, led by China, where easing of COVID restrictions has led to a strong rebound in demand for both brands. In North America, we are now planning full year revenue down low single-digits, compared to previously up low single-digits, which reflects a more tempered outlook on the improvement in the international tourist traffic in our US stores for the balance of the year based on continued trends.Our second half outlook for our North America business is otherwise unchanged as we continue to expect strong growth in our owned and operated digital commerce business and the current wholesale trends to continue for the remainder of 2023. We continue to expect our full year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022 despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange. The improvement in our gross margin reflects an approximately 100 basis point benefit from a favorable shift in channel and regional mix as we continue to drive growth in our higher-margin DTC business in line with our PVH+ Plan strategies and our DTC and international businesses make up a larger portion of total revenue. And as we've indicated previously, we can say with confidence that we will deliver approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to lower freight costs, a combination of both significantly lower air freight spend and a decrease of over 50% in ocean freight rates, both of which are an outcome of the significant improvements we've driven in stabilizing our supply chain.We expect gross margin improvement to grow an impact in each of the third and fourth quarters. We continue to expect that SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year will increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022 with our investments in DTC and mix of international business driving higher expenses. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to invest in key areas that drive growth, including increased levels of marketing with our full year target at approximately 6% of revenue for the year compared to approximately 5.5% last year. We've also made significant progress in our plans to implement the people cost actions we have shared previously. With the actions taken in July and additional actions planned in the third quarter, we have completed our target 10% people cost reduction in our global offices by the end of the third quarter, earlier than initially planned with an initial cost savings ahead of our targeted $100 million of savings net of strategic people investments.Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 10% and reflects high single-digit percentage EBIT growth. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $100 million, and our tax rate for the year is projected to be approximately 22% versus approximately 24% previously. We are confident in the strength of the PVH+ Plan and our ability to execute in the back half of the year. And as such, for the full year 2023 and we are now increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share projection to approximately $10.35, up 15% compared to 2022 and a record high for PVH. Turning to the third quarter. Our overall revenue is in line with original plans and is projected to increase mid-single digits as reported and low single-digits on a constant currency basis compared to last year.Third quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $2.70 compared to $2.60 in the prior year. As I mentioned, gross margin improvement in the third quarter is expected to grow an impact as the benefits we realized in the second quarter continue, including an even greater benefit from freight as we realize the full impact of lower ocean rates and the impact of abnormally high raw material costs begin to ease. We are also planning higher SG&amp;A investments in the third quarter with a particular focus again on marketing where our spend is planned to increase approximately 20% versus last year as we invest in cut-through brand campaigns that ignite our talent and influencer engine globally and elevate the brands across consumer touch points driving our continued momentum for the rest of the year.Our tax rate for the third quarter is estimated at approximately 22% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $25 million. Before we open it up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with another strong quarter. As Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser-focused on delivering our commitments by executing the five key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, bringing together the consumer-facing value drivers of product, consumer engagement and marketplace with the underlying operating engines and delivering consistent results in a systemic and repeatable way. And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions.See also 25 Most Civilized Countries in the World and 30 Countries With Most Arable Land In The World.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.Robert Drbul: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions for you. On North America, can you just elaborate a bit more just on the traction that you are gaining in North America, especially an update on the profitability? And then I guess the second question around North America is just some of the commentary you made around US wholesale. Can you just expand a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing in your assumptions into the back half of the year on the US wholesale business? Thanks.Stefan Larsson: Well, good morning, and thanks, Bob. What's really exciting for us to see and to share this quarter is that the critically important work that we started a year ago to build this sustainable, strong foundation for brand accretive growth in our home market, both Calvin and Tommy be loved in America. We haven't put enough focus on the domestic consumer. So as part of PVH+, we put laser focus on building this sustainable foundation. And as we have mentioned through the quarters, we have seen under the surface improvement, but this is a pivotal quarter because you can all see it. And starting with Calvin and Tommy, both driving mid-single-digit growth in D2C in a very choppy macro. And we're driving this growth, both in stores and in e-commerce.And it's directly driven by the PVH+ execution in product, marketing and the marketplace execution. So what do we see? We see that AURs are up. We see that the gross margin rate is up. We see that through the simplification of how we work and get things done, we see that the flow through in EBIT rate improvements and Zac will be able to take you through a little bit more details on that. But it's really a pivotal moment where you now see the proof points that we have been working on over the past year. And mentioning a little bit more about how we do this from a PVH+ perspective. Because across both Calvin and Tommy, we start with leveraging the strength of the brand love for the brands then we build out category offense and best hero products.And you can see in Tommy, this quarter, the global bestsellers drove 20% growth. And this is, again, in these market conditions, 20% growth. And in Calvin, the premium essential drove 20% growth as well. So we see that the category offense and the hero products are paying off, resonating really well with the consumer. And then we have gotten better and better on connecting the brand and the products with the talent partnerships that we are building out. So we are building out long-term talent partnerships where we have talent amplifying our products, amplifying our brands, and then we connect the product, the brand, the products, the talent with big events that are culturally relevant, whether it's New York Fashion Week or its Formula One in Miami.So we are starting to create a flywheel with bringing the brands to life closer to their full potential. And then -- so that's the consumer-facing brand desirability improvements. But then we combine that with the underlying business engines. So as I shared in my prepared remarks, what's really exciting is that -- this quarter, we're also able to take a big next step towards a demand-driven supply chain. So think about it, we're setting out to drive higher growth with 25% lower inventory. And then you might ask, how is that possible. Well, it comes back to three things. It comes back to the category focus, the hero product focus, the increased discipline in how we build the assortment and then how we plan that closer to demand, we're cutting our lead times and then how we improve the allocations.So you have the consumer-facing improvements and then you have this underlying business engine. And then on top of that, you have the efficiencies and the simplification of how we do the work. And that is what you start to see now in the P&amp;L. So Zac, if you want to complement that.Zac Coughlin: Yes, I mean, a significant step-up in profitability for both Tommy and Calvin order in North America, greater than 6% in Tommy, greater than 8% in Calvin. And I think what we love about that result is how widespread that improvement was. Improvement across both brands, improvement across all channels across both brands and higher gross margin percent and stronger SG&amp;A management. So really a widespread step forward. So mid to high single digits is really only the first step in our commitment towards low teens, but it's an important one and a sizable one this quarter.Stefan Larsson: Yes. Thanks, Zac. And Bob, when it comes to US wholesale, we know that the channel is choppy and challenged. But what's exciting under the surface here, again, is that when we lean in with our most important partners like Macy's, and we focus on bringing PVH+ to life for Calvin and Tommy together, we see some really encouraging results. So this past quarter, as we mentioned, we were able to drive significant growth in the pilot doors in the doors where the top doors where we execute the category offense, the hero products, we have the inventory. We have the vendor. We work with Macy's to have more staffing on the floor. So we treated more as the best expression of our stores. And then we see immediately the performance driving. So it's another proof point that over the next few quarters, we will build out together with our best wholesale partners.Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Stefan, I'm interested in your comments on delivery times, improving the inventory reduction you're talking about, you just mentioned simplification. Can you maybe just talk about the developments in the supply chain side of the PVH+ Plan over the last 90 days and give us such an idea about how that part of the plan is trending and what you're seeing there and how you're getting some of these improvements that you're talking about?Stefan Larsson: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jay. So let's just start with -- we really strengthened our supply chain leadership when David joined us with his H&amp;M Group experience. And he was able to work with our strong team to just get them more focused on and get us more focused on getting the basics right to start with on-time delivery, shorter transportation lead times, more responsive production solutions and models, more data-driven planning tools. And in doing that work like and this is my experience having deep experience in the supply chain side is you have to get the foundational pieces right, then you have to work super closely upstream with the product creation teams. And once you have that done, which we got done sooner than expected then we started we started looking at what could be a next breakthrough step.And then we realized that, that breakthrough is much closer than what we expected. So that's what enabled us to set the target of 25% less inventory in relation to sales by the end of 2024. And we are already internally driving to our staff. And that comes back to what I mentioned earlier. It's just -- it starts with how we plan the assortment, how we build the assortment and having an intention behind every single product and then connecting that to better demand planning and then connecting that to better allocation. And we see so part of the D2C growth in North America right now is fueled by that better planning and that better allocation. But we're just in the beginning, but the 25% is significant. And if you look at the value creation potential is that it's real.And then you look at even the sustainability component of -- instead of running the business with too much inventory at any given time that most do in our sector, we're able to get much better match between what we create, plan and produce is actually much closer to what the consumer wants. So, yes, very exciting.Jay Sole: Got it. Thanks.Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.Unidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Robert on behalf of Ike. Just had a quick question on -- do you have any reads on your fall product by brand?Stefan Larsson: Yes. Thanks, Rob. So early days for fall but positive response. So both Zac and I mentioned that we are in great shape inventory-wise. And there are perspectives -- two dimensions of inventory. One is the level. So we're in great shape across the brands and across regions when it comes to the levels. We're also in great shape when it comes to the composition. So we all know that it's so important in our sector to have fresh inventory to when you start to fall season to have more fall season product, more fresh products this year than what we had last year, and that's exactly where we are. And then we look at the initial sell-through reads fall and positive across both brands all regions, early, but very positive.Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Nardone with Bank of America.Chris Nardone: Great. Good morning, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit more about some of the moving pieces in SG&amp;A. First, if you could talk about the cadence and when we should start recognizing the $100 million in net savings. I think you actually said it might be greater than that. And then secondly, in terms of marketing, is the 6% target this year a level where you feel comfortable over the medium term to drive towards your PVH+ targets or is there a need to continue to drift that percentage higher? Thank you.Stefan Larsson: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Zac. But from a cost efficiency perspective. What's most -- what's always been most important for us is to find the most simple, close to consumer way of working that gives us speed in decision-making. And that's what made us set out the initiative this year to right-size the organization to the PVH+ Plan. And Zac will take you through more in detail how we executed on this. And that's going to be a continuous work for us to get closer to the consumer and to get faster because at the end of the day, we have the brands, we have the vision, we have the plan to win and outcompete our competition on medium, long term is our ability to execute. And most big companies get slow, gets bureaucratic.And that's -- I'm out a lot working with our teams to say, how can we work like a small company? How can we get the speed of when we are out seeing in stores, what we need from the consumer how can we cut the time in half to take action? So that's the beginning on the efficiency part. The second part is then connected to the marketing piece, which is investing into growth. So part of the efficiencies we free up is to invest in the growth. And marketing the 20% increase in marketing, as Zac mentioned, it's -- we feel really good about that on the near term and medium term to your perspective because there is also a lot of effectiveness work we have to do in terms of how are we spending those investments. So are we spending them to cut through?Are we spending them in consumer-facing initiatives? Are we spending them in the talent? Are we spending them in the -- in the big events that we have to cut through? So it's both the investment levels that we are increasing, which I feel really good about. And then it's the effectiveness. And then we just continuously monitor to see that we are reinvesting enough to cut through.Zac Coughlin: Yes. Thanks, Chris. I think we're really proud of the work we started last year on redefining how we spend SG&amp;A. So we've seen already in the first half of the year, significant investments in DTC, which comes with margin expansion and the marketing spend we've talked about, which we know comes to the benefits there. So as we look forward into the second half, we absolutely expect to continue on those investments of driving DTC growth and marketing as key SG&amp;A investments. But to your point, on the other side of things, what starts to become an increasingly powerful impact is the work we've done on our previously committed 10% people cost reduction. So the program, we took some significant steps in the second quarter.We will finish the program in the third quarter. So a quarter early from what we had planned previously and the impact is slightly ahead of the $100 million we've committed. So I think we'll see some impact of that in the third quarter. But in reality, we start to see that pick up most impact really into fourth quarter, and then that will carry forward into how that annualizes for next year.Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Paul Kearney with Barclays.Paul Kearney: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and great to see the progress in North America. A question on guidance. I think it was mentioned that the change in guidance was mostly driven from lower tax and share repurchases. Given the supply chain improvements and finishing the SG&amp;A improvements a quarter early, just wondering whether you're seeing anything incremental offset this benefit in the back half or if it's just some conservatism on the demand side? Thanks.Stefan Larsson: Thanks, Paul. So this is Stefan. Let me just start by saying we're able to take our guidance up because we continue to deliver what we said we were going to do from an operational standpoint on how we drive desirability in the brands and how we execute those in the marketplace. And then that leaves us to be able to invest back in the business and invest in growth. And that leads to -- that's the foundational strength that leads to us taking up the guidance. And then Zac if you want to mention what it means in terms of our ability to -- because when that works really well, we are first investing back into growth. And then secondly, as we shared this quarter, we are able to invest back more into ourselves through the increased doubling of the share buyback.Zac Coughlin: Yes, the year continues to shape up nearly exactly as we had planned really across all dimensions from there. So the small sort of puts and takes on the business. But -- so that's leading us with significant confidence. And I think if we take a look at the second half, really gaining confidence in our ability to drive the continued profitability improvements that we've got committed. On the increase side of things, two important impacts. One is on the share buybacks. And I think it's really important to comment on the value of that inventory improvement we're seeing that frees up working capital to turn around and invest in either other elements of the PVH+ Plan to drive growth or as we saw with the announcement we made on the share buybacks, a significant increase from $200 million to $400 million full year, including $200 million of share buybacks in the second quarter alone.And so as you mentioned, some of that work around inventory and of the plans, what that does is it frees up capital there to return back to shareholders. And the other half of that is the tax improvement from 24% to 22%. That increasing as well representing the rest of the increase as we continue to work a tax rate down as we committed to over the prior year. So I think overall, we feel great about where the operating business is coming in and what that sort of certainty is allowing us is to free up the capacity to return cash back to shareholders via the share buyback and that's what's leading to the increase.Stefan Larsson: Operator, we have time for one more question.Operator: Thank you, sir. That question will come from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Roach: Good morning and thank you very much for taking our question. Stefan, I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit more on the outlook that you see for AUR and pricing opportunity as you balance the brand and product investments you're making as you develop a PVH+ Plan? And then secondly, Zac, can you remind us the opportunities that you see ahead to recapture some of the outsized promotions that you saw last holiday as you move into this holiday season? Thank you.Stefan Larsson: Thanks, Brooke. So on the AUR side, it's exciting to see because I spend a lot of my time in product category, work and product category reviews and looking at product development and the pricing opportunity. So we have a significant AUR opportunity over time leaning into the category offense. And every time we lean into a category, every time we develop the best hero products in the market better than our competition, we see an opportunity to sell through at a higher AUR. So very encouraged early days still. And that is something that over time, we just continue to create better product value for the consumer.Zac Coughlin: Yes and I think on the promotion side, Brooke, we, of course, will continue to participate actively competing to win in the marketplace of where this is. But one of the reasons why we're so excited about where the inventory levels are today and will continue to improve throughout the back half of the year is that, that's going to allow us to make sure that we're able to, ourselves practically make those choices. And I think we can think about annualizing what last year holiday season was. There was a lot of things in the industry on the other side of this. We will have the chance to choose where to participate or not. And so we would expect to see gross margin improvement versus last year because of that strength of getting our inventories into the spot. We feel great about them heading into the back half of the year.Stefan Larsson: Thanks, Zac, and just to --Brooke Roach: Thank you very much.Stefan Larsson: Thank you, Brooke, and just to wrap up. So what we have is Tommy and Calvin, two unique absolutely unique and globally iconic brands. And what the PVH+ Plan is all about is us leaning into the DNA of each of these brands and drive brand desirability in product, marketing, marketplace and then at the same time, build out that underlying growth engine business engine that enabled us to build the brand and drive growth in an increasingly systematic repeatable way. So the real strength and the real value will come from the compounded effect of us doing this quarter after quarter, month after month, week after week like consistent in direction, consistent in focus and just relentless in step by step by step. So thank you for being on this journey with us and have a great week everyone.Operator: This concludes the PVH Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.]"

Loots, who serves as board member of Playworks Minnesota, joined the afternoon awareness campaign.""This was a great way to remind people of the power of play. It was fantastic to watch very meaningful leaders and professionals immediately enjoy play,"" said Loots. ""When you play games together, it sets the tone for how we work off the playground.""The idea that play can have a positive impact both on and off the playground is at the core of Playworks' mission to bring out the best in every child, through play. By partnering with teachers, principals and parents, Playworks provides opportunities for children to contribute on the playground, in the classroom and in the community - creating a sense of belonging.With Playworks on campus, trained recess ​coaches​ teach students to use ""butterfly fingers"" to tag lightly in tag games to reduce playground scrapes and bruises. And fun variations of traditional playground games can be introduced to make recess more inclusive-like Crossover Dodgeball, where the goal is to get everyone to the other side and no one is ""out.""Loots got involved with Playworks in 2020, noting that the organization's mission and the science behind the approach and programming resonated with him. Not only is he a father of two children, ages seven and 10 years old, but he spent time during his college years running playground activities at a low-income school.Joining the Playworks Minnesota Board as the COVID-19 pandemic was unfolding, Loots took an active role in helping the organization pivot to the virtual world, to ensure students still received opportunities to play. He's also helped re-envision how the board functions, creating executive committees and an executive leadership board - a concept that is now being adapted by Playworks regions across the country.​​Werner also brought his playground skills to the recent Playworks Minnesota Annual Kickball Tournament as a member of one of two U.S. Bank teams who were there ""kickin' it for kids​."" Proceeds from the tournament will help subsidize the cost of Playworks programming in low-income schools in the Minnesota metro area.Across the company, a number of U.S. Bank employees also give their time to Playworks​ regions​​​, including Dorian Brugger, branch banking market leader for Colorado and New Mexico. Brugger has prioritized volunteerism throughout her 15-year career at U.S. Bank, joining the Playworks Colorado young professional board in 2018 and now serving on the fundraising board.Through her involvement with the board, Brugger has helped shape creative, low-cost fundraising ideas to engage young professionals and increase awareness of Playworks' impact in the community. Just one example is a rock paper scissors tournament hosted at a local brewery.Brugger says data from Playworks shows that when Playworks programming is in place at a school, there are 77% fewer incidents of bullying reported.""We hear much more now than we used to regarding the issue of bullying. It's something many of us can relate to - whether we were bullied or have a child, friend or family member who was,"" Brugger said. ""That's where this program really comes to life.""For more information on Playworks, visit https://www.playworks.org/.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/779015/making-an-impact-one-recess-at-a-time]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW), we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Edwards Lifesciences is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$9.0b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Edwards Lifesciences has an ROCE of 21%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.2%. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences roceIn the above chart we have measured Edwards Lifesciences' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Edwards Lifesciences Tell Us?In terms of Edwards Lifesciences' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 21% and the business has deployed 74% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Our Take On Edwards Lifesciences' ROCEIn short, we'd argue Edwards Lifesciences has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 63% return if they held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesWhile Edwards Lifesciences looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

If you are not interested in reading the details, feel free to skip and head straight to the 5 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 2023. In an increasingly digital and connected world, uninterrupted power supplies (UPS) have become an essential safeguard against unexpected power outages and fluctuations. As we enter 2023, the demand for reliable power backup solutions remains unchanged. Whether you're a home user looking to protect your valuable electronics or a business seeking to ensure uninterrupted operations, the choices for UPS systems have evolved to provide more advanced features, higher capacities, and greater efficiency than ever before. In this guide, we'll explore the best-uninterrupted power supplies of 2023, designed to deliver peace of mind and uninterrupted power in an era where staying connected is non-negotiable. From compact models perfect for home use to robust units capable of supporting critical infrastructure, this list encompasses the top-performing UPS solutions to keep your devices and operations running smoothly, even when the lights go out. The Vital Role of Uninterrupted Power Supplies Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS) are a critical investment for any organization that relies on technology to maintain productivity and avoid costly downtime. According to industry statistics, power outages and other electrical disruptions cost businesses in the United States over $150 billion yearly, underscoring the importance of having a reliable UPS system to ensure uninterrupted power supply to critical systems and equipment. In addition, power fluctuations and surges can cause irreversible damage to electronic devices, resulting in significant repair and replacement costs. Therefore, investing in a high-quality UPS system is essential for maintaining productivity and protecting valuable equipment and data. Story continuesMaking the Right UPS Choice in 2023 When selecting the right UPS for your business in 2023, several important factors must be considered. First, you must evaluate your power requirements and determine the appropriate capacity required to support your critical systems and applications. According to recent studies, the average power requirement for a small business is around five kVA, while medium-sized companies require about 10-15 kVA.  Additionally, you should consider the type of UPS technology that best suits your needs, such as line-interactive or double-conversion. In 2022, the global UPS market was worth USD 9.45 Billion. Looking ahead to 2032, it's set to double, reaching an impressive USD 19.48 Billion, showcasing significant growth. It's also essential to evaluate the reliability and maintainability of the UPS and its scalability and flexibility for future growth.  Finally, it would help to consider the total cost of ownership, including initial purchase price, maintenance and service fees, and energy efficiency. Businesses spend between thousands to tens of thousands of dollars on UPS systems, depending on their size and requirements. However, investing in energy-efficient UPS systems can save businesses 30%-55% on their energy bills in the long run. Considering these factors, you can make an informed and practical decision when selecting the right UPS for your business in 2023. Future Trends in UPS Technology UPS technology's future looks promising, with some exciting new trends emerging. For example, lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly popular due to their high energy density and long lifespan. This trend is supported by recent financial data, which shows that the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow from $36.7 billion in 2019 to $129.3 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.0%. Another trend that is gaining traction is the integration of renewable energy sources into UPS systems. This approach is not only environmentally friendly but can also help to reduce operating costs in the long run. According to recent market research, the global renewable energy market is expected to grow from $928.0 billion in 2017 to $1,512.3 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 6.1%. Finally, the adoption of smart grid connectivity is set to revolutionize the UPS industry. By connecting UPS systems to the grid, they can automatically respond to changes in power demand and adjust their output accordingly. This trend is supported by the fact that the global smart grid market is expected to reach $130.2 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 17.4%. These trends are up-and-coming and will help make UPS systems more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly in the coming years. 10 Best Uninterrupted Power Supplies in 2023Our Methodology Our methodology for identifying the best-uninterrupted power supplies in 2023 involved conducting thorough research using sources like Life Wire, Tech Radar, The New York Times, PC Guide, and Silent PC Review.

GOBankingRates surveyed more than 1,000 Americans ages 18 and older from across the country between Aug. 14 and Aug. 16, 2023, and found that 41% of respondents opt for Walmart when stocking up on food essentials if they’re looking for a deal. Interestingly, this preference for Walmart held up across age and gender demographics.Costco’s Best Deals? Employee Reveals 10 Standout Buys for Your MoneyFind Out: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesHere’s a closer look at how Walmart keeps prices low and how you can save more.How Does Walmart Keep Its Prices So Low?With the mega retailer’s vast selection of food items and affordable prices, it’s not shocking to see Walmart as the go-to destination for budget-conscious grocery shoppers across the country. Walmart even proudly states on its website that “Every Day Low Price (EDLP) is the cornerstone of our strategy, and our price focus has never been stronger.” But how does the retailer keep its prices so wallet-friendly without sacrificing quality or going out of business?Lack of CompetitionAs of 2023, Walmart boasts over 5,000 brick-and-mortar stores in the United States alone, and it’s estimated that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. In other words, no matter where you go in the U.S., chances are high that you’ll be within striking distance of a Walmart location. With such a wide reach across the country, Walmart’s access to a reliable and large customer base allows the retailer to keep costs low without worrying about losing customers to competitors. Plus, with its massive sales volume, Walmart could still be profitable even if the margins are smaller.Bargaining PowerAs the world’s largest retailer, Walmart has bargaining power when it comes to its extensive network of suppliers, allowing it to purchase merchandise in bulk at lower prices than competitors. And by demanding lower wholesale rates from suppliers, Walmart can pass these savings onto its customers.Story continuesAdvanced TechnologyBy harnessing the power of data analytics, automated ordering systems, robotics and other advanced technology, Walmart has been able to streamline overall efficiency and reduce operating costs. For example, the company recently announced plans to build four new high-tech fulfillment centers in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin and implement automation technology to double the number of customer orders they can fulfill in a day.See: 10 Cheap Aldi Brand Products Better Than the Name BrandsWays To Save Even More on Groceries at WalmartAccording to 2021 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average U.S. household spends $5,259 annually on groceries — or about $438 monthly. Here are a few ways to lower that amount by shopping at Walmart.Shop the ‘Rollbacks’ Grocery CategoryIf you’re looking to save money on your grocery bill, check out Walmart’s ‘Rollbacks’ grocery category. Walmart’s Rollbacks section features items that have been deeply discounted for a limited time, and you can typically find them on the shelves at the end of an aisle. You can also browse the Rollbacks category on its website if you prefer to shop for groceries online.Use the Walmart Savings Catcher ToolThe Walmart Savings Catcher Tool, a feature found within the Walmart app, compares the prices of your purchased items with those of local competitors like Best Buy and Target. If it finds a lower price elsewhere, it’ll refund you the difference in the form of a Walmart eGift card.To save on your next grocery trip to Walmart, use the Savings Catcher Tool to scan the receipt for everything you buy. But remember, you only have seven days to upload your Walmart receipt to the app for it to work.Shop Walmart’s Special Sales EventsEvents like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and other holiday sales often offer deep discounts on a wide range of products, including groceries. If you can plan your Walmart grocery trips around these special sales events, you could score major savings on bulk items, discounted perishables and buy-one-get-one-free offers that can drastically reduce your grocery bill. To stay in the loop with Walmart’s big sales, download the Walmart app or register for the Walmart newsletter when you sign up for an account on its website.Use Walmart’s Credit CardWalmart’s credit card gives you 5% cash back on online purchases, including groceries for pickup, 2% back on purchases in Walmart stores and fuel stations, and 1% back on purchases everywhere else that Mastercard is accepted. These savings could add up over time if you frequently buy groceries online. However, if you’re not in a position to pay off the balance in full every month, it’s best to avoid signing up for the credit card since you could incur hefty interest charges on late payments that will cancel out any potential savings.What To Buy at Walmart for the Biggest Savings on Groceries?You generally can’t beat Walmart’s prices on staple food items like the following:Pantry basics like grains, rice, beans and pastaCanned goodsFrozen fruits and veggiesDairy items like milk, eggs and cheeseDon’t just take our word for it, though. The AARP conducted an experiment in Long Island, New York, sending shoppers to Walmart, Aldi and Stop &amp; Shop to purchase 30 staple grocery items, including the ones above. The result? Walmart came out on top, with shoppers spending an average of $88.37, which was $2.54 less than those who shopped at Aldi and $26.12 less than those who went to Stop &amp; Shop.In terms of what not to buy at Walmart, Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst at DealNews.com, advises to stay clear of the Great Value branded food items. While it may be tempting to opt for the cheaper store brand, Ramhold warns that the quality may be lackluster. “If you’re looking to save money at Walmart, it’s best to shop other store brand items and use the savings to splurge on better quality brands,” she said. You may also want to skip out on fancy artisan bread, wine and liquor, fresh produce and high-end meat cuts at Walmart since you can typically find better deals at a local farmer’s market or even Whole Foods.Methodology: GOBankingRates surveyed 1,091 Americans aged 18 and older from across the country between August 14 and August 16, 2023, asking twenty different questions: (1) Have you had trouble paying your utility (gas, electric, heat, internet, etc.) bills in the last 6-12 months?; (2) Which of the following bills/expenses has been the hardest to keep up with over the past year?; (3) Have you bought a car/truck in the last 6-12 months?; (4) Have you ever been on food stamps?; (5) Have you or would you use artificial intelligence (AI) to earn a passive income?; (6) Where do you shop for the best deals on groceries?; (7) What is your current annual income?; (8) How much were you able to contribute to your savings this year?; (9) How much have your savings/investments decreased over the past year?; (10) Next year’s (2024) Social Security Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) will be 3% instead of the 8.7% it saw in 2023.

28,fc98bfb4-cc7c-3fd2-87d5-0f9f46955232,WMT,2023-09-01,Is Walmart (WMT) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-buy-wall-street-133006141.html,1693488606,STORY,['WMT'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Walmart (WMT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.45, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.45 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 30 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is WMT a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.7% over the past month to $6.42.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards.""A Positive Earnings Trend EmergesNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook beginning to improve in recent months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing.This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared 'earnings cliff' narrative.Q2 was the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines. The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -1.5% on +0.7% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT in recent days, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2's weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Unlike Walmart, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Story continuesWalmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 98.4% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -1.5%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn't show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn't leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management's guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

30,02a5aa41-1fbb-375a-b37b-52dda91a6c9c,RJF,2023-09-01,How a $2.6B team moved its entire AUM to Raymond James in 45 days,Financial Planning,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-6b-team-moved-entire-220640197.html,1693433200,STORY,"['RJF', 'SMMF']","[Financial advisors at Summit Financial Group, from L to R: Dash Grammer, Jeneen Slack, Steven Wilcox, Jay Gilson, Michael Schomaker, Kim Damiani, Donald Ledoux, Vanessa Savage, Brendan Noonan, Gina Morais, Nathan Bennett, Connor Merrigan, Cody Smith, John O'Dea, Aaron Peabody Credit: Raymond JamesWhen advisors leave one firm for another, one of the biggest questions that hangs in the air is whether and how quickly they can port out their books of business — in other words, bring clients and their assets over.Transitions in the industry can get messy, especially if the old firm manages to hold on to clients. But for Nathan Bennett's team of 16 advisors and 23 branch professionals, it was a remarkably smooth process to transition their entire books from the former Securian to Raymond James — one that other advisors looking to leave might find instructive.""We're very thankful for high-trust relationships with our clients,"" Bennett said in an interview.Read more: Raymond James bags $2.6B team of 16 advisors from SecurianA RayJay transition in record time The San Ramon, California-based team, Summit Financial Group, had managed over $2.6 billion of client assets at Securian Financial Services, which recently completed the sale of its retail wealth management business to Cetera Financial Group. The news, announced in January, had triggered Summit's initial decision to consider other options, said Bennett, a partner at Summit; mergers and acquisitions frequently are known to prompt advisors to leave.""We spent a couple of months doing it. Fair amount of plane flights, lots of Zooms, lots of videos, and really narrowed down the list to a couple places that we thought really fit our firm,"" he said. While Cetera and ""several major players"" that offered handsome and relatively competitive transition deals were all considered at some point, Raymond James Financial Services won out.While Summit moved on May 31 to the independent channel of Raymond James, the move was not announced until Aug. 28 — after Cetera's deal had closed on Aug. 10. All $2.6 billion of the group's former AUM had left well before then, Raymond James recruiter Jodi Perry said in an interview. While this is not unheard-of in the industry, often advisor move announcements only refer to the AUM an advisor or team used to manage — which can, depending on the team in question, vary significantly from what they end up bringing over in the months to come. Former Merrill Wealth Management president Andy Sieg boasted in January that a big team that recently left the wirehouse had failed to port out even half of its client books, six months in.Story continuesWhile it helped in Summit's case that it was independent to begin with — which tends to make it easier to move clients — its speed as a unit was notable nonetheless, Perry said.""I have never seen a team mobilize and come together so quickly to move their assets, so completely,"" said Perry, who is the president of the firm's Independent Contractors Division.""You would think that a transition like this would take twice as long as a 'normal' transition, but they actually did it less than half the time that we see any other transition take place.""Advisors in Perry's experience typically take around 90 days, or three months, to transfer over whatever clients they can. ""And then you get some straggling pieces that will come in"" after that point, she said. The Summit team took only around 30 to 40 days, Perry said — and by day 45, ""virtually"" all clients had come over, Bennett said.Perry said that typically at Raymond James, ""usually you're really pushing advisors"" to get across the finish line when it comes to the tedious administrative aftermath of a move — even though retaining former clients is one of the most critical elements to an advisor's move, since those client relationships form the basis of their own business growth and income.Read more: Commonwealth, Stifel and Raymond James get top advisor satisfaction grades, dethroning Edward Jones""Most of the time the advisors — really, they love the relationship side. They love the investment side. I don't think I've met a single advisor yet that loves the paperwork side of our business,"" Perry said.In the case of Bennett's team, Perry said, the size of the group actually played to its advantage during the move. Every advisor and branch professional chipped in to speed the process along, Perry said. ""They made our job on this a lot easier because they were standing right beside us.""Bennett agreed that the group's prior model of independence had made the transition easier. ""In the independent space, clients don't really spend a lot of time thinking about the back office broker-dealer,"" he said, adding that Summit was the name those clients identified with. Sealing the deal with tech and culture Selling the new capabilities of the Raymond James platforms was also an easy move with clients, Bennett recalled.""They have a new client portal and some of those new gizmos that they get to check out,"" he said of clients. ""They're very happy with what they have seen.""The Summit team itself was most attracted to Raymond James for those broad technological capacities, Bennett said. The firm's leadership had also come across as appealing, approachable and supportive of advisors' interest in personal development and focus on serving clients well. He added that leaving Securian had not been a ""panic exit,"" though.Perry said given the huge size of the team, ""we were really all hands on deck"" in recruiting them. ""We visited with them multiple times before they actually decided that they were going to choose Raymond James as a partner. They came to visit us at the home office.""Read more: How to woo advisor talent in a tough labor market""Culture is certainly a part of it. People seem to love the Raymond James leadership and management team. They show incredibly well during the recruiting process,"" Jason Diamond, an industry recruiter who is the vice president and senior consultant at Diamond Consultants, said in an interview.Although Diamond did not represent the team in question, he added that it's common for advisors to choose Raymond James because ""there's something to be said about having everything under one roof. No question.""For Bennett, the all-in-one support at Raymond James, which frequently invests in tools to help advisors grow their business — such as enhanced social media marketing capacities that it rolled out this year — indeed stood out. The full integration of client-serving tools, CRM, and onboarding into one platform was ""a big deal,"" he said, ""and the fact that they custody themselves was a benefit to us as well."" Finally, the firm's offering of access to resources for serving high net worth clients was appealing, said Bennett, who at age 47 sees plenty of runway left for growing his practice and wants to chart a promising path for younger associates at Summit to later step into.Read more: Raymond James enjoys record quarter as other firms stumble""They have the private institutional staff, they've got alternatives. They've got things that you feel are vetted, with high-level people making the decision, but still (allowing) access to all of them.""At some firms, Bennett said, ""it's a little bit more on your own, and from a risk profile, that isn't something that a firm that wants to stay relevant and growing for a long time is comfortable with.""Perry added that the Raymond James investment banking division could also help. ""If they have clients that want to sell a business, we've got the ability to help support that transaction.""Cetera, reached with questions for this story, declined to comment.]"

You do get boss-like feedback, however — so pick those stocks wisely.I have been working double time to better understand where the consumer is at this juncture and the economic outlook. The headlines read inflation is slowing. Yet execs at discount stores are telling me people are trading down to cheap canned tuna fish from deli meat that's still reeling from inflation.Teens appear to be buying pricey Abercrombie &amp; Fitch clothes, while their parents opt for shareable meals as opposed to single-serve soup in a bid to save some cash.""The other thing that is definitely prevalent is consumers are really looking to stretch that dollar. And so they're more apt to buy what we call more stretchable meals. These are purchases that allow you to maximize the number of servings, so think of pasta and pasta sauce, rice, condensed soup, and even broth,"" Campbell Soup CEO Mark Clouse told me.While those ""stretchable"" meals have gone up in popularity, Clouse added, the more single-serving categories, like a can of ready-to-eat soup, have been under pressure.Wild observations!This week has brought more wild reads on a consumer that most investors think is doing relatively well. A few:HP Inc. execs said this week in not so many terms people are still not buying computers because they are priced too high and they need the money for other things. Maybe it's soup?Best Buy execs called out rising credit card delinquencies this week, just like Macy’s and Nordstrom did last week.Chewy on its earnings call noted it's seeing more ""discerning"" shoppers.Cheaper cans of soup. One less bone for your pooch. A back-to-school uniform from TJX-owned Marshalls instead of Macy's.Story continuesThis is where the US consumer is right now (inflation-fighting beasts), and where they are likely to be during the crucial holiday shopping season.Whether investors pick up on this and rerate stocks is to be determined.Just remember when you are reading today that the economy created a ""solid"" amount of jobs in August.

These actions have positioned the company for long-term revenue growth through organic expansion.Omnicom Group Inc. Price Omnicom Group Inc. PriceOmnicom Group Inc. price | Omnicom Group Inc. QuoteOmnicom has a strong history of delivering value to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In 2022, the company distributed $581.1 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $611.4 million. In  2021, Omnicom paid out $592.3 million in dividends and bought back shares totaling $527.3 million. In 2020, the company allocated $562.7 million for dividends and $222 million for share repurchases. These actions not only boost investor confidence but also have a favorable impact on earnings per share.Omnicom's presence in various segments of the advertising and marketing industry not only diversifies its revenue streams but also equips it with the flexibility and expertise needed to effectively navigate the ever-evolving and dynamic marketing landscape.Omnicom's current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of the second quarter of 2023 was pegged at 0.96, higher than the current ratio of 0.95 in the year-ago reported quarter. It indicates the company is is not likely to face any problem in meeting its short-term debt obligations.Story continuesFactors AgainstOmnicom, a global corporation, derived approximately 48% of its revenues from international operations in 2022. It maintains a strong presence in key international markets, including the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and Japan, conducting business transactions in over 50 different currencies besides the U.S. dollar. This extensive global footprint exposes the company to potential risks stemming from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Due to internal restructuring and a focus on cost savings, certain sectors like technology and telecommunications have temporarily curtailed their expenditures.

Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Under the terms of the proposed settlement, income-eligible customers would receive a total of $650,000 in bill assistance over five years. In addition, the settlement outlines a mechanism for tracking cost savings realized through consolidated operations, which would be returned to customers as part of future base rate reviews.The settlement, if approved by the PaPUC, helps enable the path forward for the companies' March 2023 application filed with the PaPUC that would consolidate the subsidiaries into a single legal entity called FirstEnergy Pennsylvania Electric Company (FE PA). The distribution companies will continue to do business publicly under the existing local brand names that are familiar to customers – Met-Ed, Penelec, Penn Power and West Penn Power.The companies have requested PaPUC approval of their application no later than December 2023 and are also awaiting commission approval in New York. In a related proceeding, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the companies' consolidation application on August 14, 2023.Following consolidation, customers would continue to receive service from the familiar electric company brands that currently deliver their electricity. For billing and other customer-facing purposes, the four electric companies would continue to use their existing names. Similarly, customer rates and terms and conditions of service would not change as a result of the consolidation. Consolidation also would not change Universal Service Programs, Pennsylvania Customer Assistance Programs for lower-income customers, Energy Efficiency programs and Default Service programs. Any changes to customer rates, terms and conditions and programs will be addressed in future base rate reviews and other proceedings. Story continuesBy consolidating to a larger, combined company, FE PA anticipates gaining greater access to capital at more favorable interest rates to invest in projects to improve customer service and further enhance the energy grid.""We appreciate the hard work of involved parties in negotiating an agreement that will provide long-lasting benefits to customers, regulators, stakeholders and employees alike while continuing to deliver safe and reliable electric service to our customers,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""We anticipate consolidated operations to produce cost savings, which would be returned to our customers as part of future rate reviews.""If approved, the consolidation would also result in the transfer of transmission assets owned and operated by West Penn Power to KATCo. As a distribution-only company, FE PA would focus its investments solely to serve its local customers. It would not be responsible for financing transmission projects driven by ever-changing grid requirements and that potentially benefit utility customers in distant regions.Parties to the settlement include, but are not limited to, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the Office of Small Business Advocate, Pennsylvania State University, the Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement, the Coalition for Affordable Utility Services and Energy Efficiency in Pennsylvania, Industrial Consumer Groups and Industrial Energy Consumers of Pennsylvania.       Met-Ed serves approximately 587,000 customers within 3,300 square miles of eastern and southeastern Pennsylvania.

50,f7d0f237-6022-3d0b-96bf-2521752c7fbd,FE,2023-09-01,5 Safe Stocks to Buy Amid Declining Consumer Confidence,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-safe-stocks-buy-amid-122700199.html,1693484820,STORY,"['ETR', 'FE', 'PEP', 'JJSF', 'ATO']","[Job openings are shrinking, and the confidence level of Americans has taken a hit. Also, the second-quarter GDP grew slower than it was earlier estimated. Understandably, fears about the economy’s health and an impending recession have once again escalated over the past month.Americans, who were a lot more confident in July, are suddenly worried. Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks that assure steady returns seems prudent.Q2 GDP Growth Revised, Job Openings NarrowOn Aug 30, The ADP (ADP) National Employment report showed that private payrolls increased by just 177,000 in August, a lot lower than the upwardly revised reported 371,000 in July. This also missed the consensus estimate of 195,000.This follows the JOLTS report released on Aug 29, which showed that job openings declined to 8.8 million in July, lower than the consensus estimate of 9.5 million. Also, only 3.5 million workers quit their jobs in July, the lowest level in nearly two-and-a-half years.Clearly, the labor market is cooling. Lower job openings mean lower chances of people getting jobs. At the same time, fewer workers quitting their jobs decreases the chance of higher wages, which means lower personal income.In fact, the ADP report mentioned that job stayers saw a pay rise of 5.9% year over year in August, the slowest growth since October 2021.This came as the U.S. second-quarter GDP growth was revised down to 2.1% at an annualized rate from the earlier reported 2.4%.Consumer Confidence Takes a HitA slowing economy and sky-high inflation have been denting investors’ confidence. The confidence level reflected in Americans in July took a hit in August and declined to 106.1 from July's revised reading of 114, the Conference Board said on Aug 29. Analysts had expected it to touch 116.Moreover, a drop in consumers' assessment of future business scenarios is a distinct indicator that people are experiencing a sense of helplessness concerning an imminent economic downturn.Story continuesIn August, consumers' evaluation of current economic conditions saw a significant decline, plummeting to 114.8 from the previous month's reading of 153. Moreover, their outlook on economic conditions for the upcoming six-month period also deteriorated, dropping to 80.2 this month compared to 88 in July.Although inflation has more than halved over the past 12 months, it still remains elevated and a lot higher than the Fed’s target range of 2%. This has made Fed officials maintain their hawkish stance, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating more interest rate hikes.This is likely to further dent consumer confidence given that borrowing costs are already high after the central bank raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples, and utilities.

CRM to facilitate higher adoption of AI by business enterprises. The partnership is likely to drive increased productivity and help accelerate business transformation with generative AI.Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce a wide array of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations. Salesforce forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. The company is continuously expanding its generative AI offerings for incremental revenues.In June 2023, it expanded its generative AI tools with the launch of the AI Cloud service. With this, Salesforce claims to offer a one-stop AI-powered platform for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. Along with the launch of AI Cloud, the company raised its venture capital fund for generative AI to $500 million from $250 million announced in March 2023. With this enhanced fund, Salesforce Ventures, the company’s global investment arm, will support the generative AI ecosystem and promote the development of responsible and trusted technology.In order to drive increased adoption of its generative AI tools, IBM has partnered with Salesforce. Leveraging indigenous IBM technologies such as IBM Garage methodology, the company aims to help business enterprises undergo rapid digital transformation by embracing generative AI. The IBM Garage approach enables firms to manage strategic initiatives, quantify business outcomes and advance organizational and cultural change through bold IT transformations, re-imagined customer and employee experiences and automated business processes.IBM is further likely to help the clients complement Salesforce's generative AI tools with IBM Watsonx, a cutting-edge enterprise-focused AI and data platform designed to harness the power of advanced AI capabilities for businesses. IBM Watsonx offers a unified platform that enables enterprises to train, fine-tune and deploy AI solutions according to their requirements. Tailoring the AI per the business-specific needs significantly multiplies output. Watsonx exhibits greater flexibility and facilitates the seamless adaptation of traditional machine learning models and generative AI into new scenarios.Moreover, IBM will work closely with a diverse AI partner ecosystem through an open and collaborative approach to plan, build, implement and operate generative AI solutions. This open ecosystem approach is likely to help clients define the right models and architecture to deliver their desired outcomes. This, in turn, is expected to strengthen its market position in the rapidly evolving landscape of technology optimization and management.  IBM expects its growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the top 10 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USA. On 21st July 2023, seven major tech giants, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pledged a ""voluntary commitment"" to collaborate with the Biden administration to mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Following a meeting with President Joe Biden, these companies agreed to focus on safety, security, and trust in AI development. This included subjecting AI systems to external testing for safety and capabilities, safeguarding against cyber and insider threats, and ensuring that AI does not promote bias or discrimination. How Real is the AI Hype?Whenever a new technology enters the market, investors deliberate its economic implications and its potential to augment corporate profits. The hype around Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has now gained significant momentum which can be realized by the fact that it has contributed to a surge of nearly 40% in the Nasdaq Composite, in the first half of 2023. While some analysts have coined this surge as an ""A.I. gold rush,"" there are contrasting perspectives. Some believe that investors might be preemptively optimistic about the valuation of A.I-related stocks. These cautious perspectives suggest that the anticipated A.I. boom might not unfold as projected, especially concerning stock market investors.However, the analysts at Goldman Sachs present a differing view, contending that the hype about A.I. is indeed real. Kash Rangan, a software analyst at the bank, conveyed his viewpoint through an interview featured in Goldman's latest publication, ""Top of Mind."" Rangan stated, ""A.I likely isn't undergoing a period of unwarranted exaggeration. When there's a unanimous consensus within the technology provider community that a genuine technological shift is taking place, it signifies an actual transformation. Furthermore, when customer interest starts to escalate, such enthusiasm shouldn't be dismissed as mere hype. The growing interest from customers solidifies the authenticity of the trend.""

In fact, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, Ben Snider, projects a 1.5% annual productivity growth over the next decade through A.I which can potentially lead to a 30% or higher boost in S&amp;P 500 profits. To read about how AI can replace human jobs, check out our article about Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.To exemplify, we can look at how NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has risen as a leader in AI by spearheading the development of specialized GPUs optimized for intricate AI computations. These GPUs, built with powerful parallel processing capabilities, are exceptionally well-suited for AI tasks. With a 95% market share in the GPU sector, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominance has become more than evident, as it empowers a number of AI applications with outstanding performance and efficiency. Mairs &amp; Power, an investment advisor, released “Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund” that commented in second quarter investor letter:“Regarding stock selection in the first half, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a massive outperformer, up 189.54%. Amazon and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year. Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) computation for both learning and inferencing, and its stock rallied significantly on a massive earnings report in the first quarter as cloud data center companies invested heavily in AI.”In fact, in Q2 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue leaped to $13.5 billion, a twofold YoY increase, driving its stock up 220% since the year's start, with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. The company's specialized AI chips underscore its advantage, and thus, dominate 80% of the global market.Moreover, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s H100 chip which is vital for AI commands double its initial price due to high demand. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering a transformative trend with its groundbreaking ""Algorithm of Thoughts"" (AoT) which signifies a substantial leap forward in AI training. By combining human cognition and algorithmic logic, AoT aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This innovative approach, guided by in-context learning, streamlines problem-solving pathways which would result in faster and less resource-intensive outcomes. With AoT, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) envisions a more organized and systematic exploration of solutions, potentially surpassing the performance of the algorithms themselves. This marks a pertinent shift from traditional supervised learning methods to an integrated search process. As Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) drives this paradigm shift, it underscores their commitment to shaping the future of AI through innovative techniques that can revolutionize problem-solving across industries.List of 55 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USAPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashMethodologyTo prepare the list of artificial intelligence companies in USA, we conducted an extensive research to find out the companies that have been highly active and innovative in the US with their AI applications.

Never be left in the dust again.Thursday postclose roundup: Dell's huge results, disappointment at Broadcom, Lululemon beatsDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) soared 8.5% in recent premarket trading after the company said adjusted EPS totaled $1.74, smashing the $1.14 estimate, on revenue of $22.93 billion that topped the $20.86B target, as a jump in in service and software maintenance agreements boosted growth.Recurring revenue rose 8% to $5.6B year-over-year in Q2, driven by ""increases in service and software maintenance agreement,"" the company said.Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported earnings per share of $10.54 on revenue of $8.88B for its fiscal Q3, comfortably beating the analyst expectation for EPS of $10.43 on revenue of $8.85B, and said it expects AI-related spending on infrastructure software and semiconductors to boost demand.The company expects to record Q4 revenue of $9.27B, up 4% from the prior year but slightly below the $9.28B consensus. Shares were losing 4.6% to $880 in early Friday trading. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) shares were up 1.5% to $387 in Friday's premarket after the company reported Q2 EPS of $2.68 that surpassed the $2.54 estimate, as well as better-than-expected sales of $2.2B.The athleisure apparel retailer also said on Thursday that full-year profit should range from $12.10 to $12.17 a share, while revenue is expected at $9.51B to $9.57B.Salesforce lifts its outlook Earlier in the week, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) shares climbed 3% Thursday after the software outfit lifted annual guidance and beat estimates for Q2, touting improved demand for the second half of the year.Adjusted EPS totaled $2.21, easily surpassing the $1.90 average Street target, on revenue of $8.6B vs. the $8.53B consensus.Story continuesThe company lifted its full-year guidance to earnings of $8.04 to $8.06 per share - far better than analyst estimates for $7.45 and up from the prior $7.41 to $7.43 range - given an anticipated firming of demand and improved margins through year-end. Revenue estimates were slightly lifted to $34.7B to $34.8BOperating margin and operating cash flow growth was raised to 13.3% and a range of 22% to 23%, respectively. That compared with a prior estimate for margins of 11.4% and operating cash flow growth of 16% to 17%.Third-quarter adjusted EPS was expected in a range of $2.05 to $2.06 on revenue of between $8.70B and $8.72B, topping Wall Street estimates of $1.82 and $8.67B, respectively.Wolfe Research is staying with a Peer Perform rating ""until we get conviction around double-digit top-line growth,"" but the firm is also raising its margin assumptions for the company ""given the 'mission accomplished early' feel around margins, and the commentary around 30% being a floor not a ceiling.""Goldman Sachs said these results will ease ""some investor concern around Salesforce’s ability to balance top-line and OM expansion,"" noting that this ""can lead the stock to re-rate higher,"" much as several other tech names have managed to do.Shares closed Thursday at $221.46.Victoria's Secret misses Victoria's Secret (NYSE:VSCO) missed on Q2 estimates, triggering a Thursday premarket slide, but the stock ultimately pulled through in the regular session.EPS of $0.24 came in worse than the consensus estimate of $0.27. Revenue was $1.43B, below the consensus estimate of $1.44B.For Q3, the company expects a loss of between $0.70 and $1 far worse than the consensus estimate for a $0.14 shortfall. And for the full year, the company expects net sales to decrease in the low-single-digit range compared with last year, compared to the consensus estimate of approximately a 2% drop.Wells Fargo slashed shares to Equal Weight from Overweight on these results, lowering its price target by $2 to $16 per share.""Uncertainty on their ability to execute a turnaround is mounting and valuation should continue to erode,"" wrote the analysts.BofA lowered the price target by $5 to $25, but remains Buy-rated, saying it is ""encouraged by multiple opportunities to drive sales in 2H.""Still, shares strongly recovered after a low open, gaining 6.9% to $19.18.HP loses ground on soft guidance HP's (NYSE:HPQ) shares slid 6.6% after the company reported fiscal Q3 sales late Tuesday that fell short of Wall Street estimates, as well as weaker-than-expected annual earnings guidance, amid a slackening backdrop for PC demand.Adjusted EPS of $0.86 was flush with Wall Street targets, but its top line of $13.2B missed the $13.38B consensus.In its personal systems unit, which includes personal computers and accounts for the majority of growth, revenue fell 11% to $8.9B in Q3 year over year.The company's Q4 guidance was $0.85 to $0.97, compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of $0.95, and full-year EPS was estimated at $3.23 to $3.35, lower than the $3.37 average analyst target.Several analysts lowered their price targets on the stock following the print. Bernstein said the report was disappointing, writing, ""We worry about the structural health of the printing business and its ability to grow over time,"" even though PC revenues are ""likely to improve going forward.""The firm added that the shares are ""more expensive than HPE, which is less structurally challenged.""Yasin Ebrahim, Davit Kirakosyan, Liz Moyer, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Related Articles6 big earnings hits: Dell's huge quarter; HP's miss; Lululemon comes in aheadTesla launches new Model 3 in China with longer rangeIn wake of Credit Suisse, Switzerland told to better prepare for bank failure]"

The three-day event kicks off Tuesday, September 5. So what can we expect to hear from the industry leaders?Joining us now, we want to bring in Kash Rangan, a software equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. It's great to see you here, Kasho. So let's talk about the big theme. I have a feeling, I know what one of them is going to be, but what do you expect here?Story continuesKASH RANGAN: Guess what-- what you were expecting I'm expecting as well, and that's two letters-- AI.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.KASH RANGAN: Listen, I think this conference is going to be absolutely amazing. We got a terrific lineup. It's going to be three days. We're going to have-- I forget-- what 700-- more than 700 representatives from tech, media, telecom companies present.I think the key thing everybody is looking for, at least what I'm looking for, what I'm telling clients what to look for is what kind of uptake we're going to see with generative AI when it goes to calendar '24. We've seen a slew of launches from the likes of Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Adobe, and the list goes on.Practically every technology company has an AI offering. And they hope to get more customer wallet share in return for all their productivity.So when is that going to start to really manifest in revenue is one question. Number two, what's happening with macro. I mean, last year at same point in time, we were headed into this inflation spiral stasis and decision making, and company growth rates start to really decelerate as you start to look at the leading indicators.Now, we're at a point where things are stabilizing, right? So the second big question is, what is your macro outlook? What is the pulse of the spending environment? What the budgets for calendar '24 look like? And third is, when are you going to start to hire? There's no growth in the software industry unless you really hire. It's a very headcount-intensive industry.So we've been going through layoffs and freezes in hiring. And when is that going to start to turn around? When do you see the demand signals green shoots that will prompt you to hire? Hiring comes back, growth is going to come back next year. So those are the three big things.BRAD SMITH: Kash, from your perspective, what company needs to have an MVP-like performance at Communacopia in order to save investors' attention or at least some fanfare or perhaps reinvigorated around their company as we go into the fourth quarter of this year?KASH RANGAN: Minimum viable product or most valuable player, which one?BRAD SMITH: Most valuable player.KASH RANGAN: OK. Because I'm in the tech industry, MVP is a slightly different. Yeah.I think if you look at the two leading tech companies that at least from investor's perspective have been leading the charge for generative AI, it's Nvidia and Microsoft. And both companies are going to be presenting.And I think we're going to have-- very fortunate to have CFO of Microsoft Amy Hood. She doesn't present at much conferences, very fortunate to have her. We're going to discuss pricing power of the copilot. Every company is launching a copilot. We're going to have more copilot than pilots, but that's OK. It's all meant to boost productivity.So I think they are the first ones off the gate in software land with what we would call in the tech industry minimum viable product, as you would call it, a most valuable player. So I think Microsoft is the number one on that list with a very interesting product right off the gate.And I would not rule out Adobe. The CEO of Adobe rarely presents at conferences. And he's going to be with us. He's going to talk about the generative AI products that can be infused into the core creative family, Firefly, a whole bunch of things, Salesforce. Number four on that list would be ServiceNow. I think we're going to hear a lot of most valuable player type-- most valuable product type insertions in the mix.SEANA SMITH: Kash, I think there's a lot of investors out there trying to figure out whether all this hype, whether all this excitement over AI, if it's a bit overdone, given where the technology is and how companies are using it. Do you think there is a case for that at all at this stage?KASH RANGAN: I think the timing of when all this term comes to fruition was probably a little aggressive in our minds, investors' minds. I'll take some of the blame as well. And so we're going to start to see this manifest. Let's take Microsoft. Copilot was announced-- it was priced at $30 per user per month, much higher than what the market thought. And it's not-- it's not yet made generally available. Now, the expectation is that it's going to start to manifest in revenue in June quarter of 2024. So that's a good nine months away.I think there was an expectation that given how magical this technology is, you put it out and people start using it. It starts to have immediate impact on revenue. That's what investors want. But unfortunately, that's not going to be the case. It's going to take another six to nine months. I think the timing is the key disappointment versus people's expectations.But I think as far as what the technology itself can do, oddly the more time we give it to start to come to fruition, the more effective it's likely going to be.BRAD SMITH: What is the acceptability in terms of time range, where investors need to see some type of flow through to margins as a result of generative AI announcements and then investments, to which we still don't know definitive figures for some of these companies and how much they're putting towards these initiatives?KASH RANGAN: Yeah. Yeah. I think there's two phases one is learning, and then the other is inference to use a technical term. Learning is very capital intensive. So you need the likes of Nvidia, GPUs, Microsoft, Hyperscaler, Google. Let's not count Google out right. They're all in the mix.So this learning process is going to be very capital intensive. It's very data intensive, compute intensive. Then after we're done with all the learning, then we put the learning to work. And that's the inference phase. So the inference phase is high-margin stuff, right? That's when all the pricing power that we all want software companies to exercise and go out and have an Adobe charge for the new creative Firefly, or Salesforce charge more for the new products, that ChatGPT-oriented family, and ServiceNow with the Pro Plus and Microsoft Copilot. All that happens in the inference phase.So that's when the incremental cost for that incremental uptake we're going to get is still going to be very de minimis. That's when the margins really start to come to fruition. But right now, we've got to accept the fact that this is very capital intensive. We've got to take that hit on margins in return for the inference and the pricing and the big margin lift we could see in calendar '24. Does that make sense?SEANA SMITH: That does make a heck of a lot of sense. And then this also brings me to the question I want to ask you just about the first mover advantage and how much of a benefit some of these names like Nvidia, like you were talking about before, Microsoft, even Google on that list. Yes, they have invested a lot into AI up until this point. And yes, they have a very wide lead. But how worried or I guess, how quickly do you see some of their rivals potentially catching up to them?KASH RANGAN: I think in this degenerative game, there's going to be a few large language models and many not so large language models that are going to be domain-specific, sort of like application software. You have the big ERP companies, like SAP, Oracle. Then you have the vertical specific companies that are very in charge of their domains, whether it's health care or financial services. They own that vertical. And they're really, really good at it. But they cannot solve all of world's problems.In a similar way, what you're going to see is that the big companies, whether it's Microsoft, Google, maybe Meta, and a couple of others, really have the wherewithal to be able to train these large language models that can comb the entire world and solve many problems, many questions, but not really super deep in the domains. So to be able to train these models, put the compute behind it, it's extremely costly. Not many people have the scale and the smarts to be able to do it, right?So I think we're going to have three or four companies max really be in the fray for large language models. And then after that, we're going to see an Adobe-specific medium language model, a Salesforce-specific model, a ServiceNow-specific model, and Intuit-specific model, so on and so forth. That is not going to be that contested, because that language model is going to speak that particular domain of personal taxes if you're into it, service automation, if you're ServiceNow creative artist productivity booster for Adobe. Those are relatively locked in. The chances for competition to come and unseat that learning that can happen with these models that work with Adobe, work with Salesforce, work with ServiceNow. That's going to be a little bit hard to surround.But that does not mean that there's not going to be new entrants in the space. You're going to find new architectures, new applications, new problems be attacked by the startups. And there's going to be more new-- net new revenues that will not necessarily affect the incumbents at least for the first couple of years.]"

Although deals tend to fall out of the headlines once they are completed, Salesforce's monster deals still matter — even if Wall Street hasn't been pleased with them all.""This has been a hot-button topic for investors for years now,"" Morningstar senior equity research analyst Dan Romanoff told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s not just the Slack deal; there’s been a lot of frustration among shareholders. I don’t think anyone cares about a small acquisition, but when you’re doing that $27 billion acquisition of Slack, that’s when the frustration boils over.""Salesforce's largest-ever acquisition was for the workplace messaging platform Slack, a $27.7 billion deal that was first made public in 2020. A year prior, Salesforce acquired data visualization software provider Tableau in 2019 for $15.7 billion. And in 2018, Salesforce acquired software integration platform MuleSoft for $6.5 billion.Looking ahead, there probably are not too many multibillion-dollar deals in Salesforce's near future. Benioff told Yahoo Finance earlier this year that Salesforce is backing off M&amp;A for now.""They've gone on a diet on M&amp;A,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance Live Thursday.During this earnings cycle, analysts have been noticing the benefits of an increasingly integrated Salesforce.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Raymond James' Brian Peterson wrote that there's ""nothing slow about 'MuleSoft'"" as ""multi-cloud continues to expand.""And Wedbush's Dan Ives added: ""We also believe Benioff &amp; Co. is making major strides around integrating Slack on the back-end into the broader CRM suite. ... The pipeline is finally starting to build on this key acquisition.""Slack tells us who Salesforce wants to beSlack was undoubtedly the most controversial purchase in Salesforce's pre-pandemic shopping spree.""The Slack deal is the most aspirational, and still the most confusing going forward,"" Needham senior research analyst Scott Berg told Yahoo Finance.Slack CEO Lidiane Jones — who took the helm in December, succeeding Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield — explained what makes Slack and Salesforce fit.""My belief is that Slack should be the primary front door for every one of these business users and that your Salesforce interactions ... all of them can happen in Slack,"" Jones told Yahoo Finance. ""The idea is that we can kind of leapfrog productivity.""The Slack app icon displayed on a computer screen, Wednesday, Dec 2, 2020, in Tokyo. (Kiichiro Sato/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)There are already cases where this vision is starting to come to fruition, Jones added.""Slack is very scalable, and we have incredibly large customers using Slack today,"" she said. ""ShipIt, for example, is the entire logistics arm of Target, and they're running everything on Slack. ... We're very well equipped to embrace larger enterprise customers.""The vision is for a more consumer-facing Salesforce, but not everyone is sold yet.Berg said that, while the front-door theory might work out over the long term, in the near term, it still has a ways to go.""Slack today is still sold through a separate Salesforce because Salesforce reps can’t necessarily sell Slack right now — it’s too different of a product,"" Berg said. ""Slack doesn’t bring customers to your website.""MuleSoft and TableauThough all of Salesforce's acquisitions are in very different places, it's clear that it has structurally set up ways for them all to be in communication as they wade through their next phases.""I think MuleSoft makes sense strategically, having MuleSoft as a tool you can have help deploy your software, making installation as easy as possible,"" Romanoff said.""Tableau starts to make less sense to me, but it does fit into the model of: 'Oh, let's buy something we can plug into our Salesforce,'"" Romanoff added. ""I think it's debatable how much sense Tableau makes, it's certainly not an obvious home run in the way that earlier acquisitions like ExactTarget [acquired in 2013 for $2.5 billion] were.""For his part, Tableau CEO Ryan Aytay ""absolutely"" believes Salesforce and Tableau are a fit. ""It's critical because many of our customers overlap,"" he said.Salesforce Tower entrance in San Francisco on Aug. 21, 2019. (Getty Images) (Sundry Photography via Getty Images)And for MuleSoft CEO Brent Hayward, the proof is in how the company has scaled so far.""I remember sitting at a conference with our entire company before the acquisition and seeing that we would have to grow 40% to 50% annually to hit that billion-dollar mark,"" Hayward told Yahoo Finance. ""We were calling it our moonshot — and now we're sitting at $2 billion.""Though there was talk of divesting deals like Slack in the furor of an activist standoff earlier this year, that's simply not happening.""To me, divestiture is out of left field, that doesn’t happen in software,"" Romanoff said. ""Salesforce still sees itself as a growth company, and all these companies are still growing nicely within Salesforce. These deals are still relevant. ... They're part of this new chapter of Salesforce as a growth company rather than a hyper-growth company.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 0.91, it raises the question: is the stock significantly overvalued? This article seeks to answer this question through an in-depth valuation analysis. We invite you to join us as we unravel the intrinsic value of PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG).Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PCG. Click here to check it out. PCG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PCGPG&amp;E Corp (NYSE:PCG) is a holding company whose main subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric, operates in Central and Northern California. Serving 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties, PG&amp;E has a significant presence in the regulated utility industry. The company's history includes a period of bankruptcy court supervision from January 2019 to June 2020 and the sale of its unregulated assets in 2004. Despite its challenges, PG&amp;E has a market cap of $40.70 billion and a current stock price of $16.26, which is higher than its GF Value of $12.34.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides a visual representation of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to this valuation method, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) appears to be significantly overvalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.Story continuesPG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing its shares. Key indicators such as the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide an initial perspective on the company's financial health. PG&amp;E has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01, ranking worse than 95.45% of 484 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This poor ranking suggests that PG&amp;E's financial strength is questionable.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthConsistent profitability over the long term reduces the risk for investors. PG&amp;E has been profitable for six of the past ten years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $22.30 billion and an EPS of $0.91. However, its operating margin of 9.35% ranks worse than 56.89% of 501 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a vital factor in a company's valuation. The faster a company grows, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Unfortunately, PG&amp;E's 3-year average annual revenue growth rate is -32.1%, ranking worse than 98.76% of 484 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0%, ranking worse than 0% of 459 companies in the same industry.Return on Invested Capital Vs. Weighted Average Cost of CapitalComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, PG&amp;E's ROIC is 7.59, and its WACC is 5.98.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn summary, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) appears to be significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is poor, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 0% of 459 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 1.06%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of -3.1%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of PG&amp;E Corp.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PCG. Click here to check it out. PCG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PCGPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 5/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 1/105. Momentum rank: 6/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned PG&amp;E Corp the GF Score of 52 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Snapshot of PG&amp;E Corp's BusinessPG&amp;E Corp, with a market cap of $40.9 billion, is a holding company whose main subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric. This regulated utility operates in Central and Northern California, serving 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties. PG&amp;E operated under bankruptcy court supervision between January 2019 and June 2020. In 2004, PG&amp;E sold its unregulated assets as part of an earlier post-bankruptcy reorganization. The company's sales stand at $22.26 billion with an operating margin of 9.35%.Story continuesPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.89 positions it worse than 93.93% of 428 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.44, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.35, which is worse than 89.69% of 456 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 8.18, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 83.14% of 439 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Profitability AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. PG&amp;E Corp's Operating Margin has declined over the past five years ((-22.59%)), as shown by the following data: 2018: 12.36; 2019: 7.83; 2020: 10.86; 2021: 10.37; 2022: 9.57; .Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where PG&amp;E Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -32.1 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 98.76% of 484 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, PG&amp;E Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.PG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While PG&amp;E Corp has a rich history in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its current financial indicators and growth prospects suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance. As value investors, it's crucial to consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Our financial outlook excludes stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related compensation costs, restructuring charges and gains on strategic investments, which cannot be determined at this time and are, therefore, not reconciled in today's press release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tomer Weingarten, CEO of SentinelOne.Story continuesTomer WeingartenGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal second quarter earnings call. We reported strong second quarter results and exceeded our expectations on all key metrics, including ARR, revenue, gross margin and operating margin. We're also raising our outlook for revenue and margins for the fiscal year '24. I'm proud of the resilience, dedication and execution of our teams. Our performance also reflects the progress we are making towards enhancing business processes, operations and cost discipline. We pioneered the world's first purpose-built AI-powered cybersecurity platform to deliver autonomous defense for the enterprise. We introduced the industry to the first-ever autonomous AI agent with a fully integrated data and security platform and self-healing capabilities. We've established a noble and transformative approach to cybersecurity, a unified data and security platform across attack vectors. Once again, we're leading the industry by incorporating generative AI into cybersecurity through Purple AI, supercharging security operations. Superior technology is the foundation of how we help our partners and our customers build more resilient enterprises with streamlined operations, less product complexity, best-in-class security and a leading return on investment. Our competitive success is the direct result of our innovation and technology leadership. We're in the early innings of taking market share and mind share of a massive $100 billion addressable market, ripe for disruption. As always, please read our shareholder letter published on the Investor Relations website, which provides more detail. Let's review the details of our second quarter performance, which exceeded our top and bottom line expectations. Our ARR grew by 47% year-over-year to $612 million, reflecting net new ARR of $49 million in the quarter. Our gross margin reached a new record of 77%. Since our IPO just 2 years ago, we've expanded our gross margin by more than 20 percentage points. We're now operating within our long-term gross margin target range. This important achievement reflects the scalability of our business model, driven by our strong unit economics and price discipline. We're making significant progress in improving our operating and free cash flow margins. We proactively streamlined our cost structure to ensure our path to profitability. Our operating margin expanded by 34 percentage points, driven by higher scale and cost discipline. We've delivered margin improvement at a staggering pace. Q2 marked our eighth consecutive quarter of more than 25 percentage points of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Let me also highlight the remarkable improvement we've made to our free cash flow profile, delivering 55 percentage points of expansion compared to just a year ago. The level of margin improvement we're delivering is a rarity among public companies. With strong liquidity of more than $1 billion in cash and equivalents, we will build on this progress. We're confident in achieving positive free cash flow in the second half of our next fiscal year. Looking beyond key financial metrics, our competitive differentiation and superior platform value is resonating with customers. We continue to win in a significant majority of competitive evaluations. Our win rates remain strong, including against large next-gen competitors. Our single platform architecture helps enterprises consolidate spend, point products and consoles. We're addressing the most important needs to enterprises, reducing complexity, streamlining operating efficiency and delivering better security, all through AI and automation. I'm especially pleased with the positive feedback from our customers. As captured by Gartner Peer Insights, hundreds of customers provided favorable feedback on the Singularity platform. We achieved top 2 ranking not only in DDR, but also in MDR and cloud workload protection categories, outperforming even the largest vendors in the space. As evidenced by these results, our technology delivers on our promise to our customers. In Q2, we added about 700 new customers, and our total customer base now exceeds 11,000. Remember that this number does not include the customers served by our MSSP partners, so it is understated, especially as more enterprises turn to MSSPs for many security services. Customers with more than $100,000 in ARR grew 37% year-over-year, much faster than our total customer growth, and customers with more than $1 million in ARR grew even faster. Our momentum with large enterprises and platform adoption continues to drive higher ARR per customer. In Q2, we secured many large customer wins across U.S. federal agencies to global health care companies and technology pioneers spanning both endpoint and cloud footprints. Our Singularity platform helps enterprises simplify cybersecurity by consolidating multiple vendors in disjointed platforms. Let me highlight 2 examples. First, a large enterprise selected our unified platform to replace a total of 7 different security vendors, including the 2 largest endpoint vendors. The security team at this enterprise was grappling with the challenge of managing multiple solutions and consoles. Following hands-on experience, the customer selected our Singularity platform for EDR with 5 additional modules. Through autonomous protection in a single console, we deliver better security and superior customer experience. In another multimillion dollar win from the quarter, a global health care enterprise selected SentinelOne unified platform to integrate multiple-security ecosystem products and bring them together, replacing the closed garden approach of their incumbent vendor. The customer valued SentinelOne's open platform that unites security data and actions, future-proofing their enterprise security posture. Our platform approach continues to be a source of growth through expansion, driving a net retention rate of more than 115%. As a reminder, our NRR now includes legacy products from the acquisition of Ativo Networks a year ago. The inclusion of Ativo and macro-driven budgetary constraints are impacting our near-term expansion rate. We believe this is temporary. Over the long term, we see significant platform expansion potential based on high customer retention rates, expanding product categories and early-stage adoption from our installed base. Our NRR expansion was driven by continued license and module adoption. Singularity cloud remained our fastest-growing solution in Q2, followed by strong contributions from Singularity Data Lake, Vigilance MDR and Ranger. Overall, module adoption remains a meaningful opportunity for growth, and we're beginning to see opportunities for large security data deals and other massive market opportunity that is ripe for disruption. Our platform solutions beyond endpoint continue to drive more than 1/3 of our quarterly bookings in Q2, illustrating the diversity of our business mix. On to our partner ecosystem. We achieved another quarter of standout growth with our MSSP partners in Q2. Businesses are increasingly turning to managed security to elevate protection, address cybersecurity talent shortages and better align cost structures. Despite recent macro-related industry headwinds, the demand for managed security remains strong. Our large partners continue to expand their business with SentinelOne through additional licenses and modules. In a multimillion dollar deal from the quarter, we quadrupled our business with a fast-growing MSSP partner compared to just a year ago. From the beginning, we've built our business by enabling our partners instead of competing with them. Our differentiated platform capabilities such as multi-tenancy, automation and remote management makes SentinelOne a foundational platform for MSSPs who are building their practices on top of our technology. One of our strategic partners, Pax8, recently recognized SentinelOne's significant impact with its Pax8 Most Valuable Vendor Award. We're still in the early innings of a massive business expansion opportunity with our MSSP partners. Overall, our quarterly performance reflects strong execution by our teams. Our proactive efforts to enhance operational efficiencies are showing measurable improvements. We've expedited our deal, closed processes and cash collections all while growing the average deal size. Over the last few years, our product portfolio has evolved from endpoint to a broad security platform covering endpoint, cloud identity and data. Similarly, our go-to-market framework is evolving towards a full enterprise-wide security platform. The actions we've undertaken are yielding positive results, but there's always more work to be done. As we continue our journey towards surpassing $1 billion in ARR and achieving profitability, our focus remain on continuously sharpening our execution, from training and enablement to support and services. We're in a terrific position to disrupt the $100 billion security and data market opportunity, and we're raising our full year growth and margin guidance to reflect a stronger outlook and better execution. Let's turn the discussion to the market environment and the wave of secular tailwinds behind cybersecurity. Global macroeconomic conditions and the broader demand environment remained consistent with the trends we discussed last quarter. Enterprises continue to rightsize their security investments based on near-term budget constraints. We've seen a proliferation of cyber incidents, new software vulnerabilities and an uptick in the use of AI-based attack methods. The evolving cyber threat landscape and sophistication of modern attacks have exposed the shortcomings of key cybersecurity vendors and reinforced the structural importance of AI-powered autonomous scalable security. In a recent cyber incident linked to China, attackers gained access to user authentications, opening the door to a range of Microsoft applications and services. In addition to the vulnerability a Microsoft Defender couldn't defend, the hackers were able to use the stolen keys to access government and corporate accounts. It's no surprise. Microsoft Solutions are known to be riddled with vulnerabilities, which are accompanied by cybersecurity that has been repeatedly breached. Lawmakers and security experts are questioning the significant shortcomings of Microsoft's cybersecurity and are asking for an investigation into the company's security practices. Numerous incidents such as this underscore that inadequate and legacy security solutions are exposing enterprises to enormous cost business disruptions and brand reputation concerns. Increasingly, cybersecurity is an executive and board level priority as governments begin to require high level of oversight and disclosure. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission established new rules to require a public company to regularly disclose matters related to cybersecurity risk and to report material cybersecurity incidents. All of this, once again, shine the spotlight on the structural importance of a blazing-fast and AI-driven cybersecurity platform as well as the collection and retention of all enterprise log data. In today's evolving threat landscape, point solutions are falling out of favor. Security vendors that focus on a narrow set of data sources or attack vectors are unable to furnish comprehensive and cost-effective protection. Customers are seeking to consolidate not only their security vendors, but also the security consoles and data in order to gain a unified view of the enterprise security landscape. Enterprises need a specialized security approach centered on all enterprise data to prevent attacks. Our autonomous technology brings this vision to life with a unified AI-based security analytics platform that seamlessly aggregates and connects data from all security products to deliver enterprise-wide visibility in a single streamlined technology and interface. We eliminate the need to operate disjointed platforms. As attacks move beyond a single surface, it's imperative to tie together telemetry logs from key security products. Singularity Data Lake is the only unified platform in the market that is able to bring together full fidelity logs and visibility from all key sources for enterprise security, like e-mail security, identity access management, firewalls, SASE providers and others. Frost &amp; Sullivan recently ranked SentinelOne as the XDR Growth Index Leader, ahead of all the security vendors evaluated. I'm proud of our leading AI-based technology and the innovations we're bringing to customers. Our newly launched vulnerability management solution, Ranger Insights, is another example of how we're helping customers eliminate disparate tools in a single platform. Ranger Insights connects 2 closely tied elements of cybersecurity, application vulnerability identification and endpoint mitigation, which were disconnected until now. CRN ranked Ranger Insights as the #1 in their list of Cool New Security Products Unveiled at Black Hat 2023. We also introduced a new cloud data security product line, which offers threat detection for customers using cloud storage vendors like Amazon S3 and network storage providers such as NetApp. On top of delivering industry-leading workload protection, we're expanding our cloud security product suite to include capabilities like cloud vulnerability management to asset discovery and visibility, making Singularity Cloud one of the broadest CNA platforms to have end-to-end functionality, from runtime protection to data security. Last but not least, building upon our success in delivering best-in-class autonomous security, we're extending our lead by bringing generative AI to security professionals. Purple AI transformed security operations by supercharging users to control all aspects of enterprise security, from visibility to response, with unmatched speed and efficiency. This is much more than a sidecar system. It can upgrade any security analyst to superhuman levels. We expect this to be a significant source of expansion and growth in the future. At the Black Hat conference earlier this month, thousands of visitors eagerly discovered the capabilities of Purple AI and engage in immersive, interactive hands-on product demos. The best way for companies to prevent cyberattacks is to leverage the best security, and SentinelOne delivers it. Our innovations and holistic approach to cybersecurity puts us in a strong position for long-term growth across multiple large addressable markets, including endpoint, cloud, identity and data. In closing, I extend my gratitude to our incredible team despite a persistently challenging macro environment, Sentinels across the world rose to the occasion, addressing critical enterprise needs with the most disruptive technology on the market. I also thank our valued customers, partners and shareholders for their support and trust. We remain focused on the long-term opportunity and maximizing our business potential. With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Bernhardt, our Chief Financial Officer.David BernhardtThank you, Tomer. Today, I'll discuss our quarterly financials and provide additional context about our guidance for Q3 and fiscal year '24. As a reminder, all comparisons are year-over-year and all margins discussed are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered high top line growth and substantial margin expansion. Revenue grew 46% in the second quarter, and our ARR grew 47% to $612 million. We added net new ARR of $49 million in the quarter, achieving strong sequential growth of 17%. Our growth was also balanced across geographies, with higher growth in Europe and Asia. Revenue from international markets grew 57%, representing 36% of revenue. We continue to achieve a healthy mix of new customers and existing customer expansion. In addition, our momentum with large enterprises, SMBs and MSSP partners remain strong, which continues to fuel a solid base of long-term growth. As a result, our ARR per customer increased both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum with large enterprises and broader platform adoption. We're taking market share from incumbent and next-gen vendors, and our second quarter performance signifies our competitive strength in enterprise demand for best-in-class cybersecurity. Before turning to our costs and margins, I'd like to provide an update related to the ARR adjustment we announced in Q1. After conducting a comprehensive review, we implemented robust controls, improved processes and enhanced our ARR reporting structure. In addition, we partnered with a big 4 accounting firm to objectively validate our processes and controls. Our systems are fully remediated, and we're glad this issue is behind us. Looking beyond the top line growth. Our gross margin reached a new record of 77% in Q2, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5 percentage points. Just 2 years after setting our long-term gross margin target of 75% to 80% of the IPO, we're already operating well within that range. We're seeing continued benefits from economies of scale, data processing efficiencies and cross-sell from adjacent solutions, and our pricing remains healthy. We have taken a highly differentiated approach to unifying our security and data architecture into a single platform, which delivers real value for us and our customers. Our record gross margin demonstrates the success of our land and expand strategy and platform unit economics, where we collect data once and enable more and more capabilities, powered by our proprietary fully integrated security data lake. We also delivered substantial operating margin improvement, expanding over 34 percentage points year-over-year to negative 22%. As market conditions evolved, we became even more selective about our investments and took important steps to align our cost structure, including our previously announced workforce optimization. The efforts we have made are paying off. On a dollar basis, we reduced our operating losses by over 40 percentage points in Q2. We also significantly reduced our free cash outflow from $67 million in Q2 of last year to just $15 million this quarter, which reflects an outstanding free cash flow margin improvement of 55 percentage points. This is the result of our proactive efforts to improve working capital and effective cost management. To further demonstrate this, our total cash and equivalents and investments balance reduced by only $2 million in Q2 and only $5 million year-to-date in fiscal '24. In short, our losses and cash burn have rapidly narrowed, and we are steadily marching towards positive free cash flow and profitability. Moving to our guidance for Q3 and the full fiscal year '24. We expect global economic conditions in a broader demand environment to remain consistent with the trends we discussed last quarter as enterprises continue to rightsize their security investments based on near-term budget constraints. Even with this as the market backdrop, we're raising our revenue and margin expectations for fiscal year '24. Our teams are executing well, our win rates remain strong, and we are delivering operating leverage. In Q3, we expect revenue of about $156 million, reflecting growth of 35% year-over-year. Based on this view, we expect Q3 net new ARR to be comparable to Q2 levels, which is consistent with the typical seasonality and still comes on top of our Q2 outperformance. For the full year, we expect revenue of about $605 million, reflecting growth of 43% in fiscal year '24, a $10 million increase compared to the prior midpoint of $595 million. Based on this view, we expect full year ARR to grow in the high 30% range, adding about $195 million in net new ARR in fiscal year '24. This is a higher ARR growth rate compared to our prior expectation of mid-30%. Based on our go-to-market and pipeline momentum, we feel confident in our ability to deliver against our Q3 and our stronger full year growth targets. Importantly, we're seeing durability in new business generation and the trajectory of growth rates. We're encouraged by increasing platform adoption and competitive position, offering diverse and meaningful growth opportunities for years to come. Turning to the outlook for margins. We expect Q3 gross margin of about 76%, implying a year-over-year increase of more than 4 percentage points. On a constant currency basis, our Q3 gross margin expectation is consistent with Q2. Also for the full year, we are raising our gross margin guidance to 76%, up about 4 percentage points year-over-year and up 150 basis points when compared to our prior guided midpoint of 74.5%. We've taken a major step forward as a company by achieving our long-term gross margin target range and expect continued benefits from increasing scale and data efficiencies inherent in our business model to drive higher gross margins over time. Finally, for operating margin, we expect negative 22% in Q3, implying an improvement of more than 20 percentage points year-over-year. For the full year, we are raising our guidance for operating margin to about negative 25%, up 2 percentage points compared to the prior midpoint and at the better end of our previous annual guidance. This implies a notable improvement of more than 24 percentage points compared to fiscal year '23. We've made significant investments in innovation and talent development over the past few years. This gives us ample runway to deliver against our product road map and growth targets. We also expect continued benefits from cost management initiatives and operating leverage of our business. We have a very strong balance sheet with more than $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and no debt. This provides durability, flexibility and an independent path to generating positive cash flows. Our goal is to optimize top line growth with consistent margin improvement. On our journey to achieving profitability, we don't intend to sacrifice growth or market share. Our investment approach will remain highly selective and focused on key areas of competitive strength. We're delivering industry-leading margin improvement and steadily approaching positive free cash flow generation. We remain steadfast on our path to achieving profitability in fiscal year '25. Thank you all for joining today. We will now take questions. Operator, please open up the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ray McDonough with Guggenheim Securities.Raymond Michael McDonoughTomer, congratulations on a good quarter here and what seems to be an improvement. But I think the question on a lot of investors' minds here is the reports that SentinelOne is seeking or at least evaluating strategic alternatives. Can you comment on that process? And then separately, can you comment on the partnership or the termination of the partnership with Wiz. When that was first announced, I think there was some excitement, not only from investors, but also from your field partners and the channel. So just curious how you're thinking about those 2 things and how you're thinking about your own road map in cloud security now that you've terminated that partnership.Tomer WeingartenWe don't comment on rumors or speculation, but let me be clear. I mean our focus is on building an independent company for the long term. We're delivering substantial growth and margin improvement. And most importantly, we have the best technology and a clear strategic road map to disrupt a $100 billion market, with the potential to multiply our current market share in the coming years. I think also our teams are executing well. Competitive positioning remains incredibly strong. We delivered excellent results. All in all, I think you're just seeing us being laser-focused on delivering the best innovation we can, the best protection we can for our customers, maximizing our business potential. We believe we can do that the best as possible as a public independent transparent company. And I think that is as clear as I can be. On the Wiz thing, if you kind of bundle it on the acquisition rumors and all that stuff, I mean, again, I'm not going to comment on that, but it's all pure speculation on their part and far from fact. So it's, again, a head scratcher to me. If we kind of pivot to the partnership, we did not terminate the partnership. I think that's again misconstrued. We actually canceled a reseller agreement, a reselling agreement. So we still partner with Wiz. We still work with them on the field level. We still think there's some form of complementary technology there, and we're focused on delivering customer outcomes. So when customers want to use Wiz, we'll support that. The technical integration is still there. Wiz is a nice little startup. We like working with them. But again, in terms of the reselling agreement, we didn't see any contribution from that. We didn't feel like that's something that is fulfilled on their end, so we decided to terminate that. Our cloud-native application platform is growing, I think, in a stellar pace. We're definitely ahead of our targets. We just announced cloud data security. That's a major expansion to our workload protection platform that's part of that overall [scheme], that envelope. And we want ourselves to be focused on our own capabilities, and I think that's natural. We're also seeing tremendous traction in that market. Obviously, triple-digit growth for our cloud business year-over-year for a few good quarters now and a couple of years now is obviously giving us a lot of confidence that we can continue and grow that, and we'll continue to develop our own native capabilities alongside that.OperatorOur next question is from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.Robbie David OwensI want to drill down a little bit into retention rates. And I know there was commentary in the shareholder letter, excuse me, around the Ativo legacy products. So if you could just kind of clarify what exactly those are? And do we still expect the 120 level to be a floor as we move forward? Or could you see additional pressure?Tomer WeingartenYes. I think what you're seeing with the net retention rate is something that's industry-wide. I don't think it's unique to us. I think we do -- we do see our own, call it, natural retention rates still being incredibly high, even in light of macro factors generally causing customers to be much more prudent about their spend and their timing also of expansion. Ativo legacy product, as you can imagine, with any acquisition, there's some degree of customer churn. And that happens typically for the kind of older product lines. Identity security, obviously, is the shining spot. I mean, we continuously grow that. It's a big contributor to all revenue outside of endpoint. But things like deception, which is very, very interesting, industry-specific, I think that sometimes we don't put all the focus on. We continue to support the specific customers that use these legacy products. But we're much more focused on identity security, active directory assessment, all these more forward-looking products that came with that acquisition and obviously are today integrated into our platform.OperatorOur next question is from Brian Essex with JPMorgan.Brian Lee EssexCongrats on a much better result this quarter. Tomer, I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit -- digging a little bit more on the competitive environment. I think you previously talked about, or at least have commented on, win rates relative to both Microsoft and CrowdStrike. Any changes in the competitive environment? And then kind of adjacent to that question, how do you think about growth of sales and marketing expense as you have this kind of tremendous market opportunity ahead of you? And you're obviously balancing investment in sales and marketing, market penetration, but also you're delivering some pretty impressive margin expansion in the process. So those 2 segments would be really helpful to better understand.Tomer WeingartenOur competitive position, I think, is improving. I mean, we were seeing now meaningful differentiation on the technology front. Everybody likes to make all sorts of statements about how unified your platform is or isn't. We're the only platform out there that actually delivers on that promise. I think that, to us, that becomes more and more meaningful as customers are looking to gain enterprise-wide visibility, and they want to do it. They want to do it with 1 console. They want to do it with one language. They want to do it with one interface. That is not what our competitors are selling into the market. I think if you want to talk about competitors, let's also talk about the blatant misrepresentations they had on their earnings call made so clearly. I think it's unbelievable that you see them calling out or implying that we are a point product company when it's plain to see that we're the broadest platform out there. When they call themselves a unified platform, but actually have 2 distinctively different platforms, 2 consoles, 2 languages, 2 product lines, that's an overt misrepresentation and that confuses customers. I think it's just shocking to see that. When they say that the only generative AI company to demo generative AI at conference shows, that's also a blatant lie. I mean, obviously, we've been the first to demo that. There are other vendors that have demoed that. Everybody is giving live demos. We actually gave hands-on live demos. So if we talk about the competition, I think it's important to separate fact from all these rumors and speculations and misrepresentations. And our competitive positioning, our technology is true. I think that's what customers are getting into their hands. That the reason we win. That's the reason why we continue to grow market share.OperatorOur next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham.Alexander HendersonNice rebound in the quarter. Clearly, if you'd listen, and I'm sure you did, to the CrowdStrike presentation, they delineated the scale and some of the growth rates around some of their products. And I was hoping maybe you could take a page out of their book and give us some of the -- some granularity around some of these key products that you call out, whether it be the cloud product, Vigilance, to the Ranger, pick your category.Tomer WeingartenI think at our scale, I mean, we're not at a point that we're ready to disclose that. I think we're giving you good indications as to what part of our portfolio is growing. We're giving you an indication that more than 30% of our revenue contribution is coming from outside of endpoint. We're giving an indication we gave last quarter that cloud is growing incredibly fast, triple digit year-over-year represents well over 20% of quarterly ACVs on average, if you kind of look at the rearview mirror in the last 12 months. So all in all, I think that can give you some sense. I also think that, for us, data analytics and security data lake, the Singularity Data Lake, these capabilities are just coming online. And they're coming online pretty fast. So hopefully, as we gain a little bit more scale, I think we'll be able to disclose much more on how we look at our business. But right now, obviously, we're just focused on growing as fast as we can between these core TAMs that we identified are strategic to our growth.OperatorOur next question is from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.Andrew James NowinskiGreat. Congrats on the nice quarter. Nice rebound. So I wanted to ask about net new ARR, maybe particularly the guidance for Q3. I understand the year-over-year decline in Q2 given the tough comp you had from last year. But if you think about all the positive trends you guys described here today, why wouldn't you expect maybe more growth out of net new ARR in Q3 given that the macro really hasn't changed? It hasn't gotten worse or better, I guess, is what I meant.David BernhardtSure. We just exceeded our Q2 net new ARR expectation by double digits. We raised our Q3 net new ARR outlook, and we raised the full ARR growth to the high 30s. So I think the way to think about it is we're just being thoughtful about macro stabilization, which is still evolving. And I think we just believe that being prudent is the right approach in our view.OperatorOur next question is from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.Gabriela BorgesTomer, I wanted to ask a question on some of the feedback you're getting from customers that are trying the new Purple product. What are the 1 or 2 asks that are coming out of those trials in terms of the next 1 or 2 features that customers want in a product? And how are you thinking about the pricing model over the medium term?Tomer WeingartenYes. The first question is always what's the pricing. I think that's consistently what we're hearing from them. And we're starting to share, and I most actually would say we're testing pricing with these customers. So I don't have kind of a flushed out pricing model to give you just yet. But it's definitely something that we're kind of processing right now. I think in terms of the request, and that is key, is that we continue and push Purple to be an overarching enterprise-wide algorithm versus being focused just on endpoint data or just on cloud data. And that, once again, comes back to the level of differentiation that you see with our platform today. When you think about some of these AI capabilities, when you think about the scale you can achieve with AI, you obviously want to start stitching together all these disparate products, all these siloed ecosystem vendors into one cohesive fabric that can also allow you to, in some cases, consolidate the waste of these products. But in some other cases, these products are still going to be there, but you want to make sure that something more intelligent is driving them and that you can orchestrate action. So people want us to do it on an enterprise scale. People want us to do it in a highly autonomous manner and in a highly actionable manner. They don't want more suggestions. They don't want more chatbots, they want predictive algorithms that can allow them in real time to react to what they're seeing enterprise-wide. And I think that's exactly how we're developing Purple. That's exactly the first iteration of this product. And all in all, it looks just very promising.OperatorOur next question is from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen.Shaul EyalGood to see the bounce back. Dave, a question for you. Can you discuss gross margins the improvement actually vis-a-vis what do you see in terms of ASP pressures?David BernhardtYes. Obviously, there's not ASP pressures, or we wouldn't be setting record gross margins. So I guess, let's start with that. We had record gross margin this quarter of 77%. I think that's a benefit of our increasing scale, the data processing efficiencies and the module cross-sell, which we also expect will continue over time. So I think we're proud of the gain we've had in gross margin and just don't seem to be seeing the ASP issues that other competitors may be seeing.OperatorOur next question is from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank.Patrick Edwin Ronald ColvilleSo I mean this quarter, the operating margin improvement was really impressive in my model. So you beat this quarter. You lifted fiscal '20 margin by 2 points. But that means in my model, if I'm counting it correctly, but my actual 4Q number comes down for operating margin. So like why would that be? It's probably one question. And then how should we think about your kind of like long-term guidance for fiscal '25 and your goal to reach operating margin profitability next year?David BernhardtSo we raised our full year EBIT margin, like you said, by 2 points at the midpoint. It's the better end of our annual guidance. Now we've focused on that. Instead of 25% to 29% loss, we're focused on the 25%. We believe that's meaningful. We're on track for 25 points or about 25 points of operating margin improvement this year. I think one of the things we're seeing coming off as strong, too, in Q2 is also should we be investing into some things where we're seeing benefits. So our second half is expecting some of that. We're able to do all of that and improve the guidance for the year to the better end of anything we were expecting for the year at the start. So we're proud of this guidance. We're always going to balance our investments in growth with our commitment to achieving profitability. And our goal remains unchanged for next year, but we'll be guiding that in the future.OperatorOur next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.Adam Tyler TindleHope to get a 2-parter in, Dave. First, a clarification. On NRR with the Ativo piece, is there any way that you could potentially help us quantify so that we could strip that piece out? I'm just curious what the underlying trends would have looked like for the health of the business ex that.And then Tomer, as a follow-up, I know we kind of touched on the Wiz subject. But curious, cloud security is obviously one of your fastest-growing areas. It sounds like you're still committed to that partnership. But honestly, why? That piece of the business is growing so rapidly. You've got a broad platform. Where do they fit in? What do you -- honestly, what do you need them for?David BernhardtI'll start. Our NRR on an organic basis would have been 120%. So it's still at the expectations that we've set forth in prior earnings calls. So the 5% decrement was purely Ativo. I'll let Tomer answer the other question.Tomer WeingartenYes. One way is -- I thought I kind of said it, it's really what the customer wants. And obviously, they got a nice set of customers, kind of in the Fortune 100. We want to make sure that we support them. Some of them are our customers, too. We want to make sure we deliver the best experience. So when a customer wants to use Wiz, by all means, and we will be there to support it. When a customer wants something more holistic, obviously, we will serve our own. I think there's also a big difference between what they can serve, which is highly limited to public cloud. Where, if you look at our platform and our workload protection, we cater to folks from on-prem environments and server and workload environments that might be on-premise, all the way to private cloud and then to public cloud. So it's also a slightly different use case. But I think what you can kind of gather about SentinelOne is that we're very partner-friendly. No matter who the partner is, we are guided by what customers want to do. And we will always stand by that, and we will always support customers. So in that, we -- Wiz is another great partner of ours from many other partners that we have. So there's no reason for us not to partner with them.OperatorOur next question is from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.Patrick O'NeillThis is Patrick on for Josh. So you mentioned last quarter, after the adjustments to ARR, that the revenue-to-ARR correlation should be tighter moving forward. But if you look at that historical delta, it actually ticked up a bit here in 2Q from 1Q and is a little closer to what we saw last year. So curious, did you see some shrink come back in that consumption part of the business? And then has anything changed from last quarter with how you factored that consumption part into the guidance?David BernhardtI'd say we're still very closely aligned. I think revenue increase year-over-year was 47%, and the ARR was 46%. And I'd say, that's pretty close. So we expect that to continue to be aligned for the rest of the year.OperatorOur next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays.Saket KaliaTomer, I kind of have a 2-part question for you, if I may. The first one is on the competitive environment. I know we talked about the other endpoint player out there, but I want to ask specifically on Microsoft. One of the things that came out on another conference call was maybe you're starting to see customers question the real price, the real underlying price of Microsoft Defender. Do you agree with that? Are you hearing that from customers? That's the first part. The second part of the question is more of an industry question on CNAP. There are endpoint players that have CNAP, there are firewall players that have CNAP and then there are individual vendors that have CNAP. What are you hearing from customers on their preference to buy from one category versus another? Is there a natural, I don't know, tendency to buy from an endpoint or from a firewall vendor? Or is that still something that's being determined?Tomer WeingartenSo on Microsoft, we definitely see more customers starting to understand that the lack of price transparency is causing them to actually overpay for what they would actually get from another vendor at a lower price point. I mean if you bundle together the workload pricing, the login pricing, the service pricing, all of that together comes up to a pretty hefty price tag if you're going with Microsoft. And I think we can all agree not to best-of-breed security. So we're definitely seeing more of that. I think there is a slight dynamic change there. I wouldn't call any of that right now transformative or thesis-changing. I think it's just starting to trickle. I think if you couple that with the fact that not only Microsoft is not the cheapest solution, Microsoft also doesn't really care as much about customers just under sheer scale, right? I mean, we're talking about a complete different level of support if you're going with a stand-alone cybersecurity provider like our -- like us and some of our peers. I think you're just getting a completely different level of service, and that is something that is also starting to resonate with customers out there. And lastly, I think it's just the complexity. Microsoft has a lot of different ingredients in what they call security. It's not one platform. It's a bundle of solutions, and I think that also matters significantly. If we want to touch on CNAP, I think your observation is 100% correct. And I think that a lot of folks gravitated towards the stand-alone CNAP vendors on the back of just great UI. I think there's no deep IP in CNAP. Inventory, attack graph visualization, like all these things, that's not AI, that's not deep IP. And I think that's where you're seeing this commoditization where everybody is coming up with their own capabilities to achieve that. And I think it really is what flavor that the customer wants to go with. And once again, we're flexible. I mean if you want to get that out of us, we will definitely build the best platform that we can. But if you rather have a different flavor, that's fine, too. We're focusing where there's deep technology. And workload protection, run time protection, this is where you can actually and meaningfully differentiate. This is non-commoditized. This is where our years of research, supporting Linux environments, containerized environments, bringing best-of-breed telemetry, best-of-breed performance, that's where it matters. And that's where we win the most. And that's why that remains our focus as we build these other capabilities to get to this holistic approach to cloud security. But once again, you get different flavors of customers. You're going to get pure public cloud customers. You're going to get private cloud customers. You're going to get on-prem workload customers. It's not one size fits all. And some of these stand-alone offerings, they're not really relevant in any other setting other than a public cloud setting.OperatorOur next question is from Trevor Walsh with JMP Securities.Trevor James WalshTomer, on the subject of the Ranger Insights that you announced earlier in the month, can you just walk us through maybe what the kind of, I guess, 1.0 or first type of -- how that opportunity looks initially vis-a-vis kind of other players in that vulnerability management space and then kind of where you're looking to maybe go with that product and kind of what the opportunity looks like kind of in 6, 12 months?Tomer WeingartenYes. I mean great traction already. I think it's something that we kind of vetted and built with customers. And it's focused on identifying vulnerabilities, prioritizing vulnerabilities and allowing you to gain full context on vulnerabilities, together with endpoint data in one same place. And given that most vulnerabilities actually lie on endpoints and servers, it really is a very, very natural place for it to live together. And now we're working on adding more and more remediation capabilities that can inform you. Once you get informed on a vulnerability, you can automatically remediate it. So I think for a lot of these vendors right now in that space using all kinds of scanning tools, and you need to deploy another agent, and sometimes you need an incumbent vendor that adds just another overhead on the machine with us. I mean, if you're an existing customer, you're just getting it. It's already there. And I think the most important part of it is that it's also done in a complete continuous manner. So this is not a onetime skin type of a thing. It's a continuous profile of your environment. And we can highlight all these vulnerabilities the moment that they pop up, and we can offer up remediation the moment that something pops up. So to me, it's a very natural expansion. It's a great little TAM that we can now also serve between $5 billion to $7 billion. And it's just, again, something that we believe will streamline operations significantly for a lot of customers out there. The one last thing I want to say about this is that it's also highly strategic for our MSSP segment. The MSSP partners are always looking for ways to get to better hygiene, to patch customer machines. And by allowing them to use the same remote management platform that they're using today, our SentinelOne Singularity platform, to now also cover vulnerabilities, we're lying for extreme cost efficiency for them and obviously an avenue for expansion. So strategic on both fronts, and we're very, very proud of launching vulnerability management into our endpoint management suite.OperatorOur next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.Jonathan Frank HoJust wanted to understand a little bit better, if you could give us some more detail around the significant improvement around your sales execution and performance. I guess my question is what's made the most difference? And where are we in terms of those improvements? Is there sort of further opportunities ahead as well?Tomer WeingartenWe're always working to improve. To us, this never ends. I think just better scrutiny, better training, better enablement, better pipeline sourcing, better interaction with our channel, all of that, I think, funnel to just better execution. Some technical elements like contract execution, all of that has been streamlined, better systems in place. I mean, we've done a lot in the course of 90 days to elevate our performance, and still a lot remains to be done. I think we're only going to get better from here. The important part is that we got a great seller DNA in our sales force. We have worked to diversify our sales force. We're now selling into 4 different distinct TAMs. We wanted sellers with cloud DNA. We wanted sellers with data DNA. We're now building those disciplines. And that obviously allows us to treat all these adjacent growth opportunities in such a tailored manner and that creates, I think, just better execution, better win rates, better conversion rates on our pipeline. So all in all, again, continued work, but I think we're doing all the right things.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.Daniel ReaganIt's Daniel on for Mike. So you called out another standout quarter with your MSSP partners. Just wanted to see if you could provide some color on sort of what's resonating in this part of your business, especially as it pertains to some of your newer emerging modules you guys highlighted.Tomer WeingartenAbsolutely. I think, first and foremost, it's still the core elements of our platform. The ability to manage multiple, sometimes thousands of customers in one single-click console is still a very unique capability in this space. So as our MSSP partners kind of look to grow, look to add more customers, they can do it with ease, they can do it with confidence. And obviously, they're well trained on our platform to date. So the elements of automation and manageability are first and foremost, I think, why we have that strong footprint in the MSSP realm. The other elements of what we do, like MDR, which they're adopting now and reselling to their customer base, is also a nice expansion opportunity for us, where a lot of our MSSP partners want even more tailored security for their customers, and they're leveraging our own MDR services as a resell to their partner base. Cloud security is coming online for some of these partners, again, covering server environments. We've actually tapped through a lot of server environments, and they tapped those so far with endpoint licenses. We're now converting those into server licenses. If you kind of think about the Ranger and Ranger Insights module, they've already been onboarded on Ranger, which allows them for asset discovery. We're seeing traction with that. Ranger Insights will catapult that even further. Again, vulnerability management is a very natural expansion to what they do. So all in all, with the MSSP environment, I would say the opportunity is twofold. It's the modules. There's no question that we're still underpenetrated. But at the same time, we're also underpenetrated on licenses, seat counts in a number of endpoints. A lot of our MSSP partners still have a huge potential in their estate, and we're working with them every day to expand our footprint and to make sure that they are as competitive as they can be.OperatorOur last question is from Eric Heath with KeyBanc.Eric Michael HeathTomer, I did enjoy seeing the Purple AI demo, I'd say, back in April. It was impressive. So I wanted to ask you what your thoughts are on timing for that to become available? And then coming back to the CNAP question, just Curious if there's any change in the way you're thinking about either adding or not adding CSPM or application security capabilities to that platform?Tomer WeingartenYes. Good. Glad you enjoyed Purple AI. We -- we're not sharing right now the exact launch date. It will be next year. We're definitely [baiting] this with customers. So stay tuned. We will share more as time progresses. But on the CNAP stuff, we haven't really changed the way we think about it. We always wanted to have and always -- we're always working on broad-based CNAP capabilities that include CSPM as well. And that hasn't changed. I think the only thing that changed is that we're actually a bit more advanced in our road map than we initially expected, and that's a good sign. Once again, we launched data security, which is another part of that CNAP spectrum. And it's a very unique capability. It's an AI-driven approach to detect threats on storage like S3 and even on-prem storage like NetApp. There's nobody else in the market doing that. So all in all, I mean, we're always focusing first on the more differentiated parts of the platform versus going to the commodity. But at some point, I think we'll have the full spectrum of capabilities. And right now, again, given our traction, we're not in a rush to do any of that. It's not like there's any mandatory requirement to have all of these components baked in together as evidenced by our success in the market.OperatorWe are out of time, and I will now pass the call back to the management team for any closing remarks.Tomer WeingartenThank you, everybody. I appreciate your time today, and I want to again congratulate all Sentinels for their performance this quarter.OperatorThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Einhorn's activist targets and their historical performance and go directly to read Long-Term Returns of David Einhorn's 5 Activist Targets. David Einhorn is one of the most successful hedge fund managers. As the co-founder and president of Greenlight Capital, he has made a name for himself by deploying various strategies to squeeze value from the equity markets. The long short value-oriented hedge fund manager was named among the top ten most influential people in the world in 2013.Einhorn has also made a name for himself as one of the most successful activist investors, always ready to go to the extreme ends in the race to unlock shareholder value. Whether calling for board or management changes or pushing for the sale of units or a company, the activist investor is always ready to use his influence and power to optimize shareholders' returns.His aggressive investment strategy was one of the catalysts behind Greenlight Capital's impressive 36.6% return in 2022, outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which plunged 18%. Greenlight Capital has returned over 2,300% for an annualized return of 12.8% net since its inception in 1996, affirming Einhorn's impressive record on Wall Street. Over the same period, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 864% for an annualized return of 8.9%.The activist investor attributes the impressive returns in 2022 to his unwillingness to take risks that most investors jump into as one of the reasons behind the outperformance. In addition, the hedge fund benefited from going short, with short positions returning 30% with an alpha of 15% compared to long positions returning 2.4% with 30.2% alpha.David Einhorn uses the long-short equity strategy, taking long positions in undervalued stocks he believes will explode and short positions in stocks he expects to implode. Some big winners that drove Greenlight Capital to impressive 2022 results include Atlas Air Worldwide, CONSOL Energy, Twitter, and the privately held Siltstone Capital on long positions.Story continuesEinhorn is also best remembered for betting correctly with a short position before the collapse of the Lehman Brothers. Prior to its collapse, Einhorn had embarked on one fierce proxy battle urging the financial institution to explain what he saw as improper markings of collateralized debt obligation.Long-Term Returns of David Einhorn's 10 Activist TargetsDavid Einhorn of Greenlight CapitalEinhorn also made a name for himself thanks to a crusade against Allied Capital in which he opened a short position before it was acquired by Ares Capital Corporation in 2010. The activist investor also lodged a massive campaign against Apple management, insisting that the company needed to do more to return its huge cash haul to investors through dividends or buybacks. The push came after the stock had come under pressure in 2012. You can read our interview with David Einhorn where we talked about his investment approach.The famed short-seller has also faced his fare of challenges and losses on Wall Street. He is believed to have lost a significant amount of money owing to his aggressive campaigns against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as part of a bubble basket of internet stocks between 2017 and 2019.Our MethodologyEinhorn's prolific record on Wall Street speaks for itself, going by the impressive results generated by Greenlight Management over the years. The activist investor has made a good fortune from shorting stocks and pursuing activist campaigns to unlock value in undervalued plays. We have compiled a list of notable companies he invested in and pushed for drastic changes to unlock shareholder value as listed on SEC filings. The stocks are ranked chronologically from when the activist investor engaged the companies.10. Allied CapitalActivist Investment: 2002   Long Term Returns: 73%   S&amp;P 500 Gain: -4%Allied Capital was a company that provided buyout expansion and other forms of debt-equity financing. The company invested in illiquid securities through privately negotiated transactions and financed thousands of companies.Einhorn activist campaign against Allied Capital started in 2002 when he questioned the company's accounting irregularities and corporate governance issues. He believed the stock was overvalued at the time, even as the company was too slow to mark down depressed assets.He went on to term the company a pyramid scheme whereby new investors were used to cover investments consequently. The activist investor took a short position on the stock, believing it would implode due to underlying issues.As part of his proxy battle with the company, he submitted red flags to the Securities and Exchange Commission, expecting the agency to act. What followed was a long public spat between the activist investor and the company, with the latter denying any wrongdoing.Einhorn was vindicated at the height of the financial crisis as Allied Capital came under pressure after one of its key components, Vienna Capital LLC, filed for Bankruptcy. Allied Capital reported more than $1 billion in losses. The stock tanked by more than 97% since Einhorn disclosed his short position, resulting in significant returns.While Allied Capital insisted it suffered because of the financial crisis, Einhorn has always reiterated the losses were self-inflicted.9. Lehman BrothersActivist Investment: 2007   Long Term Returns: 91%   S&amp;P 500 Average Gain: 18.4%Founded in 1847, Lehman Brothers was an American global financial services firm with investment banking equity, fixed income, derivatives sales, and trading operations. In 2007, as the financial crisis was brewing, Einhorn shorted the stock, arguing that the investment banker had massive exposure to illiquid real estate investments that were improperly accounted for.The activist investor also alleged dubious accounting practices in financial fillings as he shared his thesis at the Value Investing Congress. Lehman's weak financial position became apparent in 2008 after Bear Sterns sought a bailout from the Federal Reserve.Its demise started when Lehman's CFO Erin Callan sought to calm the storm by holding a private conference to try and iron out things with Einhorn and his staff, who had opened a short position on the stock. Einhorn and his team's questions about accounting irregularities that Callan failed to address would set off a series of events that resulted in the investment bank going bankrupt in 2008.8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Activist Investment: 2011   Long Term Returns: 40%   S&amp;P 500 Gain: 22%Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology company that designs, develops, and supports software, service devices, and solutions worldwide. It also offers cloud services and operates a gaming division. Einhorn acquired stakes in the company in 2011 and started pushing for the ditching of the then-CEO, Steve Ballmer.The activist investor insisted that after ten years, Ballmer had done all he could do and was not the right person to lead the company forward. He emphasized that his continued presence at the company was the most considerable overhang that prevented shareholders from unlocking optimum value.Einhorn also cited unproductive research and development with Ballmer at the helm, who he believed was stuck in the past, thus allowing the company to lag in online search and social networking areas. The activist investor dumped all his stakes in the company in 2013  after making a single high-digit return that slightly beat the public markets.7. Green Mountain Coffee RoastersActivist Investment: 2011   Long Term Returns: 49%   S&amp;P 500 Average Gain: 18.4%Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was a company that provided single-origin coffee cold brews and a wide range of coffee products. The famed short-seller took a short position on the company in 2011 while questioning its capital expenditure and accounting practices.The activist investor also reiterated that the company faced an uncertain future owing to an unfavorable competitive landscape of increased low-priced competition. Einhorn feared that increased competition in the single-serve coffee market would significantly threaten the company if it did not change its practices. Einhorn reiterated that the company faces significant downside given its high-cost structure.While the short position did generate some returns, it would turn sour in 2015 as the stock exploded on reports that a private investment consortium planned to buy the company at a considerable premium. Before the announcement, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters shares had plunged to $52, presenting a 49% gain on Einhorn's short position.JAB Holdings completed the acquisition for $92 a share or $13.9 billion in 2016. The acquisition price represented a 78% premium.6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Activist Investment: 2013   Long Term Returns: 40%   S&amp;P 500 Average Gain: 142%Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global leader in innovation that creates and sells various devices, such as iPhones, Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, and AirPods. It also operates a cloud computing unit and offers software and services. In 2013, Einhorn was engaged in a fierce proxy battle as he felt the company was not doing enough to return value to shareholders.Consequently, the hedge fund billionaire sued the company, forcing it to return a $137 billion cash pile to shareholders.While owning 1.3 million shares or 0.12% of the company, Einhorn believed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had cash problems and needed to solve it by paying more to investors.The famed shorts seller urged Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders to shoot down Apple's management proposal to eliminate the company's ability to issue preferred stock from its corporate structure. In 2013, Einhorn would drop his lawsuit against the tech giant after it published changes to its corporate charter that included allowing shareholders to vote on the issuance of preferred stock.Click to continue reading and see Long-Term Returns of David Einhorn's 5 Activist Targets.Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Energy Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksMichael Burry’s Top 10 Stock Picks For Q3Michael Burry is Shorting the Market (Again) and Selling These 10 StocksDisclosure: None. Long-Term Returns of David Einhorn's Activist Targets is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the top 10 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USA. On 21st July 2023, seven major tech giants, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pledged a ""voluntary commitment"" to collaborate with the Biden administration to mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Following a meeting with President Joe Biden, these companies agreed to focus on safety, security, and trust in AI development. This included subjecting AI systems to external testing for safety and capabilities, safeguarding against cyber and insider threats, and ensuring that AI does not promote bias or discrimination. How Real is the AI Hype?Whenever a new technology enters the market, investors deliberate its economic implications and its potential to augment corporate profits. The hype around Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has now gained significant momentum which can be realized by the fact that it has contributed to a surge of nearly 40% in the Nasdaq Composite, in the first half of 2023. While some analysts have coined this surge as an ""A.I. gold rush,"" there are contrasting perspectives. Some believe that investors might be preemptively optimistic about the valuation of A.I-related stocks. These cautious perspectives suggest that the anticipated A.I. boom might not unfold as projected, especially concerning stock market investors.However, the analysts at Goldman Sachs present a differing view, contending that the hype about A.I. is indeed real. Kash Rangan, a software analyst at the bank, conveyed his viewpoint through an interview featured in Goldman's latest publication, ""Top of Mind."" Rangan stated, ""A.I likely isn't undergoing a period of unwarranted exaggeration. When there's a unanimous consensus within the technology provider community that a genuine technological shift is taking place, it signifies an actual transformation. Furthermore, when customer interest starts to escalate, such enthusiasm shouldn't be dismissed as mere hype. The growing interest from customers solidifies the authenticity of the trend."" To read more about the disruptions by AI, check out our article on Industries Being Revolutionized by AI.Story continuesHow Important is Artificial Intelligence for Corporations?While the threat of AI replacing humans for employment opportunities remains huge, there is not denying that the same AI has tremendous potential to boost the productivity and efficiency of corporations. In fact, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, Ben Snider, projects a 1.5% annual productivity growth over the next decade through A.I which can potentially lead to a 30% or higher boost in S&amp;P 500 profits. To read about how AI can replace human jobs, check out our article about Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.To exemplify, we can look at how NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has risen as a leader in AI by spearheading the development of specialized GPUs optimized for intricate AI computations. These GPUs, built with powerful parallel processing capabilities, are exceptionally well-suited for AI tasks. With a 95% market share in the GPU sector, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominance has become more than evident, as it empowers a number of AI applications with outstanding performance and efficiency. Mairs &amp; Power, an investment advisor, released “Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund” that commented in second quarter investor letter:“Regarding stock selection in the first half, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a massive outperformer, up 189.54%. Amazon and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year. Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) computation for both learning and inferencing, and its stock rallied significantly on a massive earnings report in the first quarter as cloud data center companies invested heavily in AI.”In fact, in Q2 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue leaped to $13.5 billion, a twofold YoY increase, driving its stock up 220% since the year's start, with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. The company's specialized AI chips underscore its advantage, and thus, dominate 80% of the global market.Moreover, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s H100 chip which is vital for AI commands double its initial price due to high demand. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering a transformative trend with its groundbreaking ""Algorithm of Thoughts"" (AoT) which signifies a substantial leap forward in AI training. By combining human cognition and algorithmic logic, AoT aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This innovative approach, guided by in-context learning, streamlines problem-solving pathways which would result in faster and less resource-intensive outcomes. With AoT, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) envisions a more organized and systematic exploration of solutions, potentially surpassing the performance of the algorithms themselves. This marks a pertinent shift from traditional supervised learning methods to an integrated search process. As Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) drives this paradigm shift, it underscores their commitment to shaping the future of AI through innovative techniques that can revolutionize problem-solving across industries.List of 55 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USAPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashMethodologyTo prepare the list of artificial intelligence companies in USA, we conducted an extensive research to find out the companies that have been highly active and innovative in the US with their AI applications.

If you want to skip our introduction to different metrics of stock trading, then head on over to 5 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy Today. One way in which technology has impacted the financial world is the ability to monitor trends in share movements. Investing in the market can be done through multiple approaches. One of these involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine current performance and future prospects. The other involves analyzing market trends and seeing which stocks are currently generating interest. Interest in a stock on the stock market can be either negative or positive, and some indicators that can be used to gauge investor sentiment are the relative strength index (RSI), short interest, and volume of shares traded.The relative strength index is a mathematical computation that analyzes whether shares of a firm are overbought or oversold. It is also used to determine whether the share price is about to reverse a trend, with the chart's inability to either cross or meet previous highs or lows thought to be bearish or bullish indicators. For more details about oversold and overbought stocks, you can check out 10 Oversold Growth Stocks To Buy.The short interest in a stock is the number of shares that have been sold short on the market. Short selling, for the uninitiated, attempts to profit from negative share price movement by rooting out inconsistencies in management or the overall business model. Short sellers either buy options that enable them to sell shares at high prices or directly sell the stock on the market after borrowing it. To see which stocks are currently on the short seller radar and a detailed explanation of what short selling is, you might be interested in 16 Most Shorted Stocks Right Now.Finally, a rather simple metric to see what's happening in the market right now is the volume of shares traded. Rather self explanatory in nature, this just takes a look at the shares that are changing hands right now. Unlike the previous two indicators, however, it can not help in gauging the sentiment behind these transactions. So, the volume of shares traded has to be combined with other indicators, such as the share price gain or loss and moving averages for several time periods to understand the underlying reasons behind market events. Additionally, the volume itself is often measured and compared by dividing the current volume with multiple month averages to truly determine whether anything unusual is happening around a stock.Story continuesThis is because the singular reading of a stock's volume is based on its liquidity and shares floating on the market. These factors are often crucial determinants of returns and pricing as well since stocks with low liquidity (or low demand or supply of the shares) can often lead to 'flash crashes' as the price rapidly deteriorates. Finally, the volume of a stock is also influenced by its popularity as large and mega cap stocks often have more liquidity and greater volume while other, smaller firms can lag in this area. Of course, volume is not limited to stocks only, and instead, it measures sentiment surrounding any security that is being traded on a market, whether it's a stock, an exchange traded fund (ETF), or a currency. We recently took a look at 20 Biggest ETFs by Volume and found that the top three were ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (NASDAQ:SQQQ), ProShares UltraPro QQQ (NASDAQ:TQQQ), and SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).But what about stocks?

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence market, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Artificial intelligence has been all the hype so far in 2023. Every notable tech company is trying to roll out advanced artificial intelligence products and services, while every consumer and investor is obsessively following AI-related news to keep apprised of how this technology develops and evolves even further. With rising interest in this technology, companies investing in this space are trying to make the most out of the artificial intelligence craze, as recent moves by several big tech names have shown.Competition In The AI SpaceAn example of one such company is that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The tech giant has recently announced that it is now going to be offering the company's Duet AI, a technology that is introducing generative AI applications to the Google suite of products, generally in Google Workspace. It is charging large businesses about $30 per month for each user making use of its artificial intelligence enhancements, which are being added to Gmail and other Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) productivity apps. The technology is being offered with a free trial before the paid subscription begins, allowing users to get a feel of what they can accomplish on their Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) applications with this technology incorporated in them. According to the company's announcement, a consumer version of Duet AI is expected to be made available in Google Workspace early in 2024, leaving those who are following the news closely in anticipation of the transformations they can expect from this tech.Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Duet AI is set to rival its competitor Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 Copilot enhancements in both pricing and user experience. The rivalry between the two big tech companies really goes to show how neither wants to be left in the dust by the other, leading both to continue working on and investing in AI-related products and services to make them readily available to their respective consumers. While companies are busy competing with each other over besting the other in the AI race, investors are in a panic over how to invest in this space to make the most of the AI boom we have been seeing. Considering this, here are some comments from CNBC's Financial Advisor Council member, Barry Glassman, about artificial intelligence, made this August:Story continues""AI has the potential to transform every company and how we go about the world. I believe AI is going to be as transformative as the internet itself. There's going to be distruptions just like the internet, there are going to sectors, industries, companies that fail because AI is just too easy and cheap. But at the same time, the overall productivity of the US and global economy, I think is going to take leaps and leaps so that we get so much more done and so many more innovations that the economy as a whole will benefit.""Niche Players Or Outliers?On the subject of how to invest in AI, Glassman said the following:""The niche players early on may not, in fact, be the long-term plays. For example, the early internet investments like AOL and Cisco were phenomenal in the first few years - they weren't the major players over the next 10 or 20. The same was true during the pandemic stocks... Even the non-AI companies, even the non-technology companies, they're going to benefit so much from this technology that I'm not sure it makes sense to just invest in the niche players in today's market.""Investors can thus benefit from taking a broader view of the market to find outliers that have the potential to benefit from AI alongside companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) that are right in the middle of the AI boom. Considering the above, we have gone through Goldman Sachs' AI stock picks to give investors an idea of what sort of companies institutional investors are leaning toward in this space today. These include top AI stock picks for the long term alongside many cheap AI stocks.Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksCopyright: kentoh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' second-quarter 13F holdings to pick 10 AI stocks based on the investor's stakes in them.

Demand was weaker in all markets except auto. While revenue was down 11% due to the slowing economy, we believe the outlook is positive.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers How Quickly Is Signet Jewelers Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes.

Signet Jewelers CEO Gina Drosos joins Yahoo Finance Live to explain consumer spending patterns the diamond retailer is noticing.""Over the last couple of months, we have seen some modest increases in traffic and we've seen some resurgence in low-priced fashion,"" Drosos says. ""That's actually a good sign... as women are going back to work, kind of a back-to-school feeling. that typically bodes well as we go into holiday.""Drosos also notes the new ways customers are shopping for and researching jewelry online, stating ""close to 80 percent of customers start their shopping journey online.""Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: Joining us now is Gina Drosos, Signet Jewelers CEO. Gina, pretty solid quarter here and you guys are looking ahead to an even stronger engagement ring season. I'm curious, though, what changes, if any, you're seeing on the consumer side when it comes to the purchase of those engagement rings? With lab-grown diamonds becoming more and more popular, a lot of consumers looking to that as an affordable option, are you seeing consumers trade down to that or perhaps smaller carat sizes?GINA DROSOS: Well, we've seen a number of things on the consumer front. We think the customer stays cautious through the holiday season. Over the last couple of months, though, we have seen some modest increases in traffic. And we've seen some resurgence in low-priced fashion. That's actually a good sign. That self-purchase as women are going back to work, kind of a back to school feeling. That typically bodes well as we go into holiday.And then in terms of engagement, we're really in a one year low in 2023. This is the trough of what happened three years ago, 3 and 1/2 years ago, which is that COVID disrupting dating. And so we're seeing less engagements this year by about 25% versus normal. That trough happens in the third quarter. And we expect it to begin to come back a bit in the fourth quarter.Story continuesLab created is more a part of customers purchases now. It's actually a very nice innovation for a more value-conscious customer. But we're not seeing trade down. For Signet, we actually see a higher average transaction value and a higher margin on lab created versus natural.AKIKO FUJITA: You mentioned the rebound that you're seeing in lower price points. I wonder how that sort of sets things up for how you think about pricing right now. I mean, does it lead to additional discounts? Or is it really about meeting the consumer where they are in terms of the products you offer?GINA DROSOS: We're really answering that through our assortment right now. We have a great breadth of assortment across our different banners. We have banter that typically plays in a lower price range. We've tiered up our Jared business significantly. So we're carrying quite stylish high-quality pieces in that banner with Kay and Zales in between. We also now have diamonds direct Blue Nile James Allen in our portfolio.And while those three businesses skew more toward engagement and bridal, they also have very nice fashion assortments. So our assortment is broad. We will use strategic promotion to drive traffic to get customers into the store. In a macro environment like this, they're often waiting to get the best value. But we'll be able to bring them that great value throughout the season.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You mentioned getting customers back into the stores. In terms of digital versus brick-and-mortar, are you seeing a clear preference among the consumer? And with that brick-and-mortar, do you anticipate needing to close more stores down the line?GINA DROSOS: So we've seen a big shift in how customers shop for jewelry over the last several years that we think is a permanent shift. So now, we see close to 80% of customers start their shopping journey online. They're researching. They're going to different websites. They're becoming educated about styles and also about different carat weights or different colors of gold, that kind of thing.And then we see them come into the store for the kind of expert consultation that a company like Signet is great at providing. We really believe that our jewelry consultants are a competitive advantage and build-- they have great expertise. And so they build a great trust relationship. So while almost 80% of customers start the journey in store, only 20% of them-- i mean, start it online, only 20% transact online. Most are transacting in the store.AKIKO FUJITA: So what does that mean for your brick-and-mortar footprint? I mean, earlier this year you announced 150 store closures, is there more to come? Or are you pretty comfortable with the number you have right now?GINA DROSOS: You know, we are always looking at the opportunity to optimize our store footprint. We'll be closing out of that 150 mostly low-performing mall locations in both the US and the UK. We also announced that we were opening about 30 or 35 new doors. Most of those are large footprint doors, like a diamond direct or a Jared. So actually, our square-footage stays about the same. But we believe that we're better positioning the stores.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Gina Drosos, Signet CEO, thanks so much for your time.GINA DROSOS: Oh, thank you.]"

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Valuable Brands In The World In 2023. In 2023, the global business landscape continues to evolve, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and dynamic market forces. The world's most valuable brands like Amazon, Apple, and Walmart among others are at the forefront of this ever-changing landscape, whose influence extends far beyond their products and services. These brands represent the pinnacle of success, embodying innovation, trust, and a deep understanding of their customers. As we delve into the year's rankings, we discover not only the names that have retained their coveted positions but also those newcomers that have surged ahead, reshaping industries and setting new standards for excellence. Regional and Industry Trends in Brand Valuation In recent years, exciting changes have emerged in brand valuation. One outstanding trend is the growing importance of brand value in emerging markets, particularly in Asia. As these economies expand and become more consumer-focused, brands that build strong customer relationships are well-positioned for success. Regarding specific industries, technology, and retail dominate the brand valuation landscape. However, there's also a noticeable shift towards sustainability and social responsibility, with brands prioritizing these values and seeing increased recognition and value. This shift is especially evident in the fashion industry, where consumers are becoming more conscious of their purchases' environmental and ethical impact. In terms of financial statistics, recent data shows that the total value of the world's top 100 brands reached $7 trillion in 2021, marking a 44% increase from the previous year. The world's top 10 most valuable brands are predominantly technology companies, with Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft claiming the top three spots. Nevertheless, several fashion and consumer goods brands, such as Nike and Louis Vuitton, have also secured marks on the list, underscoring the significance of brand value across various industries. Story continuesTechnology Dominance: Tech Companies Among the Top Brands It's hard to deny technology's significant impact on our daily lives. We rely heavily on devices like smartphones and laptops to stay connected, informed, and entertained. It's no wonder, then, that tech companies are among the top brands in the world. For instance, Apple's innovative products and sleek designs consistently rank it as one of the most valuable brands globally.  According to Forbes, Apple's brand is worth $241.2 billion. Similarly, Google's search engine and online tools have become synonymous with the internet. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is worth over $1 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies globally. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become household names, with billions of active users worldwide.  Facebook's revenue for 2022 was $116.6 billion, while Instagram's revenue is expected to reach $50 billion by 2023. But it's not just the big players dominating the tech industry. Startups and smaller companies are also making waves, disrupting traditional industries and improving our lives in new ways. Fintech companies like Robinhood and Chime are changing how we invest and manage our money, while healthcare startups like Babylon Health and Heal use technology to improve access to healthcare services. Future Outlook for Brand Valuation in 2023 In 2023, the continued rise of social media is expected to shape brand valuation. This trend will lead to a greater need to measure the impact of social media on brand value as more and more companies invest in their online presence. Advancements in data analytics and artificial intelligence will make it easier to collect and analyze data on consumer behaviour and brand sentiment, resulting in more accurate and reliable brand valuation.  In addition, the growing importance of sustainability and corporate social responsibility will likely impact brand valuation. As consumers become more conscious of the impact of their purchases on the environment and society, companies that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices will see an increase in brand value. This shift in consumer behavior will require companies to focus on financial performance and their societal impact, which will be reflected in their brand valuation. 25 Most Valuable Brands In The World 2023Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Our Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the most valuable brands in the world in 2023 based on their brand values as of 2023.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the top 10 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USA. On 21st July 2023, seven major tech giants, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pledged a ""voluntary commitment"" to collaborate with the Biden administration to mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Following a meeting with President Joe Biden, these companies agreed to focus on safety, security, and trust in AI development. This included subjecting AI systems to external testing for safety and capabilities, safeguarding against cyber and insider threats, and ensuring that AI does not promote bias or discrimination. How Real is the AI Hype?Whenever a new technology enters the market, investors deliberate its economic implications and its potential to augment corporate profits. The hype around Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has now gained significant momentum which can be realized by the fact that it has contributed to a surge of nearly 40% in the Nasdaq Composite, in the first half of 2023. While some analysts have coined this surge as an ""A.I. gold rush,"" there are contrasting perspectives. Some believe that investors might be preemptively optimistic about the valuation of A.I-related stocks. These cautious perspectives suggest that the anticipated A.I. boom might not unfold as projected, especially concerning stock market investors.However, the analysts at Goldman Sachs present a differing view, contending that the hype about A.I. is indeed real. Kash Rangan, a software analyst at the bank, conveyed his viewpoint through an interview featured in Goldman's latest publication, ""Top of Mind."" Rangan stated, ""A.I likely isn't undergoing a period of unwarranted exaggeration. When there's a unanimous consensus within the technology provider community that a genuine technological shift is taking place, it signifies an actual transformation. Furthermore, when customer interest starts to escalate, such enthusiasm shouldn't be dismissed as mere hype. The growing interest from customers solidifies the authenticity of the trend.""

In fact, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, Ben Snider, projects a 1.5% annual productivity growth over the next decade through A.I which can potentially lead to a 30% or higher boost in S&amp;P 500 profits. To read about how AI can replace human jobs, check out our article about Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.To exemplify, we can look at how NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has risen as a leader in AI by spearheading the development of specialized GPUs optimized for intricate AI computations. These GPUs, built with powerful parallel processing capabilities, are exceptionally well-suited for AI tasks. With a 95% market share in the GPU sector, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominance has become more than evident, as it empowers a number of AI applications with outstanding performance and efficiency. Mairs &amp; Power, an investment advisor, released “Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund” that commented in second quarter investor letter:“Regarding stock selection in the first half, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a massive outperformer, up 189.54%. Amazon and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year. Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) computation for both learning and inferencing, and its stock rallied significantly on a massive earnings report in the first quarter as cloud data center companies invested heavily in AI.”In fact, in Q2 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue leaped to $13.5 billion, a twofold YoY increase, driving its stock up 220% since the year's start, with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. The company's specialized AI chips underscore its advantage, and thus, dominate 80% of the global market.Moreover, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s H100 chip which is vital for AI commands double its initial price due to high demand. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering a transformative trend with its groundbreaking ""Algorithm of Thoughts"" (AoT) which signifies a substantial leap forward in AI training. By combining human cognition and algorithmic logic, AoT aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This innovative approach, guided by in-context learning, streamlines problem-solving pathways which would result in faster and less resource-intensive outcomes. With AoT, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) envisions a more organized and systematic exploration of solutions, potentially surpassing the performance of the algorithms themselves. This marks a pertinent shift from traditional supervised learning methods to an integrated search process. As Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) drives this paradigm shift, it underscores their commitment to shaping the future of AI through innovative techniques that can revolutionize problem-solving across industries.List of 55 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USAPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashMethodologyTo prepare the list of artificial intelligence companies in USA, we conducted an extensive research to find out the companies that have been highly active and innovative in the US with their AI applications.

CBS News Travel Editor Peter Greenberg reviews the travel conditions that could cause delays for major airline operators.""Three of the four major air traffic control centers are below their 85% staffing threshold,"" Greenberg says. ""That means even in the best of weather, they have to slow things down because they literally do not have enough controllers to work the number of flights the airline scheduled.""Greenberg comments on the price trends for international travel bookings as compared to domestic travel prices.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]AKIKO FUJITA: With Labor Day weekend fast approaching, millions of Americans are going to the skies and the roads. According to AAA, domestic bookings are up 4% and international bookings are up 44%. But after a rough start to the summer travel season, we have a look at whether travelers may be in for a similar fate.Joining us now is CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg. Peter, we've got the FAA predicting this is going to be the third busiest holiday weekend. How smooth are things going to look?PETER GREENBERG: Well, you know what? Whether or not withstanding, demand is actually starting to decrease. People are starting to stay home a little more because they couldn't afford the airfares. They couldn't afford the hotel rates. So you're seeing airfares right now down about 11% from where they were about two weeks ago. And that's a good sign leading into the fall.Now having said that, this is the last big hurrah weekend for the year leading into Thanksgiving. So people will be on the road. They will be taking to the skies. It's the usual chaos because all year long, it's not really seasonal. Flights have been full. Airports have been crowded and sometimes overcrowded.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And for many consumers, the southwest meltdown that we saw in December, still top of mind. We also had multiple delays this summer amid pilot and other labor shortages. What does that mean for this weekend and looking beyond into the back half of the year when it comes to some of those potential disruptions?Story continuesPETER GREENBERG: Well, beyond pilot shortages and computer meltdowns, you've got a lingering problem with the FAA. Three of the four major air traffic control centers are below their 85% staffing threshold, which means even in the best of weather, they have to slow things down because they literally do not have enough controllers to work the number of flights the airlines have scheduled.So you can expect delays just on that alone, then you throw weather in. So let's just hope there's not any weather. It'll just be slow.AKIKO FUJITA: Now, Peter, you mentioned that we're already starting to see some consumers pull back from their travel plans this time of year. What does that suggest in terms of how things are going to look come holiday season? That is another big driver for so many of these airlines.PETER GREENBERG: It is. But we have to go back to the COVID days, where so many of us came up close and personal with our own sense of personal mortality and made a decision that we were going to forego expensive material goods and new cars and clothing and jewelry. We wanted to focus on buying experiences.So all that money that was saved up during COVID was spent on that. Here's the problem. We've blown through those savings and now we're putting it on our credit cards, as you've already reported numerous times, I suspect. Consumer credit debt on credit cards is over $1 trillion.So part of that weakening and demand is because people are getting their credit card bills at 24% interest and trying to reassess what their priorities really are.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And amid a lot of those higher prices is there anything the consumer can do to try and score better deals?PETER GREENBERG: Yes, the good news is, as demand is falling, we're now starting to see drastic reductions in international affairs. Just about a month ago, a round trip ticket from New York to London in Coach was about $2,200. That's crazy. Today, I'm seeing fares starting now, not just waiting for Labor Day, down to $208 each way. And that includes taxes and fees. That's a remarkable change.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Peter, you know, we've heard so much from these airlines about the strength they're seeing in international travel versus domestic. What are you seeing going into this weekend? Where are travelers going?PETER GREENBERG: Well, most of them are not going internationally. They're coming back from their foreign vacations. Most of them are staying home close to home because of school seasons and having to start the season after Labor Day. But if you want to be a smart traveler, now's the time book international flights. As I said, that $208 example I gave you is just one of them.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. I'll have to get some notes there on where to travel internationally. CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

105,73ed66ca-bcf6-3aa2-a60d-65d3b99a04db,TDG,2023-09-01,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why TransDigm Group (TDG) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004097.html,1693497604,STORY,['TDG'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at TransDigm Group (TDG), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. TransDigm Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for TDG that show why this aircraft components maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor TDG, shares are up 0.89% over the past week while the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry is up 0.76% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.73% compares favorably with the industry's 0.44% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of TransDigm Group have risen 12.04%, and are up 50.36% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.77% and 14.97%, respectively.Investors should also take note of TDG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, TDG is averaging 247,753 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with TDG.Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost TDG's consensus estimate, increasing from $24.03 to $25.31 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that TDG is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep TransDigm Group on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(HWKN) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hawkins-inc-hwkn-hit-52-131507068.html,1693487707,STORY,"['HWKN', 'PPG']","[Shares of Hawkins (HWKN) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 34.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $62.02 in the previous session. Hawkins has gained 60.7% since the start of the year compared to the 6.2% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 11.3% return for the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 2, 2023, Hawkins reported EPS of $1.12 versus consensus estimate of $0.61.For the current fiscal year, Hawkins is expected to post earnings of $3.40 per share on $940.24 million in revenues. This represents a 18.88% change in EPS on a 0.55% change in revenues.Valuation MetricsHawkins may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Hawkins has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 15X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.9X versus its peer group's average of 9.8X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Hawkins currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Hawkins fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Hawkins shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does HWKN Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of HWKN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG). PPG has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. PPG Industries, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 5.14%, and for the current fiscal year, PPG is expected to post earnings of $7.51 per share on revenue of $18.23 billion.Shares of PPG Industries, Inc. have gained 0.2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 18.92X and a P/CF of 16.78X.The Chemical - Specialty industry may rank in the bottom 78% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for HWKN and PPG, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It remains focused on driving growth though innovation and new product development. Its innovation-driven investment is focused on several high-growth areas. DD remains committed to drive returns from its R&amp;D investment.The company recently completed the buyout of leading manufacturer of specialty medical devices and components, Spectrum Plastics Group from AEA Investors for $1.75 billion. The acquired business, with annual sales of around $500 million, has been integrated into the industrial solutions line of business within the Electronics &amp; Industrial segment.The acquisition strengthens DuPont’s existing position in stable and fast-growing healthcare end-markets. It is also in sync with its focus on high-growth, customer-driven innovation for the healthcare market. The addition of Spectrum is expected to boost revenues in the Electronics &amp; Industrial segment in the third quarter.DuPont is also benefiting from cost synergy savings and productivity improvement actions. Its structural cost actions are contributing to its bottom line. It also continues to implement strategic price increases in the wake of raw material and energy cost inflation. These actions are likely to support its results in 2023. The company is also managing its portfolio with an aim for value creation. It is divesting non-core assets to focus more on high-growth, high-margin businesses.However, the company’s water business faces challenges from the slowdown in China. Its water solutions business is expected to see sales moderation in the second half of 2023 due to softer demand in China resulting from the slowdown in the industrial economy.Story continuesThe softness in construction end-markets is also expected to impact the shelter solutions business within the Water &amp; Protection segment in 2023. Also, customer de-stocking in shelter solutions is expected to continue through the third quarter.While the company is seeing a recovery in Interconnect Solutions, the business is expected to continue to be impacted by reduced consumer electronics spending in the near term. Interconnect Solutions saw a 15% volume decline in the second quarter due to softer smartphone, personal computing and tablet demand. DuPont’s move to adjust production rates is also expected to impact its top line and margins. The company is taking actions to reduce production rates in electronics to align inventory with demand.

Chemours sees weaker demand in advanced materials in second-half 2023.While destocking in China and Europe has largely ended, the pace of demand recovery is expected to be modest over the near term, given the weak global economic recovery and continued macroeconomic uncertainties.

110,e5f4c288-5e6f-3551-9d45-6d86672ec1c3,GS,2023-09-01,Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-growth-stocks-top-030336914.html,1693537416,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'INTU', 'AMT', 'MRK', 'ZS', 'MA', 'SPLK', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Goldman Sachs' top 12 growth stock picks. If you want to skip the latest about one of America's most well known banks, then head on over to Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is making a lot of headlines these days, and not all of these are good. There's turmoil brewing within its walls and its chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon has continued to come under fire from a lot of quarters. 2022 wasn't kind to Goldman, as its revenue and net income dropped annually in the wake of the Federal Reserve's historic interest rate hikes. The bank's revenue for the 12 months ending in December last year stood at $47 billion and marked a sizeable drop of $12 billion. Similarly, its net income also dropped by $10 billion. This necessitated the bank to make some hard changes, one of which was reducing employee compensation.As you'd likely know if you've been reading Insider Monkey regularly, last year wasn't great for anyone who isn't a multi millionaire or a billionaire. Inflation touched a record high and right during this time, Goldman Sachs' employees also saw their compensation go down - a decision that didn't win Mr. Solomon any fans. At the center of this turmoil is the bank's much hyped Marcus division, which would provide loans to consumers and accept deposits. Goldman's reputation on Wall Street helped with the product launch and the bank soon attracted billions of dollars in deposits. It slowly expanded Marcus to include investment management and advising services. However, this is where the bank made mistakes, as it relied too much on its experience with high net worth individuals to develop profitability models for the Marcus investment division.Another mistake during this time period was Goldman's acquisition of GreenSky, a buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform. GreenSky is reported to be making hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, adding further to Mr. Solomon's woes. Seems like the Goldman boss really can't do anything right as far as sentiment in some quarters is concerned, with layoffs, Marcus, and GreenSky all heating up the pot against him.Story continuesBut wait, there's more. A big announcement that was also part of Goldman's push into the consumer world is its partnership with the Cupertino, California consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The pair partnered up in 2019 to provide the Apple Card platform, which allowed Apple customers to open savings accounts and conduct other financial actions. However, Goldman has lost billions of dollars from Apple Card, and most of these are believed to come from consumer disputes that have proven to be a bit too much for the investment bank to handle. With Apple Card's losses believed to sit at $5 billion as of late 2023, Mr. Solomon extended the partnership with Apple until 2029 in October 2022, so perhaps some of the ire directed at him does make some sense.Being on the back foot isn't great, and with August coming to an end, Goldman announced that it is selling its Personal Finance Management (PFM) business division. PFM was a wealth management unit that managed millionaires' money and Goldman's shares gained a couple of dollars on the market when the sale was announced. Year to date though the stock is down 5.35% and represents a cyclical roller coaster track that shows an inherent conflict in investors' minds when it comes to betting about the bank's future.Thought the bank's troubles were over? Think again as the Financial Times reports that the Federal Reserve has warned Goldman about its business dealings with financial technology and payments firms such as Stripe and Wise.However, even though it might very well be the case that someone has hexed Goldman Sachs, the fact still remains that its research division is one of the most credible in the world. An analyst's true test comes when he or she stands against the tide, and Goldman has been one of the very, very few in the industry that has been skeptical of a deep recession in the U.S. So, its stock picks still merit a deeper look and today we'll analyze some growth stocks. As a primer, growth stocks are those whose share price diverges significantly from the earnings per share, and if you're wondering why that is, check out 10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence market, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Artificial intelligence has been all the hype so far in 2023. Every notable tech company is trying to roll out advanced artificial intelligence products and services, while every consumer and investor is obsessively following AI-related news to keep apprised of how this technology develops and evolves even further. With rising interest in this technology, companies investing in this space are trying to make the most out of the artificial intelligence craze, as recent moves by several big tech names have shown.Competition In The AI SpaceAn example of one such company is that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The tech giant has recently announced that it is now going to be offering the company's Duet AI, a technology that is introducing generative AI applications to the Google suite of products, generally in Google Workspace. It is charging large businesses about $30 per month for each user making use of its artificial intelligence enhancements, which are being added to Gmail and other Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) productivity apps. The technology is being offered with a free trial before the paid subscription begins, allowing users to get a feel of what they can accomplish on their Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) applications with this technology incorporated in them. According to the company's announcement, a consumer version of Duet AI is expected to be made available in Google Workspace early in 2024, leaving those who are following the news closely in anticipation of the transformations they can expect from this tech.Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Duet AI is set to rival its competitor Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 Copilot enhancements in both pricing and user experience. The rivalry between the two big tech companies really goes to show how neither wants to be left in the dust by the other, leading both to continue working on and investing in AI-related products and services to make them readily available to their respective consumers. While companies are busy competing with each other over besting the other in the AI race, investors are in a panic over how to invest in this space to make the most of the AI boom we have been seeing. Considering this, here are some comments from CNBC's Financial Advisor Council member, Barry Glassman, about artificial intelligence, made this August:Story continues""AI has the potential to transform every company and how we go about the world. I believe AI is going to be as transformative as the internet itself. There's going to be distruptions just like the internet, there are going to sectors, industries, companies that fail because AI is just too easy and cheap. But at the same time, the overall productivity of the US and global economy, I think is going to take leaps and leaps so that we get so much more done and so many more innovations that the economy as a whole will benefit.""Niche Players Or Outliers?On the subject of how to invest in AI, Glassman said the following:""The niche players early on may not, in fact, be the long-term plays. For example, the early internet investments like AOL and Cisco were phenomenal in the first few years - they weren't the major players over the next 10 or 20. The same was true during the pandemic stocks... Even the non-AI companies, even the non-technology companies, they're going to benefit so much from this technology that I'm not sure it makes sense to just invest in the niche players in today's market.""Investors can thus benefit from taking a broader view of the market to find outliers that have the potential to benefit from AI alongside companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) that are right in the middle of the AI boom. Considering the above, we have gone through Goldman Sachs' AI stock picks to give investors an idea of what sort of companies institutional investors are leaning toward in this space today. These include top AI stock picks for the long term alongside many cheap AI stocks.Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksCopyright: kentoh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' second-quarter 13F holdings to pick 10 AI stocks based on the investor's stakes in them.

The Purosangue is designed not as a copycat sports utility vehicle that many other luxury automakers sell, but as a true Ferrari car that their devoted fan base can use for more practical transportation needs. Since the average Ferrari is only driven a few thousand miles a year or less, they are best understood as mechanical works of art rather than a means of transportation. But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Best Mining Penny Stocks to Buy Now20 Biggest ETFs by Volume10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts Disclosure: None.

The three-day event kicks off Tuesday, September 5. So what can we expect to hear from the industry leaders?Joining us now, we want to bring in Kash Rangan, a software equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. It's great to see you here, Kasho. So let's talk about the big theme. I have a feeling, I know what one of them is going to be, but what do you expect here?Story continuesKASH RANGAN: Guess what-- what you were expecting I'm expecting as well, and that's two letters-- AI.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.KASH RANGAN: Listen, I think this conference is going to be absolutely amazing. We got a terrific lineup. It's going to be three days. We're going to have-- I forget-- what 700-- more than 700 representatives from tech, media, telecom companies present.I think the key thing everybody is looking for, at least what I'm looking for, what I'm telling clients what to look for is what kind of uptake we're going to see with generative AI when it goes to calendar '24. We've seen a slew of launches from the likes of Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Adobe, and the list goes on.Practically every technology company has an AI offering. And they hope to get more customer wallet share in return for all their productivity.So when is that going to start to really manifest in revenue is one question. Number two, what's happening with macro. I mean, last year at same point in time, we were headed into this inflation spiral stasis and decision making, and company growth rates start to really decelerate as you start to look at the leading indicators.Now, we're at a point where things are stabilizing, right? So the second big question is, what is your macro outlook? What is the pulse of the spending environment? What the budgets for calendar '24 look like? And third is, when are you going to start to hire? There's no growth in the software industry unless you really hire. It's a very headcount-intensive industry.So we've been going through layoffs and freezes in hiring. And when is that going to start to turn around? When do you see the demand signals green shoots that will prompt you to hire? Hiring comes back, growth is going to come back next year. So those are the three big things.BRAD SMITH: Kash, from your perspective, what company needs to have an MVP-like performance at Communacopia in order to save investors' attention or at least some fanfare or perhaps reinvigorated around their company as we go into the fourth quarter of this year?KASH RANGAN: Minimum viable product or most valuable player, which one?BRAD SMITH: Most valuable player.KASH RANGAN: OK. Because I'm in the tech industry, MVP is a slightly different. Yeah.I think if you look at the two leading tech companies that at least from investor's perspective have been leading the charge for generative AI, it's Nvidia and Microsoft. And both companies are going to be presenting.And I think we're going to have-- very fortunate to have CFO of Microsoft Amy Hood. She doesn't present at much conferences, very fortunate to have her. We're going to discuss pricing power of the copilot. Every company is launching a copilot. We're going to have more copilot than pilots, but that's OK. It's all meant to boost productivity.So I think they are the first ones off the gate in software land with what we would call in the tech industry minimum viable product, as you would call it, a most valuable player. So I think Microsoft is the number one on that list with a very interesting product right off the gate.And I would not rule out Adobe. The CEO of Adobe rarely presents at conferences. And he's going to be with us. He's going to talk about the generative AI products that can be infused into the core creative family, Firefly, a whole bunch of things, Salesforce. Number four on that list would be ServiceNow. I think we're going to hear a lot of most valuable player type-- most valuable product type insertions in the mix.SEANA SMITH: Kash, I think there's a lot of investors out there trying to figure out whether all this hype, whether all this excitement over AI, if it's a bit overdone, given where the technology is and how companies are using it. Do you think there is a case for that at all at this stage?KASH RANGAN: I think the timing of when all this term comes to fruition was probably a little aggressive in our minds, investors' minds. I'll take some of the blame as well. And so we're going to start to see this manifest. Let's take Microsoft. Copilot was announced-- it was priced at $30 per user per month, much higher than what the market thought. And it's not-- it's not yet made generally available. Now, the expectation is that it's going to start to manifest in revenue in June quarter of 2024. So that's a good nine months away.I think there was an expectation that given how magical this technology is, you put it out and people start using it. It starts to have immediate impact on revenue. That's what investors want. But unfortunately, that's not going to be the case. It's going to take another six to nine months. I think the timing is the key disappointment versus people's expectations.But I think as far as what the technology itself can do, oddly the more time we give it to start to come to fruition, the more effective it's likely going to be.BRAD SMITH: What is the acceptability in terms of time range, where investors need to see some type of flow through to margins as a result of generative AI announcements and then investments, to which we still don't know definitive figures for some of these companies and how much they're putting towards these initiatives?KASH RANGAN: Yeah. Yeah. I think there's two phases one is learning, and then the other is inference to use a technical term. Learning is very capital intensive. So you need the likes of Nvidia, GPUs, Microsoft, Hyperscaler, Google. Let's not count Google out right. They're all in the mix.So this learning process is going to be very capital intensive. It's very data intensive, compute intensive. Then after we're done with all the learning, then we put the learning to work. And that's the inference phase. So the inference phase is high-margin stuff, right? That's when all the pricing power that we all want software companies to exercise and go out and have an Adobe charge for the new creative Firefly, or Salesforce charge more for the new products, that ChatGPT-oriented family, and ServiceNow with the Pro Plus and Microsoft Copilot. All that happens in the inference phase.So that's when the incremental cost for that incremental uptake we're going to get is still going to be very de minimis. That's when the margins really start to come to fruition. But right now, we've got to accept the fact that this is very capital intensive. We've got to take that hit on margins in return for the inference and the pricing and the big margin lift we could see in calendar '24. Does that make sense?SEANA SMITH: That does make a heck of a lot of sense. And then this also brings me to the question I want to ask you just about the first mover advantage and how much of a benefit some of these names like Nvidia, like you were talking about before, Microsoft, even Google on that list. Yes, they have invested a lot into AI up until this point. And yes, they have a very wide lead. But how worried or I guess, how quickly do you see some of their rivals potentially catching up to them?KASH RANGAN: I think in this degenerative game, there's going to be a few large language models and many not so large language models that are going to be domain-specific, sort of like application software. You have the big ERP companies, like SAP, Oracle. Then you have the vertical specific companies that are very in charge of their domains, whether it's health care or financial services. They own that vertical. And they're really, really good at it. But they cannot solve all of world's problems.In a similar way, what you're going to see is that the big companies, whether it's Microsoft, Google, maybe Meta, and a couple of others, really have the wherewithal to be able to train these large language models that can comb the entire world and solve many problems, many questions, but not really super deep in the domains. So to be able to train these models, put the compute behind it, it's extremely costly. Not many people have the scale and the smarts to be able to do it, right?So I think we're going to have three or four companies max really be in the fray for large language models. And then after that, we're going to see an Adobe-specific medium language model, a Salesforce-specific model, a ServiceNow-specific model, and Intuit-specific model, so on and so forth. That is not going to be that contested, because that language model is going to speak that particular domain of personal taxes if you're into it, service automation, if you're ServiceNow creative artist productivity booster for Adobe. Those are relatively locked in. The chances for competition to come and unseat that learning that can happen with these models that work with Adobe, work with Salesforce, work with ServiceNow. That's going to be a little bit hard to surround.But that does not mean that there's not going to be new entrants in the space. You're going to find new architectures, new applications, new problems be attacked by the startups. And there's going to be more new-- net new revenues that will not necessarily affect the incumbents at least for the first couple of years.]"
115,e21371a3-3b5c-3224-bd7f-2b3d09c3d8ab,GS,2023-09-01,Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-bdc-gsbd-upgraded-160005108.html,1693497605,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Goldman Sachs BDC basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Goldman Sachs BDC, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Goldman Sachs BDCThis specialty finance company is expected to earn $2.18 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.7%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Goldman Sachs BDC. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Goldman Sachs BDC to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Financials - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 13, placing it in bottom 19%.Index DetailsThe fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $265.63 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Financials - Broad segment of the equity market.

Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Penumbra due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Penumbra Q2 Earnings Beat, Sales Growth RobustPenumbra reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents by a huge 53.6%. The company had recorded an adjusted income of 1 cent per share in the year-ago period.GAAP earnings per share was 48 cents against a loss per share of 10 cents in the prior-year quarter.Revenues in DetailPenumbra registered revenues of $261.5 million in the reported quarter, up 25.5% year over year on a reported basis as well as at constant exchange rate or CER. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%.Quarter in DetailsThe company reports under two geographical segments — United States and International — as well as under two product categories — Vascular and Neuro.PEN recorded revenues of $186.7 million (71% of total revenues) in the United States, up 32% reportedly as well as at CER year over year.Sales improved 11.7% to $74.7 million in the International segment. Excluding foreign currency impact, the unit’s sales were up 11.6% year over year.The company registered revenues of $152.7 million from sales of vascular products, up 23.6% reportedly and 23.7% at CER from the prior-year level. There was 50% year-over-year growth in U.S. thrombectomy. The international Vascular business witnessed relatively flat year-over-year sales.Sales of neuro products totaled $108.8 million, up 28.3% reportedly and 28.1% at CER. This business reported strong contribution from new products in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.Story continuesMargin TrendIn the reported quarter, Penumbra’s gross profit improved 24.5% to $166.9 million. However, gross margin contracted 52 basis points to 63.8% on a 27.4% rise incost of revenues.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 11.2% to $127.4 million. Research and development expenses totaled $21.5 million, up 10.1% year over year. Total operating expenses came in at $148.9 million, up 11% from that recorded in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted operating income amounted to $17.9 million against the prior-year quarter’s reported loss of $0.1 million.Financial UpdatePenumbra exited second-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments of $114.2 million compared with the first-quarter record of $199.1 million.2023 Sales Guidance RaisedPenumbra issued updated guidance for 2023 revenues. The company expects net sales in the range of $1.05-$1.07 billion, implying a 24-26% improvement year over year. Previously, PEN anticipated sales to be in the band of $1.04-$1.06 billion in 2023. It expects the vascular business to grow slightly above the 24-26% range and the neuro business to remain below this guidance.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Penumbra has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Penumbra has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPenumbra belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry. Another stock from the same industry, Hologic (HOLX), has gained 0.9% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.Hologic reported revenues of $984.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.8%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.95 a year ago.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%.

Now, the company is hoping it can carry out an offscreen surprise in its own business as its competitors pile into live sports programming.Streaming companies like Apple, Google-owned YouTube and Amazon are all betting big on sports. Apple is paying $250 million per year to show every Major League Soccer match for 10 years (CEO Tim Cook name-checked soccer superstar Lionel Messi three times in the company’s most recent earnings call). And NFL rights are reportedly costing Amazon and YouTube a respective $1 billion and $2 billion annually.Netflix—the platform with the highest number of subscribers at 238 million—appears to be stuck on the sidelines. In November, it will host its first ever live sporting event: a celebrity golf tournament. It’s a far cry from the razzle dazzle of Monday Night Football.But Netflix’s sports strategy is not as lackluster as it might seem. The company is taking a different approach to cash in on viewer demand for sports programming. Instead of plunking down huge sums of money for broadcast rights to games—something that co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said Netflix hasn’t found a way to do profitably—Netflix is using its strength in storytelling to create a deep catalog of docu-series about various sports and athletes.Netflix users might recognize the slew of sports content that has materialized on their home pages in recent years, much of which adheres to a similar format: A camera crew follows a set of athletes through their season for a behind-the-scenes look at their wins, losses and personal lives. The first for Netflix was Formula 1: Drive to Survive, a five-season show following race car drivers, managers and team owners. Netflix has expanded its unofficial genre to include Break Point about tennis stars, Full Swing for golf, Quarterback, Cheer, Tour de France: Unchained and more. It isn’t slowing down. Earlier this month, the company announced it is developing a series following track and field athletes.Story continuesThis strategy lets Netflix reach the same sports-loving audience without having to pay the steep price of showing live sports, says Dan Rayburn, an independent streaming industry analyst and consultant. He reckons the cost of sports documentaries is also significantly lower than the fictional scripted series that Netflix produces.And unlike live sporting events, a highly perishable form of content, documentaries about athletes and sports can retain their appeal with viewers for a longer period of time.It is difficult to determine how profitable these sports docu-series are for Netflix, because it doesn’t release figures for the genre. “But if it wasn’t working, they wouldn’t keep making more,” Rayburn told Fortune. Why sports leagues love docu-seriesThe idea isn’t totally novel. HBO, part of streaming service Max, premiered Hard Knocks in 2001. The series follows NFL teams through training camp, and it is still on air. Hard Knocks was a reference point for the team that created Netflix’s Drive to Survive on what the show should look and feel like, according to Paul Martin, co-founder of Box to Box Films, which produced the racing docu-series. Drive to Survive routinely sits on Netflix’s Top 10 Most Watched list when new seasons come out, with more than 6.8 million people having tuned into the show, according to YouGov Sports, a sports research company. Nielsen credits the show for creating a 2.3% increase in Formula 1 auto-racing viewership, as part of a larger 10% bump since 2019. Formula 1 was also able to sell its broadcasting rights to ESPN in 2022 for more than $75 million per year, skyrocketing from the previous $5 million they were worth, according to the Sports Business Journal.“After the success of Drive to Survive, sports leagues looked around and realized they could do that kind of show and have a similar effect on their sport,” Martin told Fortune. Along with Drive to Survive, Martin produced Break Point, Full Swing and Tour de France: Unchained. He is also producing the new docu-series about runners for Netflix.In other words, Netflix is tapping into the interest in individual sports and driving up the value of the sporting events, without shouldering the cost of the increased demand.WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 19: Mikel Arteta, Bradley Wright-Phillips, and Sacha Kljestan on Apple TV before a game between Arsenal and Major League Soccer at Audi Field on July 19, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Stephen Nadler/ISI Photos/Getty Images)Live sports bring huge audiences, with 58 million Americans watching sporting events at least once per month, according to the most recent data from Statista in 2021. But it can be difficult to make money broadcasting live games. The rights are expensive, and negotiations are difficult and time-consuming. Amazon reportedly lost “hundreds of millions” of dollars its first year streaming Thursday Night Football, according to The Information. For YouTube, experts expect the Sunday Ticket will act as a loss leader. DirecTV, which formerly owned the rights, was reportedly losing $500 million on the package annually.By sitting out of the live sports competition, Netflix also avoids the costs and logistical challenges of broadcasting live, including hiring camera crews and announcers. Netflix had technical trouble in April when the tech behind its live Love Is Blind reunion failed—if something like that happened during the final minutes of a big game, the damage to the Netflix brand could be massive.Better than a true crime seriesWhile some sports docu-series with this all-access style have found homes on other streaming platforms—like Make or Break about professional surfers on Apple TV+—it’s noteworthy that most have ended up on Netflix.“The tennis guys were set in wanting to be with Netflix because of the reach and audience,” Martin said about producing Break Point. The idea for the show started with him and the Association of Tennis Professionals, the governing body of men’s tennis. They then brought in the Women’s Tennis Association and pitched the series to Netflix, he said.For the upcoming track and field series, the idea came from a lunch with Netflix where someone said, “Why don’t we just do the 100 meters?” according to Martin. Everyone thought it was a great idea, and Netflix brought in World Athletics, the professional association behind the sport, he said.“Everyone in the sports world understands there’s an appetite for these shows,” Martin said. It makes sense for Netflix to stay with this model rather than purchasing the rights to the sports games. Netflix isn’t in the business of creating value in something and then having to pay larger prices for rights, he said.As for the future of the genre, consumers can expect to see more streaming companies shift their budgets to produce live sports docu-series, according to Rayburn, the streaming analyst. Companies are always moving money towards what’s hot, from police procedurals to reality dating series to true crime. And right now, he said, people are talking about the style of sports documentaries Netflix has its money on.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

I think that if you were to avoid the satire, it could easily take you towards some form of empathy (towards Pinochet), and that's not acceptable,"" said Larrain.During Pinochet's bloody 17-year dictatorship, 1,469 people were forcibly disappeared, and thousands more tortured as political prisoners, according to the Ministry of Justice, based on fact-finding by various commissions.Pinochet, who died in December 2006 at the age of 91, was never convicted of his responsibility for the crimes.""There is a resurgence of the extreme right in Chile and I think this film is needed because it shows who Pinochet was and the things he did, the horrors he committed,"" said 28-year-old Chilean actress Paula Luchsinger, who plays a young nun in ""El Conde"".""And I think that this is needed so that it never happens again.""

Driver told reporters.Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Driver has been closely associated with Netflix in the past, representing two of their films in previous Venice festivals - ""White Noise"" in 2022 and ""Marriage Story"" in 2019.Writers have been on strike since May while actors walked off the job in July.The dual stoppages have shut down both television and movie productions in Hollywood, but some projects that have no affiliation to the big studios are receiving waivers to keep on working if they comply with the most recent union demands.""Every time people from SAG go and support a movie that has agreed to these terms, the interim agreement, it just makes it more obvious that these people are willing to support the people that they collaborate with and the others are not,"" said Driver.Michael Mann, who directed ""Ferrari"", told reporters that he managed to complete the movie thanks to sacrifices made by some of the actors, producers and himself.""People who worked on 'Ferrari' made it by forgoing large percentages of their salaries, in the case of Adam and myself. The producers ... basically worked for no fees,"" Mann said.""No big studio wrote us a check. And that's why we're here, standing in solidarity with both unions.""

(NYSE:TJX). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine TJX Companies’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies What Is TJX Companies Worth?According to my valuation model, TJX Companies seems to be fairly priced at around 3.5% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TJX Companies today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $95.83, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, TJX Companies has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from TJX Companies?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. TJX Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 31%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TJX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TJX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing TJX Companies at this point in time.

134,e95add93-2c13-3b8d-9e4d-c9a6f326d15e,TJX,2023-09-01,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Target and TJX Companies,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-earnings-trends-highlights-target-121700081.html,1693484220,STORY,"['TGT', 'TJX', '^GSPC', 'WMT']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 31, 2023– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Q2 was the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines. The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards.""A Positive Earnings Trend EmergesNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook beginning to improve in recent months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing.This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared 'earnings cliff' narrative.Q2 was the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines. The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -1.5% on +0.7% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT in recent days, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2's weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Unlike Walmart, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Story continuesWalmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 98.4% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -1.5%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn't show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn't leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management's guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

X/Twitter users were quick to point out the hypocrisy of the post, saying the drug companies are also single entities that arbitrarily set medicine prices.""As opposed to the current system, where you arbitrarily set medicine prices high enough to satisfy your shareholders and pay your CEOs obscene salaries?"" wrote @joekatz45.Another user, @DrMattDSW, wrote, ""lmao when did we ever have input into our (outrageously expensive) Rx prices? Never. We’ve never had input. And considering how much research is funded by the government (which means through our tax dollars) I am more than okay with lower prices for everyone. Get bent.""What @WhiteHouse isn't telling you: They're giving a single government agency power to arbitrarily set medicine prices with little accountability, oversight or input from patients &amp; their doctors—with consequences long after this administration is gone. https://t.co/t5UeVnWftr https://t.co/YnGpmUUDl4— PhRMA (@PhRMA) August 29, 2023Yahoo Finance spoke with a half-dozen health policy experts about the backlash, which continued to escalate late Wednesday — more than 24 hours after the post was published.Story continuesAndrew Mulcahy, senior health economist at The RAND Corporation, said the tweet was a little off-target — especially in claiming that the government was arbitrarily setting prices without input from patients and doctors.""Congress was very specific in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. There is a very long guidance document that HHS [Health and Human Services] put out that got commented on, and revised. It's hard to say that they're doing it without patients and doctors,"" Mulcahey said.Anna Kaltenboeck, a former senior health adviser on the Senate Finance Committee who helped write the IRA, reposted the tweet from PhRMA and ""fixed"" it to reflect support for the law.""They are railing against a policy that more than 80% of Americans agree with ... that's both Democrats and Republicans. So if you have that level of unity on an issue and we are this divided as a country, on a partisan basis, that tells you something,"" Kaltenboeck, principal and head of drug reimbursement at healthcare research firm ATI Advisory, told Yahoo Finance.Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said the social media post was a sign of how aggressively the industry is fighting negotiations.""The fact that the drug industry is continuing to fight this shows they’re worried that it’s a foot in the door for broader government price-setting powers. I have to believe PhRMA is hoping for a Republican sweep in 2024, with the potential to roll back or slow down price negotiation,"" Levitt said.Michael Sinha, assistant professor of law at St. Louis University of Law, agreed. He said that though the Congressional Budget Office estimates show low impact to innovation and drug R&amp;D, the industry is still looking to rally support to overturn the IRA if the upcoming election gives it a favorable political environment to do so.""PhRMA doesn’t want to go down without a fight. It is used to winning,"" he said.Legal battle aheadPharmaceutical companies have filed more than a half-dozen lawsuits in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected. The lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging the companies are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Sinha said the suits are ""bizarre"" and would set a dangerous precedent if the industry wins. KFF's Levitt said the outcome is still uncertain.""The pharmaceutical industry may yet be successful at using the courts to stop government negotiation of drug prices, but I think they're going to have a tough time winning over the public. Giving the government authority to negotiate drug prices in Medicare is enormously popular across partisan lines, and the public doesn't buy the arguments against it,"" Levitt added.The Biden Administration has similarly said it will be hard to put the cat back in the bag.""It's important to remember that basically what pharma is arguing in these court cases is that they should have no limit to be able to charge whatever they want, and that is exactly why Americans support Medicare drug negotiations,"" said Biden's domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden on Tuesday.Kaltenboeck said she is confident the law will stand up in court.""We tried our very best to make this thing as navigable as possible for all the stakeholders involved, and clear as possible,"" she said.Tanden noted that given that the negotiation process is happening publicly, with the prices published next September, it will be hard to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act — just as it has been to repeal the Affordable Care Act — and to ""claw back these benefits, these lower prices,"" Tanden said.A health economist, who was not authorized to speak to media, said there could be negative ramifications to the economics of drug research with this move by the administration.""Overall I find the whole discussion about this being 'popular' or 'polling well' a bit silly. Unsurprisingly, people like paying less for something. And we aren’t forcing people to consider that they are also going to pay for low prices today with fewer drugs in the future,"" the economist said.Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale University, said the lobbying firm's tweet showed how tone-deaf it was to the majority of public opinion.""Nearly 20 years ago, PhRMA pulled the biggest hoax on the American people in successfully lobbying Congress to not negotiate reasonable prices of drugs as almost every other similar country does. This is long overdue and this tweet and their lawsuits make clear that PhRMA continues to prioritize maximizing their profits instead of patient access,"" she said.Kaltenboeck added that the industry has no obligation to offer its products through Medicare, and has for too long been forcing Medicare to sell at whatever prices they set.""You don't have to sell your drugs to Medicare, there is no Constitutional obligation. So they are free to avoid the program,"" she said.PhRMA declined to comment.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Shares have lost about 2.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PSEG due for a breakout?

Its commercial and industrial sales volumes accounted for 5,914 million kilowatt-hours, registering a decline of 5% from the same period last year.Other sales were 71 million kilowatt-hours, down 1% from the year-ago quarter figure.Total gas sales volumes witnessed a decrease of 11% in firm sales volumes and a drop of 19% in the non-firm sales volumes of gas from the year-ago quarter figure.Highlights of the ReleaseIn the second quarter of 2023, the operating income came in at $794 million compared with the operating income of $296 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting massive growth from the prior-year period. Total operating expenses were $1,627 million, down 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesSegmental PerformancePSE&amp;G:The net income was $341 million, up from $305 million in the prior-year quarter.PSEG Power &amp; Other: Adjusted operating earnings were $10 million compared with operating earnings of $15 million in the prior-year quarter.Financial UpdateThe long-term debt (including the current portion of the long-term debt) as of Jun 30, 2023 was $19,666 million compared with $20,270 million as of Dec 31, 2022PSEG generated $2,409 million in cash from operations during the six months ended Jun 30, 2023 compared with the $356 million generated in the prior-year period.2023 GuidanceThe company reaffirmed its 2023 guidance. PEG expects its adjusted operating earnings in the range of $1,700-$1,750 million and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.40-$3.50.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Newark, NJ.Valued at $276.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 29, 2024. Work related to this deal will be carried out in different locations across the United States.Benefits of 155mm ProjectilesExcalibur 155 mm projectile is an extended range guided artillery shell that accurately extends the reach of .39-caliber artillery to 40 km and .52-caliber artillery to more than 50 km. Its overall precision, coupled with the ability to be integrated on multiple gun systems, enables both the United States and its coalition partners provide overmatch capabilities against land targets in a variety of combat environments, including stationary land targets.This weapon is fully qualified in multiple systems, including the M777, M109 series, M198, the Archer and PzH2000. It’s also currently compatible with the AS90, K9, DENEL G6 and CAESAR 6x6 systems.  Due to its variety of advantages, nations like Sweden, Canada, Australia, Jordan, India and the Netherlands have already chosen the Excalibur precision-guided projectile to address vital security interests, while several other international militaries are finalizing procurement plans. This surely reflects the solid demand that this weapon system enjoys in the artillery market, which in turn leads to inflow of contracts for RTX, the latest contract win being a bright example of that.Looking aheadIncreasing geo-political tensions across the globe have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold, with artillery forces being one of them.Increasing military investments in the development of new and advanced artillery system are being witnessed lately, thereby bolstering the artillery market’s prospects. Notably, as per the Mordor Intelligence firm’s forecast, the global artillery systems market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.2% in the 2023-2028 period. This should benefit RTX Corp. with its 155 mm projectile having the capacity to increase precision, minimize collateral damage and reduce the logistical burden for artillery forces.Story continuesPeer ProspectsOther defense majors that should benefit from the growing artillery market are:BAE Systems BAESY: It is the co-developer of Excalibur 155 mm projectile, along with RTX.

141,9acd83d1-f12f-3eca-b0c5-73b40d89a924,ZTS,2023-09-01,20 Most Popular Pets In The US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-popular-pets-us-025344017.html,1693536824,STORY,"['ZTS', 'FRPT']","[In this article, we take a look at the 20 most popular pets in the US. You can skip our detailed analysis of the pet industry and go directly to the 5 Most Popular Pets in the US.Popularity of Pets in the USAccording to an APPA survey, pets are a vital part of the American lifestyle, with 70% of US households having at least one, which makes up almost 90.5 million homes. The ownership numbers vary significantly across generations, with millennials currently being the generation with the highest number of pet owners, amounting to 33% of total pet owners in the United States.This massive influx of pets has contributed immensely to the flow of wealth in the economy. According to Forbes Advisor, Americans spent $136.8 billion on their pets in just the year 2022, which included a range of purchases such as food, toys, grooming services, veterinary care, and other miscellaneous products. This increase in expenditure has also helped the US become the 3rd highest-paying country for veterinarians. The money comes largely from Gen Z pet owners, who are likelier to spend on specialized services and products, including, but not limited to, pet walking, behavioral training, and special costumes. Almost 5.3 million pets in the US have been insured, with the highest percentage of insured pets being dogs, per NAIC. Dogs are also the most popular pets in the US because of their smartness and loyal nature. While there are many jobs that will disappear in the future due to AI, the growth of the pet industry has given rise to a whole spectrum of new jobs ranging from laidback jobs like pet walking and training to more demanding employment such as that in the pet healthcare and service industries. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected a 29% growth in the overall employment of animal care and service workers from 2021 to 2031. More than 80,900 job openings are expected to open up each year in the decade. The availability of jobs in the pet industry creates opportunities for both full-time professionals as well as part-time job searchers. Story continuesPets Industry AnalysisAccording to Mordor Intelligence, the US pet market is the largest in all of North America in terms of revenue, with a market size of $76.80 billion in 2023. This number is expected to grow to $98.30 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 5.06% during these five years. Much of this expansion can be attributed to the millennial attitude shift towards pets, as well as the changing perceptions around being a pet owner. More individuals now recognize the positive life impacts of having a pet in the house and, hence, are more likely to buy one. People in the US tend to invest good money in the procurement of the best food supplies as well as healthcare services for their pets, which has led to an increase in pet companies that promise innovative results and fresh products. Companies like Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) and FreshPet (NASDAQ:FRPT) are some of the leading companies that provide quality pet-related products and services. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) works to develop health technologies for pets, and the company generated $1.57 billion in profits in just the second quarter of 2023 alone.Aristotle Atlantic Core Equity Strategy had the following to say about Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) in their Q1, 2023 investor letter:“Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) is a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products, and services, biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health technology. It has a diversified business, commercializing products across eight core species: dogs, cats, horses, cattle, swine, poultry, fish, and sheep within seven major product categories: vaccines, parasiticides, anti-infectives, dermatology, other pharmaceutical products, medicated feed additives and animal health diagnostics. Zoetis boasts approximately 300 product lines sold in more than 100 countries around the world, making it one of the world’s largest animal health businesses. Approximately 53% of the company’s total revenue is generated from the US.We believe that Zoetis is working to help improve the lives of animals, which has societal benefits in the companion animal arena. Within livestock, healthier animals can provide increased productivity and yield as the growing world population seeks more safe food sources and additional sources of protein.""FreshPet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT) has been in the market for 17 years, during which time it has curated all-natural meals for all kinds of pets, especially dogs. FreshPet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT) experienced a growth of 26% in net sales during the second quarter of 2023 which, according to the company's CEO, is a stepping stone towards achieving their goal of $1.8 billion worth of net sales in 2027. FreshPet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRPT) has also increased their consumption volume by 4% compared to Q1 of 2023. The growth of the e-commerce sector has also contributed to higher revenue in the pet industry as it has allowed smaller pet-related businesses to reach out to potential customers. Social media has also enabled students to take up part-time gigs as pet walkers or sitters, encouraging the youth to become a part of the job market. Let's now head over to the list of the most popular pets in America.20 Most Popular Pets in the USPhoto by James Lacy on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor compiling this list of the 20 most popular pets in the US, we have delved into consensus rankings based on data from various sources such as the World Animal Foundation, APPA, Forbes Advisor, and Insider. The pets have been ranked based on the number of sources that have listed them as popular pets, along with the number of US households with a pet of that species.Based on these two measures, here are the 20 most popular pets in the US: 20. IguanasNumber of households: 200,000The US has almost 6 million households with a reptile as a pet, as noted by Forbes, and while the exact number of iguanas is unknown, many sources have mentioned it as one of the most popular reptiles to have as a pet. Pets like these have been gaining popularity as people move towards busier corporate lifestyles and the demand for pets requiring lesser attention increases. States like Hawaii and Texas are rich in iguana populations and, hence, have been giving rise to a local market for these reptiles. 19. Ferrets Number of households: 326,000Ferrets used to be much more popular pets historically and were kept in almost 1 million households because they were readily available at every pet store and were relatively smaller in size. But their popularity has fallen recently due to their high maintenance as well as some legal restrictions. For example, keeping pet ferrets is illegal in the states of California and Hawaii, and certain other cities and counties have implemented strict regulations regarding this practice.18. Rats Number of households: 400,000Rats are generally dismissed as a serious consideration for pets because many assume them to be pests. However, veterinarians mention that rats explicitly bred to become pets tend to develop emotional bonds with their owners. This characteristic makes them unique from other rodents, which are known for typically biting their owners.17. Livestock Number of households: 494,000Livestock is generally bred for economic purposes, with the industry being the economic backbone of many states, such as Nebraska. But that doesn’t mean that joyful companions cannot be found in these animals. Cows are extraordinary pets that showcase high levels of affection for their owners and tend to connect with them pretty well. Livestock animals require very particular care in regard to their health, and companies like Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) meet these needs with pertinent healthcare products such as vaccines and medication.16. Mice Number of households: 500,000Mice are generally easy to take care of and make for a pretty entertaining indoor pet. They don’t need to be walked outside, but they can be taught a plethora of tricks with training and some patience.People who look for sociable and active animals tend to prefer mice as these tiny rodents exhibit the perfect amount of these two qualities. 15. Bearded dragons  Number of households: 670,000Despite these animals requiring very particular care due to them being native to a specific Australian atmosphere, they’re preferred as pets due to their gentle nature and visual aesthetics. Bearded dragons need precise temperatures for maintenance and a large amount of space. Despite these conditions, their nature makes them quite lovable and lands them their spot in the list of 20 most popular pets in the US. 14. Guinea PigsNumber of households: 1 millionGuinea pigs are not as popular as hamsters, but they follow closely behind and still make their spot in the 20 most popular pets in the US. They are especially loved in households that have younger kids. The small animal is super fun and active to play with and exhibits a highly sociable energy. The guinea pig food industry in the US is expected to become a multimillion-dollar market by 2030. 13. Snakes Number of households: 1.2 millionThe general perceptions around snakes would have one thinking that they might not make good companions, but this list of the 20 most popular pets in the US tells a different story. Ball pythons and corn snakes are two of the most popular snake breeds in the country, and they’re significantly changing how people view reptiles. 12. PoultryNumber of households: 1.3 millionPoultry is another category of pets that has always been predominantly viewed as a means to economic gains, but the practice is now changing. People are now resorting to keeping their own hens in the backyard because it helps to know that your eggs are coming from ethically raised animals in a sustainable environment. Moreover, people consider this a method to generate a connection with agriculture in their urban lifestyles. 11. HamstersNumber of households: 1.5 millionhamsters are among the most popular American pets. They only require a little space and are easy to care for, making them a fantastic option for people who are busier in their work lives. 10. Rabbits Number of households: 1.5 millionMillennials form the highest percentage of small animal owners, with rabbits being the most popular among them. They started out as suitable pets for children in the 90s, but those children have continued finding companionship with the species well into adulthood. Since they require very little space, they’re perfect for millennials residing primarily in apartments and smaller houses. 9. TurtlesNumber of households: 2 millionThis pet might have a tough exterior, but owners generally find turtles to be quite friendly, which makes them among the 20 most popular pets in the US. Turtles are another species that has succumbed to poaching efforts due to their rising popularity. This poaching is contributing to the global decline of turtle populations. Hence, voices are now being raised for the ethical and legal sale of the animal, and stricter curbing of poaching efforts. Under these circumstances, The Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences has designed a survey to map out consumer preferences regarding turtles and has suggested best ethical practices toward them.8. Horse Number of households: 2.2 millionHorses are generally considered a symbol of status and wealth, making them a popular pet choice despite their expensive price tags. The number of horse owners has decreased over the last decade owing to their caring needs and rising costs, but their grandeur keeps attracting people towards them. 7. Saltwater fish Number of households: 2.9 millionIt is estimated that in the year 2022, the US ornamental fish market stood at a value of $1.42 billion. Saltwater fish are not as common as their freshwater counterparts, but they still snag a spot among the top ten in the list of the 20 most popular pets in the US. Fish are generally kept in homes for aesthetic purposes, and saltwater fish are very colorful, making them a popular choice. 6. ChinchillasNumber of households: 5 millionChinchillas are one of the cheaper pets to own as they don’t consume a lot of food; hence, not much of the owner’s budget goes towards that. They also require little space like other small animals, which is another plus point. They are also cleaner than other rodents and can live up to 20 years if cared for properly. Chinchillas also don’t shed as much fur as some of their other small animal counterparts, which makes them optimal for houses with allergy-prone individuals. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Popular Pets in the US.

Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.Don Zurbay: Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Patterson had a strong start to fiscal ‘24, building upon our momentum across the business as we continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. A few highlights from our first quarter. On the top line, year-over-year internal sales increased approximately 3% with growth across both the dental and animal health segments. Our initiatives to drive margin improvement were successful as we achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion across the company, and the dental and animal health segments. We returned $55 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases and we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 25% from the same period a year ago.Given these results, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2024 earnings guidance. As a reminder, our guidance accounts for our commitment to deliver year-over-year internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion for the total company and across both our dental and animal health segments. Our performance during our fiscal ‘24 first quarter illustrates the continued execution of our proven strategy, which as I shared last quarter is designed to achieve four core objectives: First, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates. Second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance. Third, evolve our products, channels, and services to best serve the customers in our end markets. And fourth, improve efficiency and optimization.Our team is aligned around various strategic initiatives to advance each of these core objectives. Today, I'd like to highlight just a couple of specific examples that we've been working on in early fiscal 2024 to demonstrate our progress. First, our focus on private label. During the first quarter, we benefited from continued growth in our private label portfolio, which includes the collection of owned brands with strong market equity. These include brands we've built like the Patterson brand in dental, in the Aspen and Pivotal companion vet products, as well as acquired brands like Dairy Tech in the production animal business. We have invested in this important category by adding new SKUs and our sales team is highly engaged and motivated to drive sales growth in this margin accretive category.We continually evaluate opportunities across our businesses, but believe there is a distinct opportunity within animal health to further expand the private label portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences. In fact during fiscal ’24 we expect to add more private labe; products to our animal house offering than ever before. Over the past several years, our private label sales growth outpaced the sales growth of products manufactured by our strategic partners. The results are paying off and in addition to generating above market growth, our focus on private labels supports our other core objectives. Another recent example relates to our efforts to improve efficiency and optimization. As we've said before, this objective includes not only a rigorous focus on cost discipline, but also targeted investments to leverage best practices and advance operational excellence across the enterprise.We have recently been implementing a strategic modernization of our fulfillment facilities and capabilities. This includes investments in new technology such as robots and cobots to automate order picking, enhancements for our teams to ensure the right skills and expertise to operate the more modern facilities and substantial expansions of our fulfillment capacity. Just this week, we are opening a brand new fulfillment center in the U.K., we call the [Big Shed] (ph) that will double our capacity in the region. This fully automated next generation facility is not just larger. It's more sustainable, more efficient, and further advances our channel capabilities. We also recently completed a technology overhaul to our fulfillment center in Southern California and are close to opening an expanse facility in Montreal, Canada.In addition, we have similar projects underway in several other locations. These strategic investments in our fulfillment centers can help alleviate capacity constraints and the modernization of our facilities is expected to enhance growth. These are only a couple examples of some of the many initiatives we have underway. Taken together, our strategic areas of focus build upon our strong foundation and success over the past several years to further differentiate our position in the market and drive enhanced growth, profitability, and value creation over the long-term. Now I'll provide some updates on each of our segments during the fiscal first quarter. Let's start with dental. Dental segment internal sales increased 2%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ’23, due to strong growth in consumable and value-added services, which includes our software offerings.We also achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in the fiscal first quarter, due to our dental team's ongoing focus on our margin enhancement initiatives. Our value proposition continues to resonate with all types of dental customers. From individual practices to group practices, we seek to create a seamless experience by offering a comprehensive suite of product and solutions that help dental practices grow, become more efficient, and provide improved patient care. In the consumables category, dental internal sales increased approximately 5% in the fiscal first quarter, compared to one year ago. Excluding the moderating deflationary impact of infection control products, internal sales for our non-infection control consumables increased nearly 7% year-over-year.Overall, we believe the demand we are seeing for consumables products speaks to the resiliency of the dental market, and our ability to drive growth above the current end market. Looking at dental equipment internal sales in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 decreased 6%, compared to the year ago period. Our team delivered growth in our core equipment and CAD/CAM categories that was more than set by a decline in digital technology, which experienced a sequential decline in sales following a strong fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. This dynamic is typical of the variability of the equipment category and further demonstrates how equipment sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter for a variety of factors. Over the last eight quarters, our average quarterly equipment internal sales growth was 4%.Dentists continue to invest in their practices and look to Patterson when they do. We anticipate that demand for equipment and technology will drive our manufacturing partners to continue introducing new innovations and technologies. Patterson is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand, thanks to our expertise in selling, financing, installing, training, and servicing the latest technologies and equipment. And finally, dental internal sales in our software and value-added services category increased approximately 6% over the prior year period. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice, including our leading technical service offering.This category continues to grow at a rate exceeding the overall rate of the dental segment. The strong results we have been delivering in the value-added services category are testament to our customers recognizing the full life cycle support and services that Patterson provides. And as an added benefit, these valuable offerings are mixed favorable to our P&amp;L. Maximizing our value-added service offerings, particularly in the software category, is a key part of our strategy with a meaningful opportunity for growth. Looking ahead, we believe the dental market remains stable with healthy underlying fundamentals, including an aging population, practice modernization and the direct link between a patient's oral health and overall health, which we believe will continue to serve as tailwinds and help drive performance across our dental segment over the long-term.Now let's move on to our animal health segment. During the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 animal health internal sales increased 4% year-over-year, with growth in both companion animal and production animal businesses. We also achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in the animal health segment, building upon our excellent track record of margin improvement over the past few years. We benefit from the depth of our offering and omnichannel presence expands a wide range of animal species and offers comprehensive solutions for diverse customers. In companion animal, our internal sales in the fiscal quarter increased by mid-single-digits, as we executed well within this healthy and growing market. As we've said before, we've been modeling mid-single-digit revenue growth for our companion business over the long-term.13 Most Profitable Small BusinessesSyda Productions/Shutterstock.comOn the production animal side, fiscal 2024 first quarter internal sales grew by low-single-digits, despite ongoing headwinds within the cattle market, we have continued to deliver sales growth in this part of the animal health business. This is a testament to our team's performance and the diversification of our production business. Across the animal health segment, our value-added services category achieved strong growth that can be attributed to sales of our software solutions and equipment service, as well as operational efficiencies. Expanding our investments in software and value-added services remains a priority for us and is core to our objective to position Patterson animal health as the leading provider of technology, software, data insights, services, and products to the animal health industry.Our team stands ready to help our customers identify the right set of solutions to streamline their workflows and run their practices efficiently, all backed by our unbeatable service and support. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results.Kevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our first quarter of fiscal ’24, which ended on July 29th 2023, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our first quarter of fiscal ‘24. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal ‘24 first quarter were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3.5% over the first quarter of one year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions increased 2.8%, compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was 20.2%, a decrease of 25 basis points, compared to the prior year period.Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 40 basis points this quarter by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment from rising interest rates on our equipment financing portfolio. As we have mentioned in prior earnings calls, any positive or negative impact related to our equipment financing portfolio is nearly offset by our corresponding hedging instrument, which is reflected in the other income net line on our P&amp;L, so the net results has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. This dynamic also occurred in the first fiscal quarter of last year, and the positive impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculations of 10 basis points. When normalizing for the mark-to-market accounting adjustment in both periods, our gross margin rate in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal ‘23.Remember, the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin, but not the gross margin within our business segments. Importantly, during the fiscal first quarter, both of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins, compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal ’24 were 17.2% and favorable by 40 basis points compared to the fiscal first quarter of ‘23. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, our consolidated adjusted operating margin 3.0%, an increase of 15 basis points, compared to the first quarter of last year. Again, when normalizing for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting in both periods related to gross margin.Our consolidated adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 expanded by 60 basis points over the prior year period. I am pleased with the team's efforts to continuously improve and deliver on our commitment to drive operating margin expansion within our business segments and for the total company overall in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24. The initiatives we put in place to improve gross margin, to work more closely with strategic vendors, who reward us for our sales performance, drive improved mix, exercise expense, discipline, and leverage our cost structure has certainly translated into a higher level of profitability and financial performance for Patterson. Our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was 23.5%, an increase of 110 basis points, compared the prior year period.Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $31.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the first quarter of last year of $24.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, was $38.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This compares to $31.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal ’23. This 25% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal first quarter is primarily due to the sales execution and operating margin expansion in both of our business segments. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with our dental business.In the first quarter of fiscal of ’23, internal sales for our dental increased 2.1%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ’23. Internal sales of dental consumables in the fiscal first quarter increased 4.6% compared to one year ago and were impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection control products. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 6.9% in the first quarter of fiscal ’24, compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection control product deflation has continued to moderate over the past year, and we expect the year-over-year deflationary effect to continue moderating and fully normalized by the end of fiscal year ‘24. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, internal sales of dental equipment decreased 5.7%, compared to one year ago.As Don mentioned, sales in the equipment category can vary from quarter-to-quarter and these dynamics apply to each of the specific product categories as well. This quarter, core equipment and CAD/CAM sales posted positive year-over-year sales growth, but were more than offset by a decline in the digital x-ray category, compared to the prior year period. Internal sales of value-added services in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 increased 5.8% over the prior year period, led by the increased year-over-year contribution from our technical service team and continued growth of our software business. Value-added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers to help make us an indispensable partner to their practice and these valuable offerings are also mixed favorable to our P&amp;L.The adjusted operating margin in dental was 7.4% in the first quarter of fiscal ’24, which represents a 35 basis point improvement over the prior. This operating margin performance reflects the efforts of our dental team to improve margins through effective pricing and mix management and continued expense discipline to deliver operating margin expansion for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24. Now let's move on to our animal health segment. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, internal sales for our animal health business increased 4.0%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ‘23. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 increased 5.1% over the prior year period, which included strong sales performance from our [NVS] (ph) business in the U.K. Internal sales for our production animal business in the first quarter increased 2.5% in the quarter, compared to the prior year period.Our production animal team continues to execute well in the market, and internal sales in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 delivered particularly strong growth in the swine category, compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin in our animal health segment was 4.0% in the fiscal ‘24 first quarter, an increase of nearly 80 basis points from the prior year period. Our animal health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturer partners who value our ability to deliver increased sales, while also exercising expense disciplines, they delivered operating margin expansion for the first quarter of fiscal form. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first three months of fiscal ‘24, our free cash flow improved by $35.7 million compared to the same period one year ago.This was primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first three months of fiscal ’24, compared to the year ago period. Turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $17.1 million and $2.5 million higher than the first quarter of fiscal ‘23. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities, as well as our software and value-added services. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal ‘24. We also repurchased $29.5 million of shares during the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, thereby returning a total of $54.9 million to shareholders to dividends and share repurchases.Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal ‘24. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal ‘24 GAAP earnings guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share. And now I'm going to turn the call back over to Don for some additional time.Don Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for a great start to fiscal 2024 as we made progress to build upon our momentum across the business. We're continuing to deliver on our proven strategy and combined with the resilient end markets in which we operate. I'm confident that we are well positioned to drive enhanced growth profitability, and value creation over the long-term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.See also 18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now and Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Stock Picks.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.Jason Bednar: Hey. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Yes, Don or Kevin, I want to start, you know, the dental consumable performance was really strong really seems to defy expectations that I think many have out there on the dental market at the moment. I heard the private label commentary, but could you unpack a bit more where the strength is coming from that's supporting that 7% underlying growth in consumables? Any procedure categories to call out where you're seeing notable strength or anything of note on, you know, BSOs, pricing, share gains, anything like that?Don Zurbay: Yes. Thanks, Jason. You know, we're trying to be helpful here. We're not going to probably break down pieces, but quite honestly, we saw strength across the board. I think, you know, patient traffic is steady. We feel really good about that. All customer types performed, you know, and the salesforce really, I think, is just, hitting on all cylinders right now. We think the momentum, the key to this quarter and last quarter are just kind of where we're at right now is just, the continued momentum in the business. So, you know, not to be able to break that down for you, but, honestly, it was across the board.Jason Bednar: Okay. Alright. No, that's helpful. I'm sure others will have probably have questions there as well. But, maybe just for a follow-up, I did want to ask, I mean, Don you highlighted those corporate investments don't think we've heard, you know, those kind of specifics in the past that sounds like you have a lot of wheels in motion across your facilities, your distribution network. Are you able to quantify all the investments you've made, with some of that automation work and what the ROI or payback you're expecting for some of those investments?Don Zurbay: Yes. Well, if you look at, our CapEx spending this quarter is above last first quarter. And I think what you're going to see is as we go through the year, that'll continue to be the case, you know, all of these projects go through a rigorous process, that we have internally to make sure that the ROI, you know, gets above our cost of capital and that it had all, you know, is the financial payoff, as well as all the other benefits we're getting from it. So we're pretty excited about each of these investments. Obviously, you know, we're not going to see the benefits of these, quite yet, but wanted to highlight some examples of the types of things that we have that are going to keep the margin improvement moving in the right direction.And when we make the commitment to continuously improving the margin. I think this is an example of how that works. So, you know, pretty excited about all of them. I think more to come and what I really like is the team is continues to think about the next thing and the next opportunity.Jason Bednar: Okay, great. Helpful. Thank you.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Nathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Wanted to start with a question on margins. Don, you reiterated expectations for operating margin expansion for the total company, as well as both segments. I guess any change in your expectations for the overall level of margin expansion, I guess, particularly with respect to the dynamics you're seeing in the corporate segment? And then any comments or thoughts on just cadence of margin improvement over the balance of the year?Don Zurbay: I'll maybe let Kevin get into a little of that. I think, you know, I think overall, you know, we're still committed to the margin improvement story both at the corporate level and in each of the business units. And, you know, if anything's changed, it's minor. I think our expectations are the same as they were, as we entered the year.Kevin Barry: Yes. We, you know, we got off to a good start here in Q1 with both of our business units expanding both their gross margins and their operating margins. And so we're seeing that momentum at the business unit level. You alluded to the corporate segment just a reminder, this is a dynamic that we have related to our equipment financing portfolio, whereas the forward interest rate curve changes, we have to mark that portfolio to market, which does create some noise in our corporate segment and our overall margins, which is offset with the hedge we have in our other income line below operating profit. This quarter, it was a bit of a headwind as the forward rate curve increased in that portfolio. And so and that's why we try to give you guys, kind of, the adjusted number, so you can see kind of what that noise taken out of it, how we're performing underneath it.So, you know, we are not going to guess where interest rates are going to go from here, but we'll continue to kind of have that dynamic as interest rates change. But, again, I think you can strip that out and see the underlying momentum there. And then the other thing on phasing, I'd say is that, you know, I think we expect similar cadence where we typically see some leverage as we go through the year, you know, Q1 is typically our lowest op margin level for the year, but as we have higher sales quarters, we typically see leverage on the op margin line for the rest of the year.Don Zurbay: I think, I just, you know, maybe want to reiterate, when you take out the dynamics of the accounting that Kevin mentioned, which you need to do, and look at our margin. I mean, our gross margin was up 20 basis points in the quarter. Like, Kevin mentioned and operating margin up 60 basis points, which I think was notable and I -- you know, want to make sure people understand that dynamic. It's kind of confusing.Nathan Rich: Great, that's helpful. And then, I wanted to ask on the U.S. companion animal business, I know you said overall companion was up 5.1, but I think Kevin, you kind of called out NVS is maybe the main driver of that. Could you comment on how the U.S. companion animal business did? And, you know, any change to your outlook for that business, you know, just giving kind of the overall kind of traffic and level of demand that you're seeing in the market?Kevin Barry: Sure. I can jump in and Don can add -- that we saw growth in both segments. We saw particularly the strong growth in our NVS business, which is, we want to, you know, call them out, they're performing really well in that market. And this is in advance of some of the investments Don mentioned, what you think are even going to accelerate that business further. But the U.S. companion business also did grow in the quarter. Now we're going to -- as you'd expect, we're not seeing the same level of growth as we have over the past couple of years as that market has, you know, kind of moderated a bit from the heights of the pet, pandemic bloom. But -- and in the overall market, we still see spending up, even as visits have come down a bit. So pet teams are executing really well and are -- and they are growing, you know, in the market, so…Don Zurbay: Yes. I think, you know, the 5% is off a fairly tough comp, as Kevin mentioned, with some of the dynamics in the market that were in place last year.Nathan Rich: Great. Thanks very much.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.Jeff Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Don, I wanted to start on your equipment number that down 5.7%. You know, obviously, we've seen many times in the past from you and other companies push hard. It's kind of the fiscal end of year to make some numbers and then the next quarter has a bit of an overhang here. How much of that did -- was an impact this quarter? I mean, obviously, you talked about digital x-ray being down, but I'm hoping you can help us maybe disaggregate, kind of, end market tenure of end markets versus just some timing of when you closed your fiscal year and then made a big push last year and had a bit of an overhang to deal with, in this first quarter? Thanks.Don Zurbay: Yes. No doubt, Jeff, and I think you've seen that in the past. And there's a lot of reasons for it. Obviously, you know, there can be a fourth quarter push, we do budget and forecast for that. And I think, as you mentioned, you know, the digital category sometimes is the one that may see more variability on that kind of dynamic. So, you know, this gets back to, for me, just back to the whole notion of looking at it in the three month increments, particularly [Indiscernible] as you're bringing up in the fourth quarter, first quarter kind of realm. I think the -- if you just looked across the six month period, which might be a better way to think about all that, you know, our equipment sales were up 8% Q4 and Q1 over last year.And then I think the -- so I would just highlight that we -- you know, we keep watching this category, as you all do, I think, in terms of the economy and things. But, all we're seeing is just the -- our customers, desire to continue investing in their practice and that's just not slowing down. It's a good patient traffic, and it's kind of translating to the practices wanting to continue to invest.Jeff Johnson: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just on the EPS guidance, you're obviously up 25% year-over-year this quarter. I think your guidance for the year is low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth year-over-year to full-year. So that would kind of imply kind of flattish EPS over the next three quarters on a year-over-year basis. Just remind us, one, why would that be the right level of EPS growth after a strong start here on the EPS line of the year? And two, how much conservatism versus other factors we might have to be taken into account there.Don Zurbay: Yes. Yes. I think this really actually -- I think this mostly relates just to a bit of phasing on the year. I think that we had a tough comp -- or we had an easy comp in Q1 and obviously, a tough comp in Q4, and there's some other dynamics within the year, but I think it relates more to that than anything. And so when we kind of look back and say, even with all that phasing, we're comfortable with the guidance we've given for the year and that growth even though it comes a little bit different for each quarter.Kevin Barry: Yes, I think the other thing I'd add, Jeff, is there are some -- while we do expect the business to continue to grow over the course of the year, there are some internal investments we're making that will ramp up a bit here into the rest of the year that we think are great investments for the long-term of the company. But we're going to have a little bit of spending that will come through in the back half of the year, too.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.Kevin Caliendo: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one question I had to ask is around what you saw in July. That's the month we don't get to see from anybody else. I'm just wondering if trend through the quarter was consistent or not? I understand on the equipment side, what happened with ordering and timing. I'm just wondering, as you exited the quarter, did you think the demand for equipment changed at all from the beginning of the quarter or from second quarter. We're just trying to get a read on what's going to happen over the rest of the calendar year into next year.Don Zurbay: Yes. No, Kevin, I appreciate the question and a good one. I -- for us, I think the quarter really played out kind of in normal fashion. I don't -- I wouldn't highlight and we probably wouldn't say too much about intra-quarter phasing. But I guess I would say that I don't think that there was nothing notable from my perspective on how the quarter played into the first 2 months versus the last one.Kevin Caliendo: Okay. That's helpful. And also just thinking about with equipment, where are you in terms of relatively speaking, in terms of backlog, whether it's core or digital. Has that normalized? Or do you feel like the backlog in either of those are elevated or lower or normal? Any color around that would be super helpful.Kevin Barry: I think -- this is Kevin. I think what we'd say the core equipment demand continues to be strong. Those supply chains have normalized, I think we'd say, compared to what we were talking about a couple of past year or two. So the lead times aren't as long as they used to be. So that sales cycle has shortened for us, which is good. And then for the digital categories, those sales cycles are pretty quick. We can turn around those orders and installs fairly rapidly, the consults obviously not as complicated as a new office build out. So we don't really think about those in terms of backlog just because the cycle is pretty quick. But I'd say, like Don said, we're seeing healthy demand in the market. Our sales teams are executing really well to help their customers find the right investment for their practice and feel good about the rest of the year.Kevin Caliendo: Do you think that interest rates are the economic situation has held up ordering in any way, shape or form on some of the higher cost equipment in the category? I'm just -- we've heard anecdotally this from -- in the channel and from some of your peers and manufacturers. Just wondering how real you see that as being any kind of impact on the market?Don Zurbay: Yes. I think marginally, not in a significant way, though. And again, we're pleased with the momentum in the business, but the momentum in the market, too, in terms of -- again, in terms of practices willing to invest in their business and it continues. So it's a little more challenging, I think, but still make sense, I think, when they run the math.Kevin Caliendo: Fantastic. Thanks so much, [Indiscernible]Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Block from Stifel. Your line is open.Jon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I guess I'll go back to the underlying Dental consumables, which were seemingly, I guess, the revenue highlight for the quarter. You've got inflation impact starting to diminish. I guess what I'm trying to go with this is, what was the approximate price contribution in fiscal ‘23 for Dental consumables? And how do you see that playing out in fiscal ‘24? I'm just trying to focus on that pricing contribution because I think we all want to arrive at how underlying volumes are trending and if the price contribution for consumables is sort of closer to normalized levels as we currently sit here today.Kevin Barry: Yes, Jon, this is Kevin. Yes, I think we would say that the pricing certainly is kind of more at historical norms, the kind of low-single-digit pricing. As we've looked at our internal data, here, we certainly -- part of our Q1 performance was price contribution, but it was also a positive volume contribution. So we saw units grow this quarter as well. So it wasn't just the one or the other. I think we expect that for some of those infection control products that we've been tracking that year-over-year deflationary impact is going to continue to be a drag for the next couple of quarters. The prices have stabilized but we're still going to be comparing back to a higher kind of ASP basket for those products from last year.So I think as we -- so we'll be dealing with that dynamic for the next couple of quarters. But I think for -- if you kind of look at the category as a whole, we'd say, we're seeing volume contribution as well as kind of more normalized historical price contribution for dental consumables.Jon Block: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then just maybe a small handful as part of the second question. For Dental equipment, should we still expect mid-single-digit growth for the year? Obviously, fiscal 1Q was down. You got a really tough comp in 4Q. So do we still think you can land at mid-single-digits for the year? And Kevin, still tax rate of 25% for the year. Is that correct? You were shy of that for the quarter. And did your messaging change a little bit on the deflationary for the infection control. I thought before that was supposed to ease in the back part of the year? And maybe in your prepared remarks, you sort of said that continues to the end of the fiscal year, maybe some clarification there?Kevin Barry: Yes, I'll take a couple of those. So yes, on the deflation, I think what I'd say is we really saw the prices kind of stabilize at a new level in our Q4 of fiscal '23. So it's probably -- Q2 will have a headwind. Q3 will have a smaller headwind. Q4, it should be pretty marginal sort of how we see the pricing dynamics playing out for, Jon. And then on the tax rate, yes, we'd still say about 25%. We're seeing a step-up this year in our tax rate due to some changes in the U.K. tax law, as well as some historical deductions that have expired for us. So I think that's still the right number for your estimate. And equipment -- yes. And I think -- yes, you're right. We do have some tough comps coming up in equipment the team is still pushing hard on that.I think mid-single-digit long-term. And again, given some -- not looking at quarter-to-quarter, but over a reasonable time frame is what we'd expect. And I just keep reiterating what we're saying is I think the market is looking for these investments. And so we're still pushing to get to that mid-single-digit long-term growth rate for equipment.Don Zurbay: I think the -- Jon, I think the metric we've kind of brought out every quarter is what does it look like if you look over the last 8 quarters, I think the I think the equipment growth is 4% in that time, and it kind of has been. So you can kind of think about it like that. I think the ups and downs here of a year we deal with. But over an 8-quarter period, that's still -- we still think that's a pretty good number.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just a quick question. How are you guys thinking about -- obviously, you have interest expense in the quarter. How are you sort of expecting that to trend for the rest of the year?Kevin Barry: Yes. Yes. So interest expense, we'd expect it to be maybe a little above what we carried here in Q1 for the rest of the next three quarters as we've kind of reforecast where we expect rates to go. And so really, if you look at it versus last year, there will still be a bit of a headwind here in Q2 and Q3, a little bit less in Q4.Elizabeth Anderson: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe on the longer-term side, what are the things that maybe come out in the last of years is that you seem to have a sort of different M&amp;A strategy for the Animal Health business versus the Dental business. It seems like sort of more tuck-ins -- or a more regular cadence of tuck-ins on the animal health side. Can you talk to us a little bit more about sort of maybe why that is? Why you're seeing is this sort of availability of assets? Is it just something unique about that business versus some of the Dental, which is obviously just had more core benefit?Don Zurbay: Yes. Okay. I think there -- first of all, I would start off by saying in terms of our M&amp;A strategy. We're agnostic to some extent between Animal Health and Dental. We're looking for the right opportunities that hit our metrics and that check the box on what we're thinking about in terms of M&amp;A. So I mean I would put this particular dynamic and kind of where we've been over the last few years, it's just the timing of opportunities that come up and when we're ready to do something and how they check the box. I don't know that there's anything particularly unique about animal health that would put us into a position where there's some good tuck-in acquisitions versus Dental. But we're doing a lot of work. There's a lot of work going into all kinds of potential acquisitions.I know we've been saying this, but we're careful. We want to make sure we make the right investments. And so far, this is what we have. But again, I don't think there's anything unique about Animal Health and Dental. They are different businesses, but we're looking for the right opportunities.Elizabeth Anderson: Got it. More for me. Just how do you think about the private label opportunity? I know you sort of talked about that particular -- is there something you can sort of like quantify there? And I know you said you're adding more products than before, but how do we think about that as like a driver of margins in that business?Don Zurbay: Well, I think what you're going to see is private label becoming a more prominent part of our program. I mean, it's slow, we're not we're not accelerating at any -- at a significantly rapidly pace. So I mean we move carefully, but definitely, there's a strategic objective to make that a bigger part of our business and our sales in both the Animal Health and Dental businesses.Elizabeth Anderson: Got it. Thanks.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Obviously, you had really solid strong growth in consumables on the dental side and then your equipment sales down for all the reasons we talked about and to normalize that. I wonder, though, in the quarter, does that dynamic -- is it enough on the product mix shift you saw to have an impact on the margin? Is that part of why the margins showed the improvement that they did in Dental?Kevin Barry: A.J., yes, it is. I mean we see typically within our dental business, our consumables margins and our value-added services margins, gross margins are higher than our equipment gross margins. Now they're somewhat interrelated, I'd say, because when we look at equipment, we also think about all the services that we provide with regard to the equipment that actually shows up on our value-added services. So in a quarter where we have slightly lower equipment sales that quarter, we might see a little bit of a mix benefit. But we know in our model, it accrues to mix benefits going forward when we sell a lot of equipment because we get the failure add services. We get the technical service revenue from that relationship.A.J. Rice: Okay. The company continues to put in its press release, the non to uncertain macro backdrop and some inflationary pressures we've talked on the call already about inflation impact or deflation impact in our infection control. And you've said you don't think you're seeing any impact on the equipment sales. Are you just making those statements to sort of keep a cautionary tone on things? Or is there any place that hasn't come up where those two dynamics, uncertain macroeconomic and inflationaries or pressures you are having an impact now that you would want to call out?Don Zurbay: No. I think we're putting that out there as just sort of a caution that kind of that these forces are out there and we have a lot of ways that we're looking at whether those are impacting our business and looking forward, do we think they're going to, and we're not seeing that. I think, again, I go back to -- I've been out in the field, I've been with our top salespeople recently. And I'd just tell you that the momentum in the business right now, the optimism momentum are extremely high and they're just not seeing it. So we'll continue to monitor it. And I think we want to put that out there just so -- I mean, not that people don't, but so people keep that in mind, but it's not showing up.A.J. Rice: It sounds like -- to an earlier question, when you think about the outlaying out the rest of the year, it doesn't sound like you're taking -- you're making any adjustments that things get tougher in any particular area, because of these factors late in the year. I just want to confirm that the variation that would be there is more, because of the year-to-year comps, et cetera, not so much because you're making an assumption about the macro environment changing. Is that right?Kevin Barry: That's right. Absolutely.A.J. Rice: Alright. Thanks a lot.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is open.Allen Lutz: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question from earlier. So over the past six months, equipment sales have been about 8%, and that's higher than what it's been over the past eight quarters. And so as we think about what we've seen so far on interest rates, you've said there's been a marginal impact. As you think about the guide for the remaining three quarters of the year, is there any expected incremental impact from higher interest rates? And then kind of more thematically in longer term, is there any way to think about how dentists react if interest rates stay higher for maybe a few quarters? Thanks.Don Zurbay: Well, I would say, first, the concept of any kind of marginal impact on the equivalent business, given interest rates is something that we spent a lot of time modeling is all really built into our guidance. So I think it would -- unless there's a fairly dramatic change there that we built some of that into our guidance and that's there. What was the second part of the question?Allen Lutz: Just how dentists would -- historically, how they react if interest rates stay higher for longer. We haven't really seen an environment where rates have been elevated for more than a few quarters. So just curious about your perspective there? Thanks.Don Zurbay: Yes. Well, again, what we keep seeing, and it's not just in the numbers, it's really just as we interact with our customers that there's a lot of interest in continued investment in the practice. We'll monitor that. I mean, I think if we start to see something happen there that changes that dynamic, then we'll build that into the expectations. But again, for right now, that's just -- again, there's a lot of interest in investment.Allen Lutz: Great. Thank you.Operator: And your final question today comes from the line of John Stansell from JPMorgan. Your line is open.John Stansell: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to look into production a little bit more. I think you -- appreciate you called out the headwind around cattle. So how does that sequential decline in herd count kind of translate to traffic? And then when you're having conversations with customers, how are you thinking about this? Is this something you see as kind of persistent through the year or more of a kind of a near-term? Thanks.Kevin Barry: Yes. So certainly, our customers are seeing those lower herd counts on the cattle business, and I'd say our production team is doing a fantastic job managing through that. I think the thing for our business is that we do have a diverse kind of portfolio of customers and species that we serve. We've got a large cattle business, but we also serve the swine market, the dairy markets. And so as we look at our business, even if one of those markets is relatively down, we see strength like we did in this quarter in the swine market, the dairy markets have come back. So we'll be able to kind of manage through with our portfolio. And so if there's a bit of a headwind here in one for a couple of quarters as those herd counts normalize, we're confident we've got the plan to manage through it.John Stansell: Great. And then just quickly on working capital. I think you called out that it improved in the quarter. Is there anything specifically that you're doing to drive this working capital improvement?Kevin Barry: Yes. No, the team did a good job this quarter. I think we're at a place with our working capital, I'd say that we're always looking for the right opportunities to make sure we've got the right inventory levels. We're balancing our service levels with good -- not getting too long on certain inventory categories. So I'd say there's opportunities that we look at more kind of opportunistically on the margins. But I'd just say, this quarter, our receivables team is doing a really good job. And I think as we go through the year, we'll continue to find some price some opportunities to take inventory down a bit, balancing that need to service the demand we've seen.John Stansell: Great. Thank you.Operator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Don Zurbay, for some final closing remarks.Don Zurbay: Just want to thank everybody for their time today and their interest in Patterson Companies, and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you.Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

In addition, dividend boosts help send a positive message surrounding the long-term picture of the company, instilling confidence it can withstand near-term uncertainties or challenges.Interestingly enough, three companies – Vistra VST, American Homes 4 Rent AMH, and Masco MAS – have all grown their dividend payouts nicely over the years. Further, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating optimism among analysts.For those seeking dividend-growers, let’s take a closer look at each.Vistra Corp. Vistra is a holding company that engages in the provision of electricity and power generation. The stock sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations creeping higher across nearly all timeframes.VST shares yield a solid 2.6% annually, with a payout ratio of 56% of the company’s earnings. The company has upped its dividend payout an impressive ten times over the last five years, translating to a 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has significant growth expectations, with Zacks Consensus Estimates suggesting 200% higher earnings on nearly 50% higher sales in its current year. The growth is slated to continue, as estimates allude to a further 40% earnings bump on 7% improved sales in FY24.Vistra posted results nicely above expectations in its latest release, causing shares to see bullish activity post-earnings. VST exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 25% and reported revenue 15% ahead of expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Homes 4 RentAmerican Homes 4 Rent, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an internally managed real estate investment trust focused on acquiring, renovating, leasing, and operating single-family homes as rental properties.

While the present yield may be a tad underwhelming, the company’s 28% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineEverybody loves dividends.

150,e5f4c288-5e6f-3551-9d45-6d86672ec1c3,MA,2023-09-01,Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-growth-stocks-top-030336914.html,1693537416,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'INTU', 'AMT', 'MRK', 'ZS', 'MA', 'SPLK', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Goldman Sachs' top 12 growth stock picks. If you want to skip the latest about one of America's most well known banks, then head on over to Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is making a lot of headlines these days, and not all of these are good. There's turmoil brewing within its walls and its chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon has continued to come under fire from a lot of quarters. 2022 wasn't kind to Goldman, as its revenue and net income dropped annually in the wake of the Federal Reserve's historic interest rate hikes. The bank's revenue for the 12 months ending in December last year stood at $47 billion and marked a sizeable drop of $12 billion. Similarly, its net income also dropped by $10 billion. This necessitated the bank to make some hard changes, one of which was reducing employee compensation.As you'd likely know if you've been reading Insider Monkey regularly, last year wasn't great for anyone who isn't a multi millionaire or a billionaire. Inflation touched a record high and right during this time, Goldman Sachs' employees also saw their compensation go down - a decision that didn't win Mr. Solomon any fans. At the center of this turmoil is the bank's much hyped Marcus division, which would provide loans to consumers and accept deposits. Goldman's reputation on Wall Street helped with the product launch and the bank soon attracted billions of dollars in deposits. It slowly expanded Marcus to include investment management and advising services. However, this is where the bank made mistakes, as it relied too much on its experience with high net worth individuals to develop profitability models for the Marcus investment division.Another mistake during this time period was Goldman's acquisition of GreenSky, a buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform. GreenSky is reported to be making hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, adding further to Mr. Solomon's woes. Seems like the Goldman boss really can't do anything right as far as sentiment in some quarters is concerned, with layoffs, Marcus, and GreenSky all heating up the pot against him.Story continuesBut wait, there's more. A big announcement that was also part of Goldman's push into the consumer world is its partnership with the Cupertino, California consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The pair partnered up in 2019 to provide the Apple Card platform, which allowed Apple customers to open savings accounts and conduct other financial actions. However, Goldman has lost billions of dollars from Apple Card, and most of these are believed to come from consumer disputes that have proven to be a bit too much for the investment bank to handle. With Apple Card's losses believed to sit at $5 billion as of late 2023, Mr. Solomon extended the partnership with Apple until 2029 in October 2022, so perhaps some of the ire directed at him does make some sense.Being on the back foot isn't great, and with August coming to an end, Goldman announced that it is selling its Personal Finance Management (PFM) business division. PFM was a wealth management unit that managed millionaires' money and Goldman's shares gained a couple of dollars on the market when the sale was announced. Year to date though the stock is down 5.35% and represents a cyclical roller coaster track that shows an inherent conflict in investors' minds when it comes to betting about the bank's future.Thought the bank's troubles were over? Think again as the Financial Times reports that the Federal Reserve has warned Goldman about its business dealings with financial technology and payments firms such as Stripe and Wise.However, even though it might very well be the case that someone has hexed Goldman Sachs, the fact still remains that its research division is one of the most credible in the world. An analyst's true test comes when he or she stands against the tide, and Goldman has been one of the very, very few in the industry that has been skeptical of a deep recession in the U.S. So, its stock picks still merit a deeper look and today we'll analyze some growth stocks. As a primer, growth stocks are those whose share price diverges significantly from the earnings per share, and if you're wondering why that is, check out 10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Universities for Learning Crypto and Blockchain Technology.Blockchain and Crypto: An OverviewIn the era of rapid technological advancement, blockchain and cryptocurrency are among the cutting-edge technologies that have grasped global attention. Blockchains are used to maintain a decentralized, transparent, immutable, and secure record of transactions. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global blockchain technology market was valued at $17.46 billion in 2023. The industry is expected to reach $1.43 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 87.7%. In 2022, North America accounted for 37% of the global blockchain industry revenue. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the fastest growth rate over the forecast period. The growing acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency, the rising popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are fueling the growth of blockchain. Blockchain technology is poised to disrupt various industries, including healthcare, supply chain, manufacturing, and financial services. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a giant in the beauty industry, has been using blockchain to track various components in its supply chain since 2020. The company uses blockchain to track ingredients vulnerable to environmental or labor inconsistencies. Aveda, a brand by the Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), uses blockchain to keep track of their Madagascan vanilla supply. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) has partnered with Wholechain to ensure visibility in the entire supply chain while also enabling stakeholders to check the ingredients' quality. Mediledger Network, administered by Chronicled, uses blockchain in healthcare to curb counterfeit medicine. Mediledger Network works with many pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Genentech. It uses blockchain to validate the authenticity of a drug through the supply chain. It also allows healthcare organizations to process large amounts of product-related data.Story continuesCompanies are also using blockchains to enhance their customer experience. In December 2021, Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) acquired RTKFT. The virtual clothing startup enabled Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to launch Cryptokicks, allowing collectors to own digital along with physical versions of their shoes. The digital versions can be worn in Nikeland in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) metaverse. Cryptokicks ""forges"" NFTs to its shoes by fitting each pair with a tiny chip linked to a blockchain. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also started using decentralized digital identities rooted in blockchain to transform its traditional loyalty program system. Swoosh, a platform by Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), allows users to co-create virtual products. This gamified loyalty program uses blockchain to maintain a transparent and secure record of customer activities. While blockchain has utility outside of cryptocurrencies, its most prominent use case is digital currencies. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $5.15 billion in 2023 and has been projected to grow to $11.71 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12.5%. Despite having a turbulent year in 2022, cryptocurrency has managed to stay relevant in the current financial world. Some of the most prominent companies working on blockchain and cryptocurrency include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). On August 7, Reuters reported that Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first major fintech companies to embrace digital currency by launching a US dollar-based stablecoin. This launch has helped restore some of the confidence lost in cryptocurrency because of several high-profile collapses and strict regulations being imposed.However, cryptocurrency is not out of turmoil yet. On August 25, Reuters reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Binance, a crypto exchange platform, will end their four crypto card programs by mid-September in four countries including Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia, and Brazil. Neither Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) nor Binance has publicly disclosed the reason for the termination of the programs. However, it could have been done in the wake of US lawsuits against Binance filed in June. Blockchain and the Financial Services SectorAccording to the report by Grand View Research, in 2022, the financial services sector had the biggest share of the global blockchain revenue, 37%. Blockchains have the potential to transform how the future of traditional financial institutions would look. Transactions on Wall Street are marked by the involvement of a third party like brokers and market makers which slows things down. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. This shift could transform the entire process, making it more streamlined and efficient. The financial services sector is experiencing an insidious but profound change, slowly transitioning into a future intertwined with blockchain. In November 2022, according to an article by Blockworks, Onyxx by JPMorgan, a bank-led blockchain platform, ran its first decentralized finance transaction on a public blockchain, using Ethereum to exchange Japanese yen for Singaporean dollars. The successful tokenization experiment was a monumental step for DeFi. Umer Farooq, the CEO of Onyx JPMorgan, commented on the potential of blockchain in Wall Street saying:""We have always believed that this technology has the ability to really revolutionize and rewrite financial market infrastructure whether that infrastructure is to move money, securities, or any other kind of assets. So despite all the ups and downs of prices and crypto and all that, I think we've been pretty consistent that the technology itself has a lot of power to rethink financial infrastructure.""On June 5, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan has introduced a blockchain-based platform to settle interbank dollar transactions among six banks in India. This platform would support New Delhi's attempt to push GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) forward. The blockchain-based platform is expected to ease the time required for settlements greatly and would be available around the clock. Blockchains are innately transparent and cut down the need for intermediaries. Tokenization has been gaining popularity worldwide; however, it is important to note that it is not a cure-all. The CNBC article highlighted that implementing tokenization and blockchain would solve only a segment of problems that financial institutions face today, and the transformation could be slow. However, blockchain technology is poised to be a significant part of the financial sector in the future. Many formal education institutions have already gauged the incoming digital revolution and are equipping their students with the knowledge to participate fully in this transformation.

V and Mastercard Incorporated MA, intend to hike credit card fees paid by merchants when they accept cards from customers, per the Wall Street Journal. The fee hikes are expected to materialize in October and April, per the report.Most of the increases are related to online purchases. CMSPI, a consulting firm, told the Wall Street Journal that the new fee structure will likely cost merchants an extra $502 million per annum. While more than half of that amount will likely come from network charges, interchange fees — commonly known as swipe fees — will provide the rest, per the merchant consulting firm.With the rapid expansion of e-commerce and digital transactions, these fee hikes are bound to rake in more revenues for Visa and Mastercard. A significant portion of these fees will likely be passed on to consumers through price hikes. While the network charges go to the card companies, the swipe fees are received by the banks, according to the Journal.Last year alone, U.S. merchants paid about $93 billion to Visa and Mastercard in credit-card fees, per Nilson Report. The figure surged from $33 billion in 2012.But there is resistance.The Credit Card Competition Act, a bipartisan bill, was reintroduced in both the House and the Senate in June with additional co-sponsors. The proposed measure is expected to increase competition through the usage of alternative credit card processing networks. This will likely increase the decision-making power of the merchants.Also, V and MA were facing an antitrust lawsuit filed with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Block, Inc. SQ in July. The operator of payments platform Square, Block, claimed that the payment technology giants conspired to inflate interchange fees and reduce competition.Nevertheless, Visa and Mastercard argue that the fees are utilized to offset the cost of fraud prevention and increase security and innovation. Also, a chunk of the money goes to credit-card rewards programs. The companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.While the fee hikes can increase revenues for these payment companies, it can affect small businesses that are dealing with inflationary woes and a high interest rate environment. The situation can push toward more payments with cash and debit. With small businesses offering incentives to consumers for paying in cash to avoid paying the fees, the digital payments growth rate will likely be impacted.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

154,0282c21e-7622-329f-98b2-18017c8856a6,QCOM,2023-09-01,QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-trending-stock-130010123.html,1693486810,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Qualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -12.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $1.91 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -39%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.31 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -33.7%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.13 indicates a change of +9.9% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $8.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.3%. The $35.69 billion and $37.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.3% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $8.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.7%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $2.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.31%.Over the last four quarters, Qualcomm surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: PHM), one of the largest home construction firms in the U.S., is once again entangled in a serious legal matter, this time involving allegations of gender discrimination and retaliation.The Lawsuit In Question: Last Wednesday, Caitlin Overturf filed a lawsuit against PulteGroup, alleging violations of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Florida Civil Rights Act (FCRA).Overturf, who worked as a Customer Care Manager II for the company until Oct. 2022, claims that despite her high performance reviews and ranking within the company, she was systematically discriminated against due to her sex.The lawsuit accuses PulteGroup of passing Overturf over for promotions in favor of less-qualified male colleagues and subjecting her to unmanageable workloads without assistance. The suit further alleges that Overturf was placed on an unwarranted Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in Sept. 2022, just a month before her eventual ""unlawful constructive termination.""This isn't the first time PulteGroup has faced serious allegations. Just last month, the company was sued for racial discrimination in Michigan by Ryan Adams, a former employee. In that case, Adams contended that he was unfairly dismissed and subjected to a hostile work environment due to his race.While the two lawsuits tackle different issues — race and gender — they both imply a concerning pattern of discrimination and call into question the company's internal culture. Could the new lawsuit indicate a broader problem within PulteGroup's corporate hierarchy?The Retaliation Factor: Notably, Overturf's lawsuit also claims retaliation, alleging that PulteGroup attempted to blacklist her from future employment opportunities.After resigning from PulteGroup, Overturf was offered a position with Randall Interior Finishes. However, that offer was rescinded following threats from PulteGroup to cancel contracts with Randall Interior Finishes if they went ahead with the hiring, according to the complaint.Story continuesRead also: Share Sales, Harassment Allegations And Power Play: Turbulence Hits PulteGroupLegal Ramifications: The lawsuit consists of four counts: two for violation of the FCRA (discrimination and retaliation) and two for violation of Title VII (sex discrimination and retaliation).Overturf is demanding a jury trial for all issues and seeks damages.As legal proceedings unfold, PulteGroup finds itself at a crossroads that may require significant introspection and reform should the allegations prove true.Benzinga reached out to PulteGroup for comment.Read next: PulteGroup Faces Severe Allegations Of Racial Discrimination In Michigan LawsuitDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential ...,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-international-bax-too-good-163248514.html,1693499568,STORY,['BAX'],"[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX). The stock, currently priced at 41.12, recorded a loss of 1.34% in a day and a 3-month increase of 2.79%. The stock's fair valuation is $95.04, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BAX. Click here to check it out. BAX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAXThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Is Baxter International (BAX) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Baxter International should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.62. These indicators suggest that Baxter International, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Altman Z-scoreInvented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company IntroductionBaxter offers a variety of medical instruments and supplies to caregivers. It enhanced its portfolio of hospital-focused offerings by acquiring Hillrom in late 2021. Legacy Baxter offers tools to help patients with acute and chronic kidney failure. It also sells a variety of injectable therapies for use in care settings, such as IV pumps, administrative sets, and solutions; nutritional products; and surgical sealants and hemostatic agents.Story continuesIs Baxter International (BAX) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down Baxter International's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Baxter International's Altman Z-score reveals that the company's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Baxter International's historical data, 2021: 0.85; 2022: 0.54; 2023: 0.49, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Baxter International's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Baxter International's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.04; 2023: -0.09) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Baxter International might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Baxter International is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.62; 2022: 0.51; 2023: 0.52 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Baxter International's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Conclusion: Baxter International - A Value Trap?Given the analysis above, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) appears to be a potential value trap. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the company's low Altman Z-score and declining operational efficiency suggest potential financial distress and underperformance. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in Baxter International.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best September Dividend Stocks To Buy.Dividend investing is a popular way to increase your earnings and generate income through investments. While it might appear straightforward to invest in stocks that pay dividends, this strategy actually involves various other aspects to consider. One approach within dividend investing is the dividend capture strategy. It involves buying a stock just before its ex-dividend date and then selling it shortly after, once the dividend has been paid. The goal is to capture the dividend payout without necessarily holding onto the stock for the long term.Investors who prefer a more active approach might find the dividend capture strategy suitable, as it involves relatively short holding periods. This can be appealing to those who don't want to commit to long-term investments. However, dividend investing offers benefits in the long run as they have the potential for capital appreciation over time. Dividends have contributed significantly to the market’s overall returns. A study by Hartford Funds revealed that from 1930 to 2019, dividends on average made up about 42% of the total returns each year. This is a yearly average of 1.8%.Another report by Wisdom Tree also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the past. According to the report, dividends played a substantial role in the S&amp;P 500's annual total returns of 10.4%, contributing almost 30%. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade when the S&amp;P 500 had negative overall returns. During this time, dividend returns of around 2% acted as a buffer, helping to counterbalance the negative price returns caused by the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis.When investing in dividend stocks, companies that regularly grow their dividends remain on investors’ radars. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks in this regard as these companies have a history of steadily raising their dividend payments for many years.Story continues10 Best September Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list presents the dividend capture strategy for choosing prominent dividend stocks scheduled to go ex-dividend in September 2023.

165,e46a2f11-27e0-318d-9965-21146f938134,JNJ,2023-09-01,25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-countries-worst-healthcare-system-165406868.html,1693500846,STORY,"['JNJ', 'PFE', 'ABT']","[In this article, we will determine which countries have the worst healthcare systems in the world and delve into the implications of challenges in this sector. If you wish to see the list directly, head to 8 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System.Despite the surge of healthcare innovations in this era, it's disheartening to witness the vast disparities in healthcare quality among countries. Several nations suffer from inefficient and inaccessible healthcare systems. These inadequacies, beyond the immediate public health implications, can have detrimental effects on national economies. Countries like the Central African Republic, Chad, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Haiti, and others consistently find themselves at the bottom of global healthcare rankings. In these nations, healthcare system issues arise from inadequate infrastructure, insufficient training for medical and paramedic staff, constrained budgets, and inadequate care for newborns and mothers, among other challenges. On the topic of newborn care, we have previously discussed the 20 Countries with the Highest Rates of Infant Mortality; you can read our article to find out where infants face the greatest risk.It's worth noting that countries with the worst healthcare systems not only represent a health crisis but also economic challenges. For instance, unhealthy workers tend to be less efficient and take more sick days, thereby reducing national productivity. Another consequence of a fragile healthcare system is brain drain; medical professionals from these countries often search for better opportunities abroad, causing an alarming talent drain in the home country, further worsening the situation. For example, a survey conducted by the Pakistan Journal Of Medical Sciences found that 33.3% of fresh medical graduates plan to leave Pakistan and settle abroad because of long working hours and poor pay. A subpar healthcare system can also dissuade foreign investors who may be concerned about the health of the workforce and potential medical costs. Considering the impact of weak healthcare systems on tourism and associated revenue, countries with persistent public health issues, especially contagious diseases, invariably witness a decline in tourism. For instance, following the first report of the Ebola virus in 2013, by August 2014, nearly half of the monthly flights scheduled to Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone were canceled, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.Story continuesLogically, countries grappling with healthcare crises could look to emulate the systems of the 15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The World. But since most countries with the worst healthcare system are least developed and heavily indebted, budget allocations to the healthcare sector and policy reforms hinder this development. Companies' Ability to Innovate Healthcare For Poorer CountriesGlobal pharmaceutical and healthcare behemoths like Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Abbott (NYSE:ABT) possess the resources, expertise, and networks to revolutionize healthcare in impoverished nations. For example, given the larger populations and often a higher prevalence of certain diseases in less affluent countries, these companies can offer volume-based discounts. In this aspect, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) has already committed to selling 23 patented drugs, including Comirnaty (their COVID-19 vaccine), to 45 underprivileged countries on a not-for-profit basis.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also continues to report strong performance of its core drugs along with the COVID-19 vaccine, which has been shipped to over 181 countries since December 2020. Similarly, another pharmaceutical giant, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), operates in over 160 countries, and the company's motto for 2030 is to enhance the lives of one in every three individuals, i.e., 3 billion people a year. Intriguingly, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)'s diagnostic kits for the virus witnessed skyrocketing sales. In the first quarter of 2021, COVID-19 diagnostic-testing sales accounted for $2.2 billion of the company's total $10.5 billion in sales.Diseases and health issues that predominantly plague poorer countries often don't attract ample research attention due to potentially unprofitable markets. To address this and aid these nations, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) pledged $30 million in 2014 to enhance newborn health and boost survival rates until 2020. This commitment supported initiatives in 20 countries with high neonatal mortality rates, including Nigeria and Ethiopia. Furthermore, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) collaborated with Save the Children to offer newborn resuscitation and other vital services to approximately one million children globally.Now, let's turn our attention to countries with the worst healthcare systems.25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare SystemOur MethodologyWe shortlisted countries with the worst healthcare systems in the world based on three metrics: First, we selected the 25 lowest-ranking countries from the health pillar of the Legatum Prosperity Index. This index measures the extent to which people in over 167 countries are healthy and have access to necessary healthcare services. Next, we referred to the Global Health Index 2021. This index, developed in partnership between the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, analyzes countries' preparedness to handle situations like COVID-19 and the general healthcare access their populations enjoy. The Global Health Index categorizes countries into 5 tiers based on their ability to handle disease outbreaks. The tiers' are:Tier 1 = 0-20Tier 2 = 20.1-40Tier 3 = 40.1-60Tier 4 = 60.1-80Tier 5 = 80.1-100Countries falling in tier 5 are supposed to have the best healthcare system, while those in the 1st tier are the worst in terms of healthcare provision. The index noted that none of the countries managed to be in the 5th tier, and the average score for over 190 countries was 38.5 out of 100. Any country with a score below 38.5 is in the alarming zone and does not have enough resources in the healthcare sector.Lastly, and most importantly, we identified countries with the lowest life expectancy from the World Bank Database, as this metric indicates how effectively a country manages chronic and infectious diseases. To develop a scoring system for these countries, we used the weighted averaging method. We assigned a weight of 0.4 to life expectancy, 0.3 to the health pillar of the Legatum Prosperity Index, and 0.3 to the Global Health Index. Notably, the country with the lowest score on our list has the worst healthcare system in the world. We then listed these nations in descending order based on their healthcare systems.Based on our findings, here are the 25 countries with the worst healthcare systems:25. MadagascarInsider Monkey Score: 22.2In 2023, Madagascar has a population of nearly 30 million and a GDP of $15 billion. Almost two-thirds of the country's population lives below the poverty line, lacking enough capital to spend on adequate healthcare. The healthcare system in Madagascar is highly underfunded due to a lack of infrastructure and insufficient qualified personnel. The majority of medical facilities are concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural inhabitants underserved. Poverty, limited government spending on health, and frequent natural disasters further hinder the country's ability to establish a reliable healthcare system.24. HaitiInsider Monkey Score: 20.8Healthcare in Haiti is characterized by a heavy reliance on international aid, as it is among the countries with the highest rates of poverty. Insufficient public funding and a shortage of healthcare professionals exacerbate the nation's situation. The 2010 earthquake destroyed much of Haiti's already fragile infrastructure. With 29.2% of the population living in extreme poverty, availing of sufficient healthcare becomes challenging.23. Republic Of CongoInsider Monkey Score: 18.8The Republic of Congo is one of the hungriest countries in the world due to its extreme poverty and poor administration. Currently, 35.4% of the country's population survives on less than $2.15 a day, and recurrent epidemics make life difficult for them. Although the government has made strides in improving healthcare, many regions remain underserved because of geographical barriers. Endemic diseases, such as yellow fever and malaria, place additional burdens on an already strained system.22. NigerInsider Monkey Score: 18.7In Niger, the current GDP is $16.617 billion, and over 50.6% of its population lives in extreme poverty. The country's healthcare system faces challenges like high infant and maternal mortality rates, which can be attributed to malnutrition, infectious diseases, and limited access to clean water and sanitation. Despite efforts, Niger lacks the medical facilities and trained professionals needed to cater to its growing population, especially since it ranks third among countries with the highest rates of population growth.21. Papua New GuineaInsider Monkey Score: 17.8Healthcare in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is challenged by rugged terrain, which impedes access to remote areas, and a shortage of qualified medical personnel. PNG contends with high rates of communicable diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. With almost 40% of the population living in extreme poverty, delivering uniform healthcare is complicated in PNG.20. AfghanistanInsider Monkey Score: 17.1Decades of conflict has severely impacted Afghanistan's healthcare system, which has a current score of 28.8 (out of 100), according to the Global Health Index. Additionally, nearly half the people in Afghanistan grapple with severe economic challenges, leading to poor health outcomes and a high mortality rate. The country's per capita GDP is $363, making it the seventh hungriest country in the world.19. MozambiqueInsider Monkey Score: 16.8Mozambique suffers from a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, and its heavy reliance on foreign aid results in a high burden of diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. Frequent natural disasters and a significant disease burden strain the country's fragile system. The Borgen Project reports that many people in rural Mozambique remain impoverished and are consequently cut off from the healthcare system.18. LiberiaInsider Monkey Score: 16.8Liberia's healthcare system suffered immensely due to a 14-year civil war, which devastated infrastructure and resulted in a significant exodus of medical professionals. The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak further exposed the system's weaknesses, including a lack of isolation units and trained personnel. Rebuilding and fortifying the health system is a priority in Liberia. However, with poverty being a significant concern, the government's spending on the healthcare sector is only 9.5% of its $3.5 billion GDP.17. AngolaInsider Monkey Score: 15.8Angola allocates 2.9% of its $67 billion GDP to the healthcare sector, earning it a score of 29.1 out of 100 on the Global Health Index. Despite the country's oil wealth, there is a troubling disparity in healthcare access. While urban areas are better equipped, rural regions are often neglected. Diseases like malaria, yellow fever, and cholera are prevalent in Angola, adding more pressure to its already strained healthcare system.16. MaliInsider Monkey Score: 15.7Mali's current GDP stands at approximately $19.14 billion, with 4.31% dedicated to the healthcare sector. The country grapples with a high incidence of diseases like schistosomiasis, malaria, and malnutrition, which demand more resources. Financial barriers often deter many from seeking treatment, especially considering that nearly 15% of the population lives in extreme poverty.15. Côte D'IvoireInsider Monkey Score: 14.9Côte D'Ivoire's healthcare system is heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS and malaria. Insufficient funds (the country spends 3.72% of its $70 billion GDP on healthcare) and a shortage of trained professionals exacerbate the problems in its healthcare system. While urban centers like Abidjan offer adequate medical facilities, rural areas lag behind. Past political instability and civil conflicts have further constrained government healthcare expenditure.14. CameroonInsider Monkey Score: 14.8Cameroon is among the countries with bad healthcare. Cameroon's GDP is nearly $45 billion, with 3.77% dedicated to healthcare. According to the Global Health Index, Cameroon scored 28.6 out of 100 and secured 149th rank out of 190 countries in terms of disease management capacity. The country boasts a diverse health infrastructure that includes public, private, and traditional sectors. However, resource constraints and mismanagement are prevalent issues.13. Sierra LeoneInsider Monkey Score: 14.3Sierra Leone faces an extreme poverty rate of 26.1%, and its Global Health Index score is 32.7. The country's health system is still rebounding from the aftershocks of its civil war and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. These calamities severely impacted the already fragile healthcare infrastructure, resulting in an overburdened workforce. Additionally, Sierra Leone contends with some of the world's highest child mortality rates, registering 72.3 deaths per 1000 live births.12. BeninInsider Monkey Score: 13.9In Benin, the healthcare sector expenditure is 2.59% of its GDP, indicating limited resources. Another challenge pushing Benin among countries with struggling healthcare systems is the inadequate training of health workers. Although healthcare is nominally free for children under five and pregnant women, many still incur out-of-pocket expenses.11. NigeriaInsider Monkey Score: 11.6Nigeria is one of the countries with the worst healthcare in the world. It struggles with looming poverty and unemployment, which adversely impact public health. The country designates 3.38% of its GDP to healthcare. However, despite its substantial economic resources, corruption, underfunding, and a lack of infrastructure hamper Nigeria's healthcare system.10. Democratic Republic Of CongoInsider Monkey Score: 11.3In DR Congo, 60% of the population lives on less than $2.15 a day, making out-of-pocket health expenses prohibitive for many. The country's healthcare system struggles due to prolonged conflict, manifesting in a severe shortage of infrastructure, resources, and trained staff. DR Congo's Global Health Index score stands at 26.1, and the nation allocates 4.05% of its GDP to health.9. Equatorial GuineaInsider Monkey Score: 11Equatorial Guinea's health system remains under-resourced and inefficient despite its oil wealth. A stark disparity exists between the healthcare quality available to the elite and the broader population. Endemic diseases, particularly malaria, further strain the country's healthcare system.Click to continue reading 8 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System.Suggested Articles:10 Healthcare Stocks with Insider Buying15 Worst Performing Healthcare Stocks in 202315 European Countries with Best Healthcare for ExpatsDisclosure: None. 25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System was originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

X/Twitter users were quick to point out the hypocrisy of the post, saying the drug companies are also single entities that arbitrarily set medicine prices.""As opposed to the current system, where you arbitrarily set medicine prices high enough to satisfy your shareholders and pay your CEOs obscene salaries?"" wrote @joekatz45.Another user, @DrMattDSW, wrote, ""lmao when did we ever have input into our (outrageously expensive) Rx prices? Never. We’ve never had input. And considering how much research is funded by the government (which means through our tax dollars) I am more than okay with lower prices for everyone. Get bent.""What @WhiteHouse isn't telling you: They're giving a single government agency power to arbitrarily set medicine prices with little accountability, oversight or input from patients &amp; their doctors—with consequences long after this administration is gone. https://t.co/t5UeVnWftr https://t.co/YnGpmUUDl4— PhRMA (@PhRMA) August 29, 2023Yahoo Finance spoke with a half-dozen health policy experts about the backlash, which continued to escalate late Wednesday — more than 24 hours after the post was published.Story continuesAndrew Mulcahy, senior health economist at The RAND Corporation, said the tweet was a little off-target — especially in claiming that the government was arbitrarily setting prices without input from patients and doctors.""Congress was very specific in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. There is a very long guidance document that HHS [Health and Human Services] put out that got commented on, and revised. It's hard to say that they're doing it without patients and doctors,"" Mulcahey said.Anna Kaltenboeck, a former senior health adviser on the Senate Finance Committee who helped write the IRA, reposted the tweet from PhRMA and ""fixed"" it to reflect support for the law.""They are railing against a policy that more than 80% of Americans agree with ... that's both Democrats and Republicans. So if you have that level of unity on an issue and we are this divided as a country, on a partisan basis, that tells you something,"" Kaltenboeck, principal and head of drug reimbursement at healthcare research firm ATI Advisory, told Yahoo Finance.Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said the social media post was a sign of how aggressively the industry is fighting negotiations.""The fact that the drug industry is continuing to fight this shows they’re worried that it’s a foot in the door for broader government price-setting powers. I have to believe PhRMA is hoping for a Republican sweep in 2024, with the potential to roll back or slow down price negotiation,"" Levitt said.Michael Sinha, assistant professor of law at St. Louis University of Law, agreed. He said that though the Congressional Budget Office estimates show low impact to innovation and drug R&amp;D, the industry is still looking to rally support to overturn the IRA if the upcoming election gives it a favorable political environment to do so.""PhRMA doesn’t want to go down without a fight. It is used to winning,"" he said.Legal battle aheadPharmaceutical companies have filed more than a half-dozen lawsuits in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected. The lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging the companies are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Sinha said the suits are ""bizarre"" and would set a dangerous precedent if the industry wins. KFF's Levitt said the outcome is still uncertain.""The pharmaceutical industry may yet be successful at using the courts to stop government negotiation of drug prices, but I think they're going to have a tough time winning over the public. Giving the government authority to negotiate drug prices in Medicare is enormously popular across partisan lines, and the public doesn't buy the arguments against it,"" Levitt added.The Biden Administration has similarly said it will be hard to put the cat back in the bag.""It's important to remember that basically what pharma is arguing in these court cases is that they should have no limit to be able to charge whatever they want, and that is exactly why Americans support Medicare drug negotiations,"" said Biden's domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden on Tuesday.Kaltenboeck said she is confident the law will stand up in court.""We tried our very best to make this thing as navigable as possible for all the stakeholders involved, and clear as possible,"" she said.Tanden noted that given that the negotiation process is happening publicly, with the prices published next September, it will be hard to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act — just as it has been to repeal the Affordable Care Act — and to ""claw back these benefits, these lower prices,"" Tanden said.A health economist, who was not authorized to speak to media, said there could be negative ramifications to the economics of drug research with this move by the administration.""Overall I find the whole discussion about this being 'popular' or 'polling well' a bit silly. Unsurprisingly, people like paying less for something. And we aren’t forcing people to consider that they are also going to pay for low prices today with fewer drugs in the future,"" the economist said.Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale University, said the lobbying firm's tweet showed how tone-deaf it was to the majority of public opinion.""Nearly 20 years ago, PhRMA pulled the biggest hoax on the American people in successfully lobbying Congress to not negotiate reasonable prices of drugs as almost every other similar country does. This is long overdue and this tweet and their lawsuits make clear that PhRMA continues to prioritize maximizing their profits instead of patient access,"" she said.Kaltenboeck added that the industry has no obligation to offer its products through Medicare, and has for too long been forcing Medicare to sell at whatever prices they set.""You don't have to sell your drugs to Medicare, there is no Constitutional obligation. So they are free to avoid the program,"" she said.PhRMA declined to comment.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

J&amp;J also updated its first-half financials.In May 2023, J&amp;J spun off its Consumer Health segment into a new listed company called Kenvue, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with effect from May 4. J&amp;J owned 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue’s common stock and was the majority shareholder. This month, J&amp;J made an exchange offer for shares of Kenvue that it owned to complete the separation. After completion of the exchange offer, J&amp;J now has a 9.5% stake (approximately 180 million shares) in Kenvue’s common stock, which it may monetize in a tax-efficient manner in 2024. J&amp;J generated $13.2 billion in cash proceeds following the Kenvue debt offering and initial public offering.With the complete separation of the Consumer Health segment, J&amp;J has become a two-sector company focused on the Pharmaceutical and MedTech fields. Kenvue will now operate as a separate and fully independent company.J&amp;J will present its Consumer Health business as discontinued operations in its financial statements, including a tax-free gain of approximately $20 billion in the third quarter of 2023J&amp;J’s stock has declined 7.3% so far this year against an increase of 8.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFollowing the separation of the Consumer Health unit, while J&amp;J lowered its earnings and sales guidance ranges on an absolute basis, it expects better growth rates than previously expected. The company also maintained its dividend.J&amp;J now expects revenues in the range of $83.2 billion-$84.0 billion compared with the earlier expectation of $98.8 billion to $99.8 billion. This new guidance excludes any revenues from the Consumer Health segment and now reflects sales from only the Pharmaceutical and MedTech units. Revenue growth is now expected in the range of 7%-8% compared with the prior expectation of 6.5%-7.5%. All revenue figures exclude any revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine sales.Story continuesOperational constant-currency sales are expected to increase in the range of 7.5%-8.5% compared with the prior expectation of 7%-8%. Adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth is now expected to be 6.2%-7.2% (prior expectation of 6%-7%).The adjusted earnings per share guidance was lowered from a range of $10.70-$10.80 to $10.00-$10.10.However, the earnings range implies growth in the range of 12%-13%, which is higher than the prior expectation of 5.5%-6.5%. On an operational, constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 11%-12% versus the prior expectation of 4.5%-5.5%.With the completion of the Kenvue exchange offer, the share count was lowered by 191 million shares or 24% of the shares of J&amp;J common stock that were tendered in exchange for approximately 1.5 billion shares of Kenvue common stock that J&amp;J owned. As a result, J&amp;J’s outstanding share count was reduced by approximately 7%.The updated adjusted EPS guidance for 2023 reflects only a partial-year benefit of approximately 73.5 million shares or 28 cents benefit out of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in J&amp;J shares outstanding from the exchange offer.Adjusted pretax operating margin is now expected to improve approximately 50 basis points from 2022 levels versus the prior expectation of a slight improvement, driven by a better margin profile and mix.Other income is expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion compared with the prior expectation of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion due to the de-consolidation of J&amp;J’s non-controlling interest in Kenvue. Net interest income is expected in the range of $100 to $200 million.Adjusted tax rate guidance was lowered from a range of 15.5% to 16.5% to 15.0%-16.0%. J&amp;J continues to expect to pay a dividend of $1.19 per share, which represents an annual yield of 2.9%.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderJ&amp;J has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Johnson &amp; Johnson Price and ConsensusJohnson &amp; Johnson Price and ConsensusJohnson &amp; Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson &amp; Johnson QuoteSome drug/biotech stocks worth considering are Alaunos Therapeutics TCRT and Corcept Therapeutics CORT, with the same Zacks Rank as J&amp;J.

To skip our detailed analysis of the stock portfolio performance of Fisher Asset Management and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Trust, you can go directly to see Billionaire Ken Fisher and Bill Gates Love These 4 Stocks.Learning how to invest in a volatile market like the one we're seeing in 2023 can be a challenging endeavor for most investors. This is why learning by example can be a good option for most, especially new, investors. Those who have managed to build sustainable and profitable stock portfolios over a prolonged period of time, such as Ken Fisher or Michael Larson on behalf of Bill Gates, can act as good examples to follow if you're a beginner investor who's just starting out and trying to figure out where to put your money. These individuals barely need any introduction because of their work in the investing community, but to put it briefly, Fisher is a renowned billionaire investor who founded Fisher Asset Management in 1979 and, since then, has set historical precedents in the world of investing with his outperformance of the broad US stock market for almost two decades. On the other hand, Michael Larson is the chief money manager for the billionaire founder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. Larson is considered to be the man behind Gates' ever-growing fortune. The stock portfolios managed by both of these investors are worth taking a good look at, considering their ample experience in the area and their sustained success.Fisher On Positioning Yourself For a Market ReboundA look at Fisher's investing history shows his sharp intuition and ability to prepare himself for market developments. Considering how the stock market has been seeing an August sell-off, one area investors might be confused about today is how they should prepare themselves for a market rebound after this sell-off, and Fisher has specific advice for just this question. This February, he explained how investors should position themselves for a new bull market after a tough cycle:Story continues""The categories that dropped the most in the bear market tend to bounce the most in, roughly, the first third of the next bull market, however long that subsequent bull market may last.""Fisher's analysis above was based on the market period between October 2022 and February 2023. He noted that in this time, things that ""fell the most"" were mostly growth stocks and tech stocks, while those that did well included energy stocks, for example. According to his analysis, energy stocks would end up doing poorly in the new bull market, while growth stocks and tech stocks would end up doing well. As we saw in June, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector was down by almost 10%, while the technology sector was outperforming the broader benchmark. Noting this state of the market, a few more of Fisher's comments become relevant:""Normal human instincts say, 'I wanna buy and own the things that didn't do badly in the bear market.' The fact of the matter is, those things that did well in the bear market, like energy, tend to do badly in the bounce.""Based on Fisher's advice, investors preparing for the market rebound after the August sell-off can perhaps benefit from keeping an eye on which stocks and sectors are doing well or doing poorly during this period in preparation for the eventual market rebound.Gates on AI and Clean EnergyWhile Fisher is offering updated advice on how to meticulously prepare yourself for shifting stock market trends, Gates is shedding some light on worthwhile areas of investment with his own focus on certain key fields. For instance, over the past several years, Gates has been heavily investing in clean energy generation, and he has also recently been discussing artificial intelligence and its potential to change the tech world forever. In 2015, Gates founded Breakthrough Energy, a company aiming to accelerate innovation in sustainable energy and other tech to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and their impact on the environment. Gates talked about this company with Morgan Stanley's Chief Equity Strategist in India, Ridham Desai, just this August. He noted that Breakthrough Energy is committed to developing technologies that can help developing countries focus on green energy efforts without having to pay a ""green premium,"" which is basically a higher cost for adhering to generally environmentally friendly alternatives in things like making steel and cement, for instance. The fact that it is more expensive for developing countries to adhere to climate-friendly options in certain industries makes it harder for them to take the green energy agenda forward, which is where Breakthrough Energy is supposed to come in, according to Gates.Apart from green energy, Gates is also showing immense interest in AI today, especially in OpenAI's ChatGPT, which he likened to the graphical user interface he was introduced to in 1980, which went on to become ""the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows."" In his blog post this March, Gates noted the immense potential of AI, stating further that the Gates Foundation would have ""much more to say about AI"" in the coming months"" to make it a technology that can benefit not just those who are well off, but all individuals equally.All in all, considering the opinions of renowned individuals in the investing and business communities today can be a vital exercise for beginner investors looking for investing advice. Gates and Fisher both have stellar portfolios made up of well-known names such as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), which are behind their wealth and fame. We have thus gone through Bill Gates' stock portfolio for 2023 alongside Fisher's portfolio to show which names they have in common as a starting point for new investors. This required us to take a look at Gates' and Fisher's most recent investments for the second quarter.Billionaire Ken Fisher and Bill Gates Love These 7 StocksOur MethodologyWe went through the updated second-quarter stock portfolios of Fisher Asset Management and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust to find stocks both portfolios had in common. We then ranked these stocks based on the combined stake value of both portfolios, from the lowest to the highest. We also mentioned Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter for each stock listed.Billionaire Ken Fisher and Bill Gates Love These Stocks7. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)Fisher Asset Management's Q2 2023 Stake: $96.6 millionBill &amp; Melinda Gates Trust's Q2 2023 Stake: $555.5 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is a consumer staples company that produces, distributes, markets, and sells beer and beverages. The company is based in Leuven, Belgium. It has a portfolio of about 500 beer brands, including Budweiser, Corona, and Stella Artois.On July 20, Sarah Simon, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, upgraded shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) from Equal Weight to Overweight. The analyst also raised her price target on the stock from $64 to $68.5.Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) was seen in the portfolios of 19 hedge funds in the second quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $292 million.Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest shareholder in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of the second quarter, holding 1.7 million shares.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comments about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”Like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is a stock Gates and Fisher have invested heavily in.6. Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)Fisher Asset Management's Q2 2023 Stake: $161.8 millionBill &amp; Melinda Gates Trust's Q2 2023 Stake: $543.9 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Marie Ferguson, an analyst at Argus Research, initiated coverage on shares of Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) with a Buy rating on August 2. The analyst also announced a price target of $140 on the stock.Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) is a telecom tower real estate investment trust company. It is based in Houston, Texas. The company owns, operates, and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and about 85,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions across major US markets.We saw 41 hedge funds holding stakes in Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) at the end of the second quarter, with a total stake value of $728 million.This is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners had to say about Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Crown Castle, the largest U.S. provider of shared communications infrastructure—cell towers, small cells and fiber—was the largest detractor from performance. The company reported a decline in fiber revenue and a deceleration in tower sales growth during the quarter after record network spending by wireless carriers in 2022 (related to the ongoing rollout of 5G). We continue to appreciate the benefits of management’s differentiated strategy to remain 100% focused on the U.S. while many competitors have instead sought to expand their tower businessesinternationally. We believe Crown Castle’s approach delivers a compelling value proposition as the company’s customers seek to utilize shared infrastructure while making multi‐ billion‐dollar investments in spectrum assets. Although carriers have generally pulled back from network spending this year, we continue to find the structure of Crown Castle’s tower business attractive. This includes the ability to implement a nearly 3% annual price escalator on tower rental rates, the low capital investment needed to maintain its towers and sticky customers with an over 95% renewal rate over the last 5 years. Looking past the short‐term movements in demand, we believe that, over the long term, the company is well‐poised to gain market share and also improve its profitability as it increases the average number of tenants per tower. In addition, management reiterated it is on pace to deploy 10,000 small cell nodes in 2023 (approximately doubling last year’s results). As such, we view Crown Castle as uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to 5G networks, since the company’s portfolio skews toward urban areas where densification of populations, infrastructure and networks enhances the value proposition of small cells.”5. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Fisher Asset Management's Q2 2023 Stake: $89.5 millionBill &amp; Melinda Gates Trust's Q2 2023 Stake: $983.5 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89In the second quarter, 89 hedge funds in total held stakes in Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Their total stake value in the company was $6.4 billion.Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a life sciences tools and services company that designs, manufactures, and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services across the globe. The company is based in Washington, the District of Columbia. It offers bioprocess technologies, consumables, and services, among more.Conor McNamara, an analyst at RBC Capital, maintains an Outperform rating on shares of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) as of July 26. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $260 to $292.Third Point Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is our longest held investment and remains a top five position. Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizeable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory de-stocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)Like Caterpillar Inc.

176,e5f4c288-5e6f-3551-9d45-6d86672ec1c3,MRK,2023-09-01,Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-growth-stocks-top-030336914.html,1693537416,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'INTU', 'AMT', 'MRK', 'ZS', 'MA', 'SPLK', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Goldman Sachs' top 12 growth stock picks. If you want to skip the latest about one of America's most well known banks, then head on over to Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is making a lot of headlines these days, and not all of these are good. There's turmoil brewing within its walls and its chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon has continued to come under fire from a lot of quarters. 2022 wasn't kind to Goldman, as its revenue and net income dropped annually in the wake of the Federal Reserve's historic interest rate hikes. The bank's revenue for the 12 months ending in December last year stood at $47 billion and marked a sizeable drop of $12 billion. Similarly, its net income also dropped by $10 billion. This necessitated the bank to make some hard changes, one of which was reducing employee compensation.As you'd likely know if you've been reading Insider Monkey regularly, last year wasn't great for anyone who isn't a multi millionaire or a billionaire. Inflation touched a record high and right during this time, Goldman Sachs' employees also saw their compensation go down - a decision that didn't win Mr. Solomon any fans. At the center of this turmoil is the bank's much hyped Marcus division, which would provide loans to consumers and accept deposits. Goldman's reputation on Wall Street helped with the product launch and the bank soon attracted billions of dollars in deposits. It slowly expanded Marcus to include investment management and advising services. However, this is where the bank made mistakes, as it relied too much on its experience with high net worth individuals to develop profitability models for the Marcus investment division.Another mistake during this time period was Goldman's acquisition of GreenSky, a buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform. GreenSky is reported to be making hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, adding further to Mr. Solomon's woes. Seems like the Goldman boss really can't do anything right as far as sentiment in some quarters is concerned, with layoffs, Marcus, and GreenSky all heating up the pot against him.Story continuesBut wait, there's more. A big announcement that was also part of Goldman's push into the consumer world is its partnership with the Cupertino, California consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The pair partnered up in 2019 to provide the Apple Card platform, which allowed Apple customers to open savings accounts and conduct other financial actions. However, Goldman has lost billions of dollars from Apple Card, and most of these are believed to come from consumer disputes that have proven to be a bit too much for the investment bank to handle. With Apple Card's losses believed to sit at $5 billion as of late 2023, Mr. Solomon extended the partnership with Apple until 2029 in October 2022, so perhaps some of the ire directed at him does make some sense.Being on the back foot isn't great, and with August coming to an end, Goldman announced that it is selling its Personal Finance Management (PFM) business division. PFM was a wealth management unit that managed millionaires' money and Goldman's shares gained a couple of dollars on the market when the sale was announced. Year to date though the stock is down 5.35% and represents a cyclical roller coaster track that shows an inherent conflict in investors' minds when it comes to betting about the bank's future.Thought the bank's troubles were over? Think again as the Financial Times reports that the Federal Reserve has warned Goldman about its business dealings with financial technology and payments firms such as Stripe and Wise.However, even though it might very well be the case that someone has hexed Goldman Sachs, the fact still remains that its research division is one of the most credible in the world. An analyst's true test comes when he or she stands against the tide, and Goldman has been one of the very, very few in the industry that has been skeptical of a deep recession in the U.S. So, its stock picks still merit a deeper look and today we'll analyze some growth stocks. As a primer, growth stocks are those whose share price diverges significantly from the earnings per share, and if you're wondering why that is, check out 10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now.

X/Twitter users were quick to point out the hypocrisy of the post, saying the drug companies are also single entities that arbitrarily set medicine prices.""As opposed to the current system, where you arbitrarily set medicine prices high enough to satisfy your shareholders and pay your CEOs obscene salaries?"" wrote @joekatz45.Another user, @DrMattDSW, wrote, ""lmao when did we ever have input into our (outrageously expensive) Rx prices? Never. We’ve never had input. And considering how much research is funded by the government (which means through our tax dollars) I am more than okay with lower prices for everyone. Get bent.""What @WhiteHouse isn't telling you: They're giving a single government agency power to arbitrarily set medicine prices with little accountability, oversight or input from patients &amp; their doctors—with consequences long after this administration is gone. https://t.co/t5UeVnWftr https://t.co/YnGpmUUDl4— PhRMA (@PhRMA) August 29, 2023Yahoo Finance spoke with a half-dozen health policy experts about the backlash, which continued to escalate late Wednesday — more than 24 hours after the post was published.Story continuesAndrew Mulcahy, senior health economist at The RAND Corporation, said the tweet was a little off-target — especially in claiming that the government was arbitrarily setting prices without input from patients and doctors.""Congress was very specific in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. There is a very long guidance document that HHS [Health and Human Services] put out that got commented on, and revised. It's hard to say that they're doing it without patients and doctors,"" Mulcahey said.Anna Kaltenboeck, a former senior health adviser on the Senate Finance Committee who helped write the IRA, reposted the tweet from PhRMA and ""fixed"" it to reflect support for the law.""They are railing against a policy that more than 80% of Americans agree with ... that's both Democrats and Republicans. So if you have that level of unity on an issue and we are this divided as a country, on a partisan basis, that tells you something,"" Kaltenboeck, principal and head of drug reimbursement at healthcare research firm ATI Advisory, told Yahoo Finance.Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said the social media post was a sign of how aggressively the industry is fighting negotiations.""The fact that the drug industry is continuing to fight this shows they’re worried that it’s a foot in the door for broader government price-setting powers. I have to believe PhRMA is hoping for a Republican sweep in 2024, with the potential to roll back or slow down price negotiation,"" Levitt said.Michael Sinha, assistant professor of law at St. Louis University of Law, agreed. He said that though the Congressional Budget Office estimates show low impact to innovation and drug R&amp;D, the industry is still looking to rally support to overturn the IRA if the upcoming election gives it a favorable political environment to do so.""PhRMA doesn’t want to go down without a fight. It is used to winning,"" he said.Legal battle aheadPharmaceutical companies have filed more than a half-dozen lawsuits in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected. The lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging the companies are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Sinha said the suits are ""bizarre"" and would set a dangerous precedent if the industry wins. KFF's Levitt said the outcome is still uncertain.""The pharmaceutical industry may yet be successful at using the courts to stop government negotiation of drug prices, but I think they're going to have a tough time winning over the public. Giving the government authority to negotiate drug prices in Medicare is enormously popular across partisan lines, and the public doesn't buy the arguments against it,"" Levitt added.The Biden Administration has similarly said it will be hard to put the cat back in the bag.""It's important to remember that basically what pharma is arguing in these court cases is that they should have no limit to be able to charge whatever they want, and that is exactly why Americans support Medicare drug negotiations,"" said Biden's domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden on Tuesday.Kaltenboeck said she is confident the law will stand up in court.""We tried our very best to make this thing as navigable as possible for all the stakeholders involved, and clear as possible,"" she said.Tanden noted that given that the negotiation process is happening publicly, with the prices published next September, it will be hard to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act — just as it has been to repeal the Affordable Care Act — and to ""claw back these benefits, these lower prices,"" Tanden said.A health economist, who was not authorized to speak to media, said there could be negative ramifications to the economics of drug research with this move by the administration.""Overall I find the whole discussion about this being 'popular' or 'polling well' a bit silly. Unsurprisingly, people like paying less for something. And we aren’t forcing people to consider that they are also going to pay for low prices today with fewer drugs in the future,"" the economist said.Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale University, said the lobbying firm's tweet showed how tone-deaf it was to the majority of public opinion.""Nearly 20 years ago, PhRMA pulled the biggest hoax on the American people in successfully lobbying Congress to not negotiate reasonable prices of drugs as almost every other similar country does. This is long overdue and this tweet and their lawsuits make clear that PhRMA continues to prioritize maximizing their profits instead of patient access,"" she said.Kaltenboeck added that the industry has no obligation to offer its products through Medicare, and has for too long been forcing Medicare to sell at whatever prices they set.""You don't have to sell your drugs to Medicare, there is no Constitutional obligation. So they are free to avoid the program,"" she said.PhRMA declined to comment.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase Mosaic's shares before the 6th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.80 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Mosaic has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current stock price of $38.85. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Mosaic has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Mosaic is paying out just 14% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 14% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that Mosaic's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Mosaic's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 56% per annum for the past five years. Mosaic looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Mosaic's dividend payments per share have declined at 2.2% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.Final TakeawayIs Mosaic worth buying for its dividend? It's great that Mosaic is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. There's a lot to like about Mosaic, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Mosaic for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Mosaic (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored).A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the top 10 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USA. On 21st July 2023, seven major tech giants, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pledged a ""voluntary commitment"" to collaborate with the Biden administration to mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Following a meeting with President Joe Biden, these companies agreed to focus on safety, security, and trust in AI development. This included subjecting AI systems to external testing for safety and capabilities, safeguarding against cyber and insider threats, and ensuring that AI does not promote bias or discrimination. How Real is the AI Hype?Whenever a new technology enters the market, investors deliberate its economic implications and its potential to augment corporate profits. The hype around Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has now gained significant momentum which can be realized by the fact that it has contributed to a surge of nearly 40% in the Nasdaq Composite, in the first half of 2023. While some analysts have coined this surge as an ""A.I. gold rush,"" there are contrasting perspectives. Some believe that investors might be preemptively optimistic about the valuation of A.I-related stocks. These cautious perspectives suggest that the anticipated A.I. boom might not unfold as projected, especially concerning stock market investors.However, the analysts at Goldman Sachs present a differing view, contending that the hype about A.I. is indeed real. Kash Rangan, a software analyst at the bank, conveyed his viewpoint through an interview featured in Goldman's latest publication, ""Top of Mind."" Rangan stated, ""A.I likely isn't undergoing a period of unwarranted exaggeration. When there's a unanimous consensus within the technology provider community that a genuine technological shift is taking place, it signifies an actual transformation. Furthermore, when customer interest starts to escalate, such enthusiasm shouldn't be dismissed as mere hype. The growing interest from customers solidifies the authenticity of the trend.""

In fact, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, Ben Snider, projects a 1.5% annual productivity growth over the next decade through A.I which can potentially lead to a 30% or higher boost in S&amp;P 500 profits. To read about how AI can replace human jobs, check out our article about Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.To exemplify, we can look at how NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has risen as a leader in AI by spearheading the development of specialized GPUs optimized for intricate AI computations. These GPUs, built with powerful parallel processing capabilities, are exceptionally well-suited for AI tasks. With a 95% market share in the GPU sector, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominance has become more than evident, as it empowers a number of AI applications with outstanding performance and efficiency. Mairs &amp; Power, an investment advisor, released “Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund” that commented in second quarter investor letter:“Regarding stock selection in the first half, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a massive outperformer, up 189.54%. Amazon and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year. Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) computation for both learning and inferencing, and its stock rallied significantly on a massive earnings report in the first quarter as cloud data center companies invested heavily in AI.”In fact, in Q2 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue leaped to $13.5 billion, a twofold YoY increase, driving its stock up 220% since the year's start, with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. The company's specialized AI chips underscore its advantage, and thus, dominate 80% of the global market.Moreover, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s H100 chip which is vital for AI commands double its initial price due to high demand. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering a transformative trend with its groundbreaking ""Algorithm of Thoughts"" (AoT) which signifies a substantial leap forward in AI training. By combining human cognition and algorithmic logic, AoT aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This innovative approach, guided by in-context learning, streamlines problem-solving pathways which would result in faster and less resource-intensive outcomes. With AoT, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) envisions a more organized and systematic exploration of solutions, potentially surpassing the performance of the algorithms themselves. This marks a pertinent shift from traditional supervised learning methods to an integrated search process. As Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) drives this paradigm shift, it underscores their commitment to shaping the future of AI through innovative techniques that can revolutionize problem-solving across industries.List of 55 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USAPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashMethodologyTo prepare the list of artificial intelligence companies in USA, we conducted an extensive research to find out the companies that have been highly active and innovative in the US with their AI applications.

Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Rockwell Automation due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Rockwell Automation Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Rise Y/YRockwell Automation has reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.01 in third-quarter fiscal 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.19.

The total segment operating margin was 21.1% in the fiscal third quarter, higher than the prior-year period’s 20.8%. The improvement in margins was driven by positive price/costs and higher sales volume, partially negated by higher investment spending and incentive compensation.Story continuesSegmental ResultsIntelligent Devices: Net sales amounted to $968 million in the fiscal third quarter, up 10.2% year over year. The reported figure missed our estimate of $996 million. The segment’s operating earnings totaled $163 million compared with the year-earlier quarter’s $173 million. We predicted the segment operating earnings to be $210.7 million in the quarter. The variance was mainly due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation. The segmental operating margin decreased to 16.8% in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter’s 19.7%.Software &amp; Control: Net sales climbed 23.7% year over year to $751 million in the reported quarter. Reported sales surpassed our estimate of $691 million. The segment’s operating earnings increased 37.2% year over year to $262 million. We predicted segment operating earnings of $201.8 million.

ERJ recently announced the expansion of its partnership with CAE Inc. CAE to promote pilot training services for the Embraer E-Jet E2 family of commercial aircraft. The latest joint venture (JV), announced at the 2023 Asia Pacific Airline Training Symposium, should further strengthen Embraer’s position in the commercial aerospace industry.Benefits of the ProgramEmbraer-CAE Training Services (ECTS), built through this JV, includes the provision of pilot and cabin crew training for E-Jet E2 family of jets. The ECTS plans to launch a new pilot training program in December 2023. For this, Embraer will deploy a state-of-the-art E-Jet E2 full-flight simulator (FFS) at the Singapore-CAE Flight Training Centre.The training program will also include CAE 7000XR Series FFSs, including the innovative CAE Tropos 6000XR visual system, as well as CAE XR Series' flight training devices.Notably, to reap the benefits of the expanding E-Jet E2 fleet in the Asia Pacific region, Embraer made the initial launch of the ECTS in Singapore. Considering the fact that the E-Jet services and support are available to more than 940 customers in 70 countries, we may expect ECTS to become available in other parts of the world in the coming years. This, in turn, will boost growth prospects for both Embraer and CAE.Embraer’s Prospects in Commercial AerospacePer the International Air Transport Association’s report, published in June 2023, the first half of 2023 saw a 47.2% increase in global revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) year over year. The demand for air travel is expected to double by 2040, growing at an annual average rate of 3.4%.Such abounding prospects in the air travel business should boost the growth of Embraer’s commercial aviation business. Notably, in August 2023, the company was awarded the Type Certificate by the Civil Aviation Administration of China for its E195-E2 jets, soon after receiving Type Certification from the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia for its E190-E2 and E195-E2.Such developments, along with the company’s latest tie-up with CAE, should enable Embraer to duly reap the benefits of the growing commercial aerospace industry.Story continuesPeer MovesApart from Embraer, aircraft manufacturers in the commercial aviation industry that may gain from the flourishing air travel demand are as follows:Boeing BA: In second-quarter 2023, Boeing delivered 136 commercial airplanes and received 460 net orders. With the new airplanes, which are yet to be delivered, expected to be 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with greater emission reductions than the airplanes they replace, the company should benefit from the trending demand trail.BA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies an improvement of 19.3% from the 2022 reported figure.Airbus EADSY: In first-half 2023, Airbus delivered 316 commercial aircraft.

We will also look at the current trends contributing to slow economic growth in those countries and discuss the companies aiming to alleviate poverty. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to 10 Countries with the Worst Economies in the World in 2023.Interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising inflation, a number of countries had to bear the cost of pandemic in the face of setbacks in education, health, and income losses. According to the World Bank, there was an increase of about 70 million people living in extreme poverty, resulting in the global poverty rate reaching 9.3% in 2020. The official poverty rate of the US reached 11.4%, a 1.0% increase from 10.5% in 2019, the first yearly poverty increase following five consecutive decreases.The ongoing conflict of the Ukraine war and climate shocks have further hindered economic growth worldwide, with food and fuel prices skyrocketing. Considering the recent setbacks, nearly 7% of the world's population will still be living on less than $2.15 per day by 2030, as per the World Bank. Currently, Afghanistan has the lowest GDP growth rate in the world, whereas Ireland is the richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita as of 2023.In addition to impeding US economic development, the Ukraine war has also significantly impacted Europe's economic growth. The economic growth of 2023 was first predicted to increase by 1.2% but was later revised to 0.5% by the IMF. The predicted Global growth by the IMF is expected to decline to 2.7 percent in 2023 from 3.2 percent in 2022 and 6.0 percent in 2021. Except for the global financial crisis and the catastrophic period of the COVID-19 epidemic, this is the slowest growth profile since 2001.In 2021, with the pandemic hampering factory operations and economic growth globally, multiple companies observed shutdown of their retail stores or bankruptcy.Story continuesFor example, during the pandemic, the world's biggest athletic shoe maker, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales due to shipment challenges and a decline in physical store sales. Furthermore, due to supply chain disruptions, including US port congestion and global container shortages, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) experienced about a 10% drop in their revenue in North America in the three months to February 28, 2021. Despite witnessing challenges in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) addressed COVID-19 by maintaining healthy customer engagement and boosting online sales. Moreover, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) committed to $25 million, with more than $2 million in donations for employees, to provide global support for COVID-19 response initiatives. Speaking of the shoe business, you should check out our article on Most Cushioned Walking Shoes for Work. On the other hand, as a result of challenges like fluctuating demand and uncertain economy within the automotive market in South Africa, General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) ceased its local manufacturing and selling of Chevrolet Vehicles in the region back in 2017. General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) decided to exit the manufacturing market in South Africa mainly due to low exports and poor production. The premises permitted General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) to manufacture nearly 100,000 vehicles annually. However, only 34,000 vehicles were manufactured, with 2000-35000 vehicles exported in 2016. Moreover, the company’s attention inclined more towards financially rewarding countries like North America and China, as they wanted to primarily focus on producing autonomous cars. Hence, General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) decided to sell its operations to Isuzu Motors Ltd in South Africa.25 Countries with the Worst Economies in the World in 2023Anton_Ivanov/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023, we have employed GDP growth rate to rank the countries. To ensure that the following list of countries is accurately and fairly ranked, we have sourced the data of the GDP growth rate for the year 2022 for each of the following countries from the World Bank. For the countries with the same GDP growth rate, countries with the higher poverty rate were ranked higher. The list is presented in an ascending order which means countries with lower GDP growth rates have been ranked higher.Note: Since Afghanistan’s GDP growth rate for the years 2022 and 2023 was not available, we have ranked it according to its GDP growth rate in 2021.25. GuatemalaGDP growth rate: 4.1%As Central America's largest economy, Guatemala had a GDP per capita of around $5,025 as of 2022. However, nearly one-half of the children under the age of 5 face severe malnutrition, making it one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world.

MozambiqueGDP growth rate: 4.1%Despite making significant progress in improving Mozambique's poverty rate i.e. 64.6%, the country continues to suffer extreme poverty, with nearly 80% of its total population reliant on surviving on less than $2 per day. However, the growth rate is expected to reach 6% during 2023-2025 due to progress in sectors like services, LNG production, and increased commodity prices.23. HondurasGDP growth rate: 4.0%Honduras is a lower-middle-income country, with around 60% of the population living in poverty. Despite being one of the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023, the economy has the full potential to accelerate its growth owing to its strategic location which has access to ample productive natural resources.22. EswatiniGDP growth rate: 3.9%Factors like high unemployment, continuous population growth, and unfair allocation of resources contribute to Eswatini’s deteriorating economy. As per the 2021 Labor Force Survey, the unemployment rate in the country stood over 33% in 2021, the highest in over a decade.21. MadagascarGDP growth rate: 3.8%According to the World Bank, Madagascar had a GDP worth $14.95 billion in 2022.

Guinea-BissauGDP growth rate: 3.5%Guinea-Bissau is one of the coup-prone and politically unstable countries with a weak economy in the world.

Moreover, the country had a poverty rate of 21.8% in 2022.18. Sierra LeoneGDP growth rate: 3.5%Sierra Leone is one of the poorest economies, with a poverty rate of 26.1% and a GDP of $3.97 billion in 2022.

It is also one of the least developed countries in the world in 2023. 17. ZimbabweGDP growth rate: 3.4%Zimbabwe’s economy is mainly a result of contributions in sectors like agriculture and mining. Issues like high inflation and elevated interest rates have been observed in the country lately. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 7.9 million Zimbabweans were affected by poverty due to economic losses.16. NigeriaGDP growth rate: 3.3%The deteriorating economy of Nigeria has resulted in millions of people being impacted by poverty.

GhanaGDP growth rate: 3.2%The GDP growth was slowed from 5.4% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022, resulting in slower growth for the agricultural and services sectors. Furthermore, the growth is estimated to reach 1.6% in 2023 and remain muted in 2024, according to the World Bank.14. AngolaGDP growth rate: 3.0%Angola's economic fortunes have been linked to global oil demand, resulting in unstable growth and high levels of poverty and inequality. An investment in the private sector is advised to strengthen economic growth and reduce poverty in Angola. Moreover, the high poverty rate has resulted in a high unemployment rate in the country.13. ComorosGDP growth rate: 2.4%Comoros is among the world’s poorest and least developed economies. With a GDP of $1.24 billion as of 2022, the increase in global food and fuel prices has significantly impacted Comoros’s economy, with inflation reaching about 12.5% in 2022. It is one of the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023.12. ChadGDP growth rate: 2.2%Chad, formerly an agricultural economy, joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003, and its economy has been heavily contingent on oil since then. The country’s economy continues to suffer because of political instability, security conflicts, and a lack of infrastructure.11. South AfricaGDP growth rate: 2.0%Although South Africa’s economy is the largest industrialized and technology-driven economy based upon private enterprises in Africa, economic growth has been hindered due to electricity and power shortages. Moreover, inflation and a decline in investment rates have also had a negative impact on the country’s economy.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Universities for Learning Crypto and Blockchain Technology.Blockchain and Crypto: An OverviewIn the era of rapid technological advancement, blockchain and cryptocurrency are among the cutting-edge technologies that have grasped global attention. Blockchains are used to maintain a decentralized, transparent, immutable, and secure record of transactions. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global blockchain technology market was valued at $17.46 billion in 2023. The industry is expected to reach $1.43 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 87.7%. In 2022, North America accounted for 37% of the global blockchain industry revenue. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the fastest growth rate over the forecast period. The growing acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency, the rising popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are fueling the growth of blockchain. Blockchain technology is poised to disrupt various industries, including healthcare, supply chain, manufacturing, and financial services. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a giant in the beauty industry, has been using blockchain to track various components in its supply chain since 2020. The company uses blockchain to track ingredients vulnerable to environmental or labor inconsistencies. Aveda, a brand by the Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), uses blockchain to keep track of their Madagascan vanilla supply. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) has partnered with Wholechain to ensure visibility in the entire supply chain while also enabling stakeholders to check the ingredients' quality. Mediledger Network, administered by Chronicled, uses blockchain in healthcare to curb counterfeit medicine. Mediledger Network works with many pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Genentech. It uses blockchain to validate the authenticity of a drug through the supply chain. It also allows healthcare organizations to process large amounts of product-related data.Story continuesCompanies are also using blockchains to enhance their customer experience. In December 2021, Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) acquired RTKFT. The virtual clothing startup enabled Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to launch Cryptokicks, allowing collectors to own digital along with physical versions of their shoes. The digital versions can be worn in Nikeland in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) metaverse. Cryptokicks ""forges"" NFTs to its shoes by fitting each pair with a tiny chip linked to a blockchain. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also started using decentralized digital identities rooted in blockchain to transform its traditional loyalty program system. Swoosh, a platform by Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), allows users to co-create virtual products. This gamified loyalty program uses blockchain to maintain a transparent and secure record of customer activities. While blockchain has utility outside of cryptocurrencies, its most prominent use case is digital currencies. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $5.15 billion in 2023 and has been projected to grow to $11.71 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12.5%. Despite having a turbulent year in 2022, cryptocurrency has managed to stay relevant in the current financial world. Some of the most prominent companies working on blockchain and cryptocurrency include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). On August 7, Reuters reported that Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first major fintech companies to embrace digital currency by launching a US dollar-based stablecoin. This launch has helped restore some of the confidence lost in cryptocurrency because of several high-profile collapses and strict regulations being imposed.However, cryptocurrency is not out of turmoil yet. On August 25, Reuters reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Binance, a crypto exchange platform, will end their four crypto card programs by mid-September in four countries including Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia, and Brazil. Neither Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) nor Binance has publicly disclosed the reason for the termination of the programs. However, it could have been done in the wake of US lawsuits against Binance filed in June. Blockchain and the Financial Services SectorAccording to the report by Grand View Research, in 2022, the financial services sector had the biggest share of the global blockchain revenue, 37%. Blockchains have the potential to transform how the future of traditional financial institutions would look. Transactions on Wall Street are marked by the involvement of a third party like brokers and market makers which slows things down. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. This shift could transform the entire process, making it more streamlined and efficient. The financial services sector is experiencing an insidious but profound change, slowly transitioning into a future intertwined with blockchain. In November 2022, according to an article by Blockworks, Onyxx by JPMorgan, a bank-led blockchain platform, ran its first decentralized finance transaction on a public blockchain, using Ethereum to exchange Japanese yen for Singaporean dollars. The successful tokenization experiment was a monumental step for DeFi. Umer Farooq, the CEO of Onyx JPMorgan, commented on the potential of blockchain in Wall Street saying:""We have always believed that this technology has the ability to really revolutionize and rewrite financial market infrastructure whether that infrastructure is to move money, securities, or any other kind of assets. So despite all the ups and downs of prices and crypto and all that, I think we've been pretty consistent that the technology itself has a lot of power to rethink financial infrastructure.""On June 5, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan has introduced a blockchain-based platform to settle interbank dollar transactions among six banks in India. This platform would support New Delhi's attempt to push GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) forward. The blockchain-based platform is expected to ease the time required for settlements greatly and would be available around the clock. Blockchains are innately transparent and cut down the need for intermediaries. Tokenization has been gaining popularity worldwide; however, it is important to note that it is not a cure-all. The CNBC article highlighted that implementing tokenization and blockchain would solve only a segment of problems that financial institutions face today, and the transformation could be slow. However, blockchain technology is poised to be a significant part of the financial sector in the future. Many formal education institutions have already gauged the incoming digital revolution and are equipping their students with the knowledge to participate fully in this transformation.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ANSYS'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for ANSYS How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ANSYS is:11% = US$524m ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of ANSYS' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, ANSYS seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining ANSYS' moderate 7.2% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then compared ANSYS' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 19% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ANSS fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is ANSYS Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that ANSYS doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with ANSYS' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Vans performance is also concerning.However, the North Face and China business have been experiencing momentum. The company is also seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, allowing it to capitalize on revenue opportunities. It has also been managing costs and inventory position. Overall, management expects a better second-half revenue performance with respect to the first half on improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing year-over-year comparisons.For fiscal 2024, the bottom line is envisioned to be $2.05-$2.25 per share.

If you wish to see the list directly, head to 8 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System.Despite the surge of healthcare innovations in this era, it's disheartening to witness the vast disparities in healthcare quality among countries. Several nations suffer from inefficient and inaccessible healthcare systems. These inadequacies, beyond the immediate public health implications, can have detrimental effects on national economies. Countries like the Central African Republic, Chad, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Haiti, and others consistently find themselves at the bottom of global healthcare rankings. In these nations, healthcare system issues arise from inadequate infrastructure, insufficient training for medical and paramedic staff, constrained budgets, and inadequate care for newborns and mothers, among other challenges. On the topic of newborn care, we have previously discussed the 20 Countries with the Highest Rates of Infant Mortality; you can read our article to find out where infants face the greatest risk.It's worth noting that countries with the worst healthcare systems not only represent a health crisis but also economic challenges. For instance, unhealthy workers tend to be less efficient and take more sick days, thereby reducing national productivity. Another consequence of a fragile healthcare system is brain drain; medical professionals from these countries often search for better opportunities abroad, causing an alarming talent drain in the home country, further worsening the situation. For example, a survey conducted by the Pakistan Journal Of Medical Sciences found that 33.3% of fresh medical graduates plan to leave Pakistan and settle abroad because of long working hours and poor pay. A subpar healthcare system can also dissuade foreign investors who may be concerned about the health of the workforce and potential medical costs. Considering the impact of weak healthcare systems on tourism and associated revenue, countries with persistent public health issues, especially contagious diseases, invariably witness a decline in tourism. For instance, following the first report of the Ebola virus in 2013, by August 2014, nearly half of the monthly flights scheduled to Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone were canceled, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.Story continuesLogically, countries grappling with healthcare crises could look to emulate the systems of the 15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The World. But since most countries with the worst healthcare system are least developed and heavily indebted, budget allocations to the healthcare sector and policy reforms hinder this development. Companies' Ability to Innovate Healthcare For Poorer CountriesGlobal pharmaceutical and healthcare behemoths like Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Abbott (NYSE:ABT) possess the resources, expertise, and networks to revolutionize healthcare in impoverished nations. For example, given the larger populations and often a higher prevalence of certain diseases in less affluent countries, these companies can offer volume-based discounts. In this aspect, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) has already committed to selling 23 patented drugs, including Comirnaty (their COVID-19 vaccine), to 45 underprivileged countries on a not-for-profit basis.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also continues to report strong performance of its core drugs along with the COVID-19 vaccine, which has been shipped to over 181 countries since December 2020. Similarly, another pharmaceutical giant, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), operates in over 160 countries, and the company's motto for 2030 is to enhance the lives of one in every three individuals, i.e., 3 billion people a year. Intriguingly, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)'s diagnostic kits for the virus witnessed skyrocketing sales. In the first quarter of 2021, COVID-19 diagnostic-testing sales accounted for $2.2 billion of the company's total $10.5 billion in sales.Diseases and health issues that predominantly plague poorer countries often don't attract ample research attention due to potentially unprofitable markets. To address this and aid these nations, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) pledged $30 million in 2014 to enhance newborn health and boost survival rates until 2020. This commitment supported initiatives in 20 countries with high neonatal mortality rates, including Nigeria and Ethiopia. Furthermore, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) collaborated with Save the Children to offer newborn resuscitation and other vital services to approximately one million children globally.Now, let's turn our attention to countries with the worst healthcare systems.25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare SystemOur MethodologyWe shortlisted countries with the worst healthcare systems in the world based on three metrics: First, we selected the 25 lowest-ranking countries from the health pillar of the Legatum Prosperity Index. This index measures the extent to which people in over 167 countries are healthy and have access to necessary healthcare services. Next, we referred to the Global Health Index 2021. This index, developed in partnership between the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, analyzes countries' preparedness to handle situations like COVID-19 and the general healthcare access their populations enjoy. The Global Health Index categorizes countries into 5 tiers based on their ability to handle disease outbreaks. The tiers' are:Tier 1 = 0-20Tier 2 = 20.1-40Tier 3 = 40.1-60Tier 4 = 60.1-80Tier 5 = 80.1-100Countries falling in tier 5 are supposed to have the best healthcare system, while those in the 1st tier are the worst in terms of healthcare provision. The index noted that none of the countries managed to be in the 5th tier, and the average score for over 190 countries was 38.5 out of 100. Any country with a score below 38.5 is in the alarming zone and does not have enough resources in the healthcare sector.Lastly, and most importantly, we identified countries with the lowest life expectancy from the World Bank Database, as this metric indicates how effectively a country manages chronic and infectious diseases. To develop a scoring system for these countries, we used the weighted averaging method. We assigned a weight of 0.4 to life expectancy, 0.3 to the health pillar of the Legatum Prosperity Index, and 0.3 to the Global Health Index. Notably, the country with the lowest score on our list has the worst healthcare system in the world. We then listed these nations in descending order based on their healthcare systems.Based on our findings, here are the 25 countries with the worst healthcare systems:25. MadagascarInsider Monkey Score: 22.2In 2023, Madagascar has a population of nearly 30 million and a GDP of $15 billion. Almost two-thirds of the country's population lives below the poverty line, lacking enough capital to spend on adequate healthcare. The healthcare system in Madagascar is highly underfunded due to a lack of infrastructure and insufficient qualified personnel. The majority of medical facilities are concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural inhabitants underserved. Poverty, limited government spending on health, and frequent natural disasters further hinder the country's ability to establish a reliable healthcare system.24. HaitiInsider Monkey Score: 20.8Healthcare in Haiti is characterized by a heavy reliance on international aid, as it is among the countries with the highest rates of poverty. Insufficient public funding and a shortage of healthcare professionals exacerbate the nation's situation. The 2010 earthquake destroyed much of Haiti's already fragile infrastructure. With 29.2% of the population living in extreme poverty, availing of sufficient healthcare becomes challenging.23. Republic Of CongoInsider Monkey Score: 18.8The Republic of Congo is one of the hungriest countries in the world due to its extreme poverty and poor administration. Currently, 35.4% of the country's population survives on less than $2.15 a day, and recurrent epidemics make life difficult for them. Although the government has made strides in improving healthcare, many regions remain underserved because of geographical barriers. Endemic diseases, such as yellow fever and malaria, place additional burdens on an already strained system.22. NigerInsider Monkey Score: 18.7In Niger, the current GDP is $16.617 billion, and over 50.6% of its population lives in extreme poverty. The country's healthcare system faces challenges like high infant and maternal mortality rates, which can be attributed to malnutrition, infectious diseases, and limited access to clean water and sanitation. Despite efforts, Niger lacks the medical facilities and trained professionals needed to cater to its growing population, especially since it ranks third among countries with the highest rates of population growth.21. Papua New GuineaInsider Monkey Score: 17.8Healthcare in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is challenged by rugged terrain, which impedes access to remote areas, and a shortage of qualified medical personnel. PNG contends with high rates of communicable diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. With almost 40% of the population living in extreme poverty, delivering uniform healthcare is complicated in PNG.20. AfghanistanInsider Monkey Score: 17.1Decades of conflict has severely impacted Afghanistan's healthcare system, which has a current score of 28.8 (out of 100), according to the Global Health Index. Additionally, nearly half the people in Afghanistan grapple with severe economic challenges, leading to poor health outcomes and a high mortality rate. The country's per capita GDP is $363, making it the seventh hungriest country in the world.19. MozambiqueInsider Monkey Score: 16.8Mozambique suffers from a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, and its heavy reliance on foreign aid results in a high burden of diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. Frequent natural disasters and a significant disease burden strain the country's fragile system. The Borgen Project reports that many people in rural Mozambique remain impoverished and are consequently cut off from the healthcare system.18. LiberiaInsider Monkey Score: 16.8Liberia's healthcare system suffered immensely due to a 14-year civil war, which devastated infrastructure and resulted in a significant exodus of medical professionals. The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak further exposed the system's weaknesses, including a lack of isolation units and trained personnel. Rebuilding and fortifying the health system is a priority in Liberia. However, with poverty being a significant concern, the government's spending on the healthcare sector is only 9.5% of its $3.5 billion GDP.17. AngolaInsider Monkey Score: 15.8Angola allocates 2.9% of its $67 billion GDP to the healthcare sector, earning it a score of 29.1 out of 100 on the Global Health Index. Despite the country's oil wealth, there is a troubling disparity in healthcare access. While urban areas are better equipped, rural regions are often neglected. Diseases like malaria, yellow fever, and cholera are prevalent in Angola, adding more pressure to its already strained healthcare system.16. MaliInsider Monkey Score: 15.7Mali's current GDP stands at approximately $19.14 billion, with 4.31% dedicated to the healthcare sector. The country grapples with a high incidence of diseases like schistosomiasis, malaria, and malnutrition, which demand more resources. Financial barriers often deter many from seeking treatment, especially considering that nearly 15% of the population lives in extreme poverty.15. Côte D'IvoireInsider Monkey Score: 14.9Côte D'Ivoire's healthcare system is heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS and malaria. Insufficient funds (the country spends 3.72% of its $70 billion GDP on healthcare) and a shortage of trained professionals exacerbate the problems in its healthcare system. While urban centers like Abidjan offer adequate medical facilities, rural areas lag behind. Past political instability and civil conflicts have further constrained government healthcare expenditure.14. CameroonInsider Monkey Score: 14.8Cameroon is among the countries with bad healthcare. Cameroon's GDP is nearly $45 billion, with 3.77% dedicated to healthcare. According to the Global Health Index, Cameroon scored 28.6 out of 100 and secured 149th rank out of 190 countries in terms of disease management capacity. The country boasts a diverse health infrastructure that includes public, private, and traditional sectors. However, resource constraints and mismanagement are prevalent issues.13. Sierra LeoneInsider Monkey Score: 14.3Sierra Leone faces an extreme poverty rate of 26.1%, and its Global Health Index score is 32.7. The country's health system is still rebounding from the aftershocks of its civil war and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. These calamities severely impacted the already fragile healthcare infrastructure, resulting in an overburdened workforce. Additionally, Sierra Leone contends with some of the world's highest child mortality rates, registering 72.3 deaths per 1000 live births.12. BeninInsider Monkey Score: 13.9In Benin, the healthcare sector expenditure is 2.59% of its GDP, indicating limited resources. Another challenge pushing Benin among countries with struggling healthcare systems is the inadequate training of health workers. Although healthcare is nominally free for children under five and pregnant women, many still incur out-of-pocket expenses.11. NigeriaInsider Monkey Score: 11.6Nigeria is one of the countries with the worst healthcare in the world. It struggles with looming poverty and unemployment, which adversely impact public health. The country designates 3.38% of its GDP to healthcare. However, despite its substantial economic resources, corruption, underfunding, and a lack of infrastructure hamper Nigeria's healthcare system.10. Democratic Republic Of CongoInsider Monkey Score: 11.3In DR Congo, 60% of the population lives on less than $2.15 a day, making out-of-pocket health expenses prohibitive for many. The country's healthcare system struggles due to prolonged conflict, manifesting in a severe shortage of infrastructure, resources, and trained staff. DR Congo's Global Health Index score stands at 26.1, and the nation allocates 4.05% of its GDP to health.9. Equatorial GuineaInsider Monkey Score: 11Equatorial Guinea's health system remains under-resourced and inefficient despite its oil wealth. A stark disparity exists between the healthcare quality available to the elite and the broader population. Endemic diseases, particularly malaria, further strain the country's healthcare system.Click to continue reading 8 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System.Suggested Articles:10 Healthcare Stocks with Insider Buying15 Worst Performing Healthcare Stocks in 202315 European Countries with Best Healthcare for ExpatsDisclosure: None. 25 Countries With The Worst Healthcare System was originally published at Insider Monkey.]"
202,8afd0a21-53b6-35a1-bd89-8396fff765ba,PFE,2023-09-01,Why Is Pfizer (PFE) Up 1.6% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pfizer-pfe-1-6-153127483.html,1693495887,STORY,['PFE'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Pfizer (PFE). Shares have added about 1.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pfizer due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q2 Earnings Beat, Sales MissPfizer reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents per share. Earnings declined 67% year over year.Revenues came in at $12.73 billion, down 54% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis, reflecting an operational decline of 53% and currency headwinds of 1%. Total revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.17 billion.The decline, as expected, was due to a steep drop in revenues from its COVID-19 products on lower demand.Excluding revenues from COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, sales rose 5% operationally.Though the decline in sales of COVID products was expected, sales of several other key medicines like Prevnar, alliance revenues from Eliquis and Ibrance missed expectations. Pfizer said that some near-term individual product challenges hurt its sales performance in the quarter. The short-term headwinds included tornado damage to Pfizer’s facility in Rocky Mount, approval of Talzenna in the United States in a narrower patient population than expected and shared decision-making recommendation by ACIP for RSV vaccine for older adults.Nonetheless, some key products like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and newly acquired products like Nurtec ODT/Vydura for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease provided some top-line support.International revenues declined 59% to $6.55 billion. U.S. revenues declined 45% to $6.2 billion.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&amp;A) expenses rose 20% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.42 billion due to increased spending for new products and recently acquired products. Adjusted R&amp;D expenses declined 6% to $2.63 billion.Story continuesSegment DiscussionPfizer reports its revenues under three broad sub-segments of its Biopharma operating segment, Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. Sales of the Primary Care segment declined 72% operationally to $5.81 billion. The Specialty Care unit recorded sales of $3.65 billion, up 12%. Sales of Oncology declined 3% to $2.96 billion.Primary CareIn Primary Care, direct sales and alliance revenues from BioNTech for Comirnaty were $1.49 billion in the quarter, down 82% year over year. Comirnaty sales declined 98% in the United States due to lower contracted deliveries to the U.S. government. Comirnaty sales declined 80% outside U.S. markets due to lower demand and contracted deliveries. Comirnaty sales beat our estimate of $1.23 billion.Paxlovid contributed $143 million to sales in the quarter, compared with $8.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Paxlovid sales missed our estimate of $610 million. There were no Paxlovid sales in the United States in the second quarter while contracted deliveries were significantly low in most international markets.Alliance revenues and direct sales from Bristol-Myers’ Eliquis rose 2% to $1.76 billion. Alliance revenues from Bristol-Myers for Eliquis missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86 billion as well as our model estimate of $2.0 billion.Global Prevnar family revenues declined 1% to $1.39 billion. The Prevnar family includes revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult). Prevnar revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.47 billion.Prevnar sales declined 9% in the United States. Prevnar revenues rose 12% in international markets.Newly acquired product Nurtec ODT/Vydura contributed $247 million in the second quarter compared with $167 million in the previous quarter. Nurtec ODT/Vydura was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of most of Biohaven in 2022.Specialty CareRare disease drug, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax recorded sales of $782 million in the quarter, up 43% year over year. Vyndaqel/Vyndamax sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $722 million as well as our model estimate of $682 million.Xeljanz sales rose 11% to $469 million. Xeljanz sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $341 million as well as our model estimate of $357.4 million.Enbrel revenues declined 11% to $219 million due to continued biosimilar competition in key European markets and Japan.New product, Oxbryta generated sales of $77 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $71 million in the previous quarter. Oxbryta was added with the October 2022 acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics.New drug Cibinqo, approved last year, recorded revenues of $38 million in the second quarter compared to $1 million in the year-ago quarter.OncologyIn Oncology, Ibrance revenues declined 4% year over year to $1.25 billion. Ibrance sales were hurt due to competitive pressure, which hurt demand trends globally, planned price decreases in certain international developed markets and lower clinical trial purchases.Ibrance revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.32 billion.Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $305 million in the quarter, up 5% year over year. Inlyta revenues were $262 million in the quarter, down 3%.2023 GuidancePfizer narrowed its 2023 revenue guidance as well as its non-COVID operational revenue growth expectations.Revenues are expected in the range of $67.0 to $70.0 billion compared with $67.0 to $71.0 billion expected previously, indicating an operational decline of 31% from the 2022 level, at the midpoint.The revenue guidance includes approximately $13.5 billion in sales from Comirnaty, down 64% from the 2022 level, and Paxlovid sales of approximately $8 billion, down 58%.Pfizer expects to launch both products in traditional commercial markets in the United States in the second half of 2023 as the company transitions away from the government market due to lower demand.Pfizer said it will have more clarity regarding how its COVID products will perform in commercial markets by the time of third quarter results. It believes the fall/winter seasonal vaccination utilization rate will give it visibility into potential annual COVID revenues in commercial markets. However, Pfizer hinted at potential cost cuts in 2024 if demand comes in lower than expected.Pfizer expects new COVID-19 wave to start in the United States in the fall.Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer expects its revenues to rise 6% to 8% on an operational basis in 2023, compared with 7% to 9% previously. The decline in its non-COVID operational revenue growth expectations is due to the short-term headwinds, discussed above.Pfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the second half to be driven by its in-line products, new launches like the RSV vaccine for older adults and Zavzpret for migraine as well as newly acquired products like Nurtec and Oxbryta.Pfizer maintained all other components of its 2023 financial guidance. The adjusted earnings per share guidance was maintained in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, implying an operational decline of 47%, at the midpoint, from the 2022 level.The expected decline in adjusted earnings is due to lower revenues from COVID products coupled with higher spending for near-term launches and late-stage pipeline candidates.Adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, is expected in the range of 28 of total revenues. Research and development expense is expected in the range of $12.4-$13.4 billion. SI&amp;A spending is expected in the range of $13.8-$14.8 billion.Acquired IPR&amp;D expenses are expected to be approximately $0.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 15% in 2023. Adjusted other (income)/deductions are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion of income.Progress on Seagen AcquisitionPfizer offered to buy cancer drugmaker Seagen for $229 per share in cash or a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion in March.Seagen’s acquisition is expected to strengthen Pfizer’s portfolio of cancer drugs by adding a class of antibody-drug conjugates. Seagen currently markets four cancer drugs — Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak. The Pfizer/Seagen transaction is expected to be closed in late 2023 or early 2024. The shareholders of Seagen have already approved the deal.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.52% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Pfizer has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

203,26f13841-1661-4bee-a3f2-88ed744edf6d,PFE,2023-09-01,Big Pharma's biggest ally gets trolled on X for attacking Medicare drug pricing list,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-pharmas-biggest-ally-gets-trolled-on-x-for-attacking-medicare-drug-pricing-list-152212420.html,1693495332,STORY,"['MRK', 'NVS', 'NVSEF', 'ABBV', 'NONOF', 'NVO', 'AZN', 'AZNCF', 'AMGN', 'PFE', 'BMY', 'JNJ']","[The largest drug lobbying firm, PhRMA, took to social media to denounce Medicare's drug pricing negotiation list.The firm's X (formerly Twitter) account reposted the White House tweet announcing the first 10 drugs on the roster for negotiation, saying the Biden Administration is ""giving a single government agency power to arbitrarily set medicine prices with little accountability, oversight or input from patients and their doctors — with consequences long after this administration is gone.""The PhRMA tweet has more than 1.4 million views and thousands of comments. X/Twitter users were quick to point out the hypocrisy of the post, saying the drug companies are also single entities that arbitrarily set medicine prices.""As opposed to the current system, where you arbitrarily set medicine prices high enough to satisfy your shareholders and pay your CEOs obscene salaries?"" wrote @joekatz45.Another user, @DrMattDSW, wrote, ""lmao when did we ever have input into our (outrageously expensive) Rx prices? Never. We’ve never had input. And considering how much research is funded by the government (which means through our tax dollars) I am more than okay with lower prices for everyone. Get bent.""What @WhiteHouse isn't telling you: They're giving a single government agency power to arbitrarily set medicine prices with little accountability, oversight or input from patients &amp; their doctors—with consequences long after this administration is gone. https://t.co/t5UeVnWftr https://t.co/YnGpmUUDl4— PhRMA (@PhRMA) August 29, 2023Yahoo Finance spoke with a half-dozen health policy experts about the backlash, which continued to escalate late Wednesday — more than 24 hours after the post was published.Story continuesAndrew Mulcahy, senior health economist at The RAND Corporation, said the tweet was a little off-target — especially in claiming that the government was arbitrarily setting prices without input from patients and doctors.""Congress was very specific in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. There is a very long guidance document that HHS [Health and Human Services] put out that got commented on, and revised. It's hard to say that they're doing it without patients and doctors,"" Mulcahey said.Anna Kaltenboeck, a former senior health adviser on the Senate Finance Committee who helped write the IRA, reposted the tweet from PhRMA and ""fixed"" it to reflect support for the law.""They are railing against a policy that more than 80% of Americans agree with ... that's both Democrats and Republicans. So if you have that level of unity on an issue and we are this divided as a country, on a partisan basis, that tells you something,"" Kaltenboeck, principal and head of drug reimbursement at healthcare research firm ATI Advisory, told Yahoo Finance.Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said the social media post was a sign of how aggressively the industry is fighting negotiations.""The fact that the drug industry is continuing to fight this shows they’re worried that it’s a foot in the door for broader government price-setting powers. I have to believe PhRMA is hoping for a Republican sweep in 2024, with the potential to roll back or slow down price negotiation,"" Levitt said.Michael Sinha, assistant professor of law at St. Louis University of Law, agreed. He said that though the Congressional Budget Office estimates show low impact to innovation and drug R&amp;D, the industry is still looking to rally support to overturn the IRA if the upcoming election gives it a favorable political environment to do so.""PhRMA doesn’t want to go down without a fight. It is used to winning,"" he said.Legal battle aheadPharmaceutical companies have filed more than a half-dozen lawsuits in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected. The lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging the companies are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Sinha said the suits are ""bizarre"" and would set a dangerous precedent if the industry wins. KFF's Levitt said the outcome is still uncertain.""The pharmaceutical industry may yet be successful at using the courts to stop government negotiation of drug prices, but I think they're going to have a tough time winning over the public. Giving the government authority to negotiate drug prices in Medicare is enormously popular across partisan lines, and the public doesn't buy the arguments against it,"" Levitt added.The Biden Administration has similarly said it will be hard to put the cat back in the bag.""It's important to remember that basically what pharma is arguing in these court cases is that they should have no limit to be able to charge whatever they want, and that is exactly why Americans support Medicare drug negotiations,"" said Biden's domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden on Tuesday.Kaltenboeck said she is confident the law will stand up in court.""We tried our very best to make this thing as navigable as possible for all the stakeholders involved, and clear as possible,"" she said.Tanden noted that given that the negotiation process is happening publicly, with the prices published next September, it will be hard to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act — just as it has been to repeal the Affordable Care Act — and to ""claw back these benefits, these lower prices,"" Tanden said.A health economist, who was not authorized to speak to media, said there could be negative ramifications to the economics of drug research with this move by the administration.""Overall I find the whole discussion about this being 'popular' or 'polling well' a bit silly. Unsurprisingly, people like paying less for something. And we aren’t forcing people to consider that they are also going to pay for low prices today with fewer drugs in the future,"" the economist said.Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale University, said the lobbying firm's tweet showed how tone-deaf it was to the majority of public opinion.""Nearly 20 years ago, PhRMA pulled the biggest hoax on the American people in successfully lobbying Congress to not negotiate reasonable prices of drugs as almost every other similar country does. This is long overdue and this tweet and their lawsuits make clear that PhRMA continues to prioritize maximizing their profits instead of patient access,"" she said.Kaltenboeck added that the industry has no obligation to offer its products through Medicare, and has for too long been forcing Medicare to sell at whatever prices they set.""You don't have to sell your drugs to Medicare, there is no Constitutional obligation. So they are free to avoid the program,"" she said.PhRMA declined to comment.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The companies are preparing to roll out its updated vaccine to applicable EU member states, immediately after a decision from the EMA.Year to date, shares of Pfizer have fallen 29.9% against the industry’s 8.1% rise. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Furthermore, the CHMP has also recommended the use of the updated vaccine for children aged six months to four years, as part or all of the primary three-dose vaccination series, with certain conditions. The vaccine can also be administered as a single dose for those with a history of completion of a Covid-19 primary vaccination course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.The recommendation made by the CHMP was based on preclinical data which showed that the updated vaccine was effective against multiple XBB sublineages, including XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and XBB.2.3 compared with the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent Covid-19 vaccine.Shares of BNTX climbed 2% in the last trading session in response to the encouraging news. Year to date, BioNTech’s shares have suffered a loss of 16.7% compared with the industry’s 11.9% fall. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The companies have been commercially manufacturing the updated Covid-19 vaccine at risk to ensure supply readiness for the upcoming fall and winter season when the demand for COVID-19 vaccination is expected to soar.Story continuesA Reuters article suggested that the Biden administration will start a fall campaign urging all Americans to inoculate themselves with the updated COVID-19 vaccines.The report came to light amid the rising COVID-19 infection cases as new subvariants of the virus continue to emerge. Per the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), total hospitalizations due to COVID-19 rose by almost 19% in the most recent week.The current updated version of the PFE/BNTX Covid-19 vaccine is also found to be effective against the EG.5.1 (also known as Eris) variant. Recently designated by the World Health Organization as a variant of interest, Eris is currently the dominant variant in the United States. Infection cases from FL.1.5.1 (also known as Fornax) are growing in the United States. Per the latest CDC data, Eris is responsible for about 21% of COVID-19 infections in the country, while Fornax accounted for more than 13% of all cases nationwide.Pfizer and BioNTech have also filed for regulatory approval in the United States for its Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent Covid-19 vaccine for individuals aged six months and older.

QuoteOther players in the Covid-19 vaccine market, such as Moderna MRNA and Novavax NVAX, are currently gearing up for the anticipated increase in demand for Covid-19 vaccines in the upcoming fall and winter seasons.Earlier this month, Moderna reported preliminary results from a clinical study showing that its updated Covid-19 vaccine mRNA-1273.815 significantly boosted neutralizing antibodies against the Eris and Fornax variants. Moderna has also submitted a regulatory application to the FDA seeking approval for mRNA-1273.815.A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. A similar regulatory submission is also currently under review in Europe. Moderna remains committed to being ready with sufficient global supply during the upcoming fall season.Last week, Novavax announced that its updated protein-based XBB Covid vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibody against the Eris and XBB subvariant, including XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3 variants, in non-clinical studies. In its second-quarter earnings release, NVAX reported having initiated a filing with the FDA for its updated Covid-19 vaccine. It aims to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks.Novavax stated that it is manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB Covid vaccine candidate commercially, which is intended to be in the market during the upcoming fall vaccination campaign. It aims to make its updated vaccine available and accessible on par with other Covid-19 vaccines. If approved, Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine would be the only non-mRNA protein-based XBB Covid vaccine available.Zacks RankCurrently, Pfizer and BioNTech carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

If you are not interested in reading the detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Apps in the US. Welcome to the world of cryptocurrency trading in the United States in 2023, where the landscape is constantly evolving, and the choices for cryptocurrency exchanges and apps have never been more diverse. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to surge, the demand for secure, user-friendly, and feature-rich platforms has reached unprecedented heights. In exploring the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps available to US residents, we will delve into the leading platforms catering to newcomers and seasoned traders like Binance KuCoin and Crypto.com, among others. Whether you're looking for a platform to buy, sell, or trade digital assets or seeking advanced features for your cryptocurrency portfolio management, this guide will provide valuable insights into the top options available in this exciting and dynamic era of crypto. One of the most critical decisions when investing in cryptocurrency is choosing the proper exchange and app. Not all businesses and apps are created equal, and making the wrong choice could result in lost funds or missed opportunities. The importance of choosing the proper exchange and app First and foremost, you'll want to choose an exchange and app that is reputable and secure. Look for deals and apps with a proven track record of protecting users' funds and personal information. For example, in March 2023, the exchange platform Coinbase reported holding more than $130 billion in assets, proving its commitment to security and trust. Additionally, be sure to choose an exchange and app that is user-friendly and easy to navigate, as this will make it easier for you to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Another essential factor is the selection of cryptocurrencies available on the exchange and app. Different businesses and apps may offer other cryptocurrencies, so choose one that provides the cryptocurrencies you're interested in investing in. The global cryptocurrency market has reached a value of over $1.13 trillion, highlighting the vast array of options available for investment. Story continuesFinally, consider the fees associated with the exchange and app. Some businesses and apps charge higher fees than others, so factoring this into your decision-making process is essential. For instance, Binance charges a trading fee of 0.1%, while Coinbase charges a higher cost of 1.49%. By taking the time to research and choose the proper cryptocurrency exchange and app, you'll be setting yourself up for success in the exciting world of cryptocurrency investing, where every dollar and percentage point counts. Recent regulatory developments affecting US cryptocurrency exchangesIn the United States, cryptocurrency exchanges are facing significant regulatory changes driven by increased government scrutiny over concerns related to money laundering and illicit activities within the cryptocurrency sector. These changes primarily include mandatory registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency responsible for monitoring financial transactions to combat illegal activities. Compliance with specific guidelines and regulations is required for legality and transparency. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on compliance with securities laws, with notable cases of cryptocurrency exchanges being accused of offering unregistered securities to investors violating this law, which has prompted many exchanges to prioritize compliance to avoid legal consequences. The cryptocurrency industry has experienced substantial global losses due to related crimes, surpassing $1 billion in 2021. In the United States, FinCEN has assessed civil monetary penalties exceeding $29.2 million against Bittrex in 2022. Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed a $10 million fine on a cryptocurrency exchange in 2021 for securities law violations. These statistics underscore the pivotal role of regulatory developments in protecting investors and preventing financial crimes, reflecting the heightened regulatory attention on the expanding cryptocurrency market. Glimpsing into the Crystal Ball: What Lies Ahead for Cryptocurrency Markets and Platforms Looking ahead to the future of cryptocurrency markets and platforms, we encounter both exciting developments and challenges. The growing demand for digital currencies is evident, driven by increasing awareness of their technology and potential uses. The cryptocurrency landscape will be influenced by several factors, including regulatory shifts, technological progress, and evolving market trends. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a notable trend expected to have a significant impact as more investors seek decentralized platforms and applications. Stablecoins, digital currencies tied to stable assets like the US dollar, are also gaining prominence. They offer a means to mitigate the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies, making them appealing to a broader range of investors. In 2023, the pinnacle of stablecoin market capitalization has receded, experiencing a 25% decline to $120 billion, underscoring the increasing interest in stablecoins and their potential influence on the cryptocurrency market's future. 13 best Cryptocurrency Exchanges And Apps In US In 2023Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology  Our methodology for identifying the best cryptocurrency exchanges and apps in the US in 2023 involved conducting thorough research using sources like Coinsutra, G2, Yahoo Finance, Guru99, and Forbes.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Universities for Learning Crypto and Blockchain Technology.Blockchain and Crypto: An OverviewIn the era of rapid technological advancement, blockchain and cryptocurrency are among the cutting-edge technologies that have grasped global attention. Blockchains are used to maintain a decentralized, transparent, immutable, and secure record of transactions. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global blockchain technology market was valued at $17.46 billion in 2023. The industry is expected to reach $1.43 trillion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 87.7%. In 2022, North America accounted for 37% of the global blockchain industry revenue. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the fastest growth rate over the forecast period. The growing acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency, the rising popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are fueling the growth of blockchain. Blockchain technology is poised to disrupt various industries, including healthcare, supply chain, manufacturing, and financial services. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a giant in the beauty industry, has been using blockchain to track various components in its supply chain since 2020. The company uses blockchain to track ingredients vulnerable to environmental or labor inconsistencies. Aveda, a brand by the Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), uses blockchain to keep track of their Madagascan vanilla supply. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) has partnered with Wholechain to ensure visibility in the entire supply chain while also enabling stakeholders to check the ingredients' quality. Mediledger Network, administered by Chronicled, uses blockchain in healthcare to curb counterfeit medicine. Mediledger Network works with many pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Genentech. It uses blockchain to validate the authenticity of a drug through the supply chain. It also allows healthcare organizations to process large amounts of product-related data.Story continuesCompanies are also using blockchains to enhance their customer experience. In December 2021, Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) acquired RTKFT. The virtual clothing startup enabled Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to launch Cryptokicks, allowing collectors to own digital along with physical versions of their shoes. The digital versions can be worn in Nikeland in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) metaverse. Cryptokicks ""forges"" NFTs to its shoes by fitting each pair with a tiny chip linked to a blockchain. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also started using decentralized digital identities rooted in blockchain to transform its traditional loyalty program system. Swoosh, a platform by Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), allows users to co-create virtual products. This gamified loyalty program uses blockchain to maintain a transparent and secure record of customer activities. While blockchain has utility outside of cryptocurrencies, its most prominent use case is digital currencies. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $5.15 billion in 2023 and has been projected to grow to $11.71 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12.5%. Despite having a turbulent year in 2022, cryptocurrency has managed to stay relevant in the current financial world. Some of the most prominent companies working on blockchain and cryptocurrency include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). On August 7, Reuters reported that Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first major fintech companies to embrace digital currency by launching a US dollar-based stablecoin. This launch has helped restore some of the confidence lost in cryptocurrency because of several high-profile collapses and strict regulations being imposed.However, cryptocurrency is not out of turmoil yet. On August 25, Reuters reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Binance, a crypto exchange platform, will end their four crypto card programs by mid-September in four countries including Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia, and Brazil. Neither Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) nor Binance has publicly disclosed the reason for the termination of the programs. However, it could have been done in the wake of US lawsuits against Binance filed in June. Blockchain and the Financial Services SectorAccording to the report by Grand View Research, in 2022, the financial services sector had the biggest share of the global blockchain revenue, 37%. Blockchains have the potential to transform how the future of traditional financial institutions would look. Transactions on Wall Street are marked by the involvement of a third party like brokers and market makers which slows things down. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. This shift could transform the entire process, making it more streamlined and efficient. The financial services sector is experiencing an insidious but profound change, slowly transitioning into a future intertwined with blockchain. In November 2022, according to an article by Blockworks, Onyxx by JPMorgan, a bank-led blockchain platform, ran its first decentralized finance transaction on a public blockchain, using Ethereum to exchange Japanese yen for Singaporean dollars. The successful tokenization experiment was a monumental step for DeFi. Umer Farooq, the CEO of Onyx JPMorgan, commented on the potential of blockchain in Wall Street saying:""We have always believed that this technology has the ability to really revolutionize and rewrite financial market infrastructure whether that infrastructure is to move money, securities, or any other kind of assets. So despite all the ups and downs of prices and crypto and all that, I think we've been pretty consistent that the technology itself has a lot of power to rethink financial infrastructure.""On June 5, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan has introduced a blockchain-based platform to settle interbank dollar transactions among six banks in India. This platform would support New Delhi's attempt to push GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) forward. The blockchain-based platform is expected to ease the time required for settlements greatly and would be available around the clock. Blockchains are innately transparent and cut down the need for intermediaries. Tokenization has been gaining popularity worldwide; however, it is important to note that it is not a cure-all. The CNBC article highlighted that implementing tokenization and blockchain would solve only a segment of problems that financial institutions face today, and the transformation could be slow. However, blockchain technology is poised to be a significant part of the financial sector in the future. Many formal education institutions have already gauged the incoming digital revolution and are equipping their students with the knowledge to participate fully in this transformation.

Shares have added about 5.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Petroleum due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Marathon Q2 Earnings Top Despite a Plunge in MarginsIndependent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.32, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 on the back of lower costs and expenses.However, the company’s bottom line fell from the year-ago adjusted profit of $10.61 due to weaker-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $2.3 billion, below our projection of $2.8 billion.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $36.8 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31 billion but declined 32.1% year over year.Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $2.3 billion, which plunged from the year-ago profit of $7.1 billion. The decline primarily reflects lower year-over-year margins and refined product sales to go with a decrease in capacity utilization.Specifically, the refining margin of $22.10 per barrel compared to $37.54 a year ago though it came ahead of our estimate of $17.98. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 93%, down from 100% in the corresponding period of 2022. We expected the metric to be 91.3%. The year-over-year tick-down reflects planned maintenance activity in the Mid-Continent and West Coast regions. The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $768 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and refined product sales that more than offset lower capacity utilization.Story continuesMeanwhile, total refined product sales volumes were 3,581 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), down from 3,615 mbpd in the year-ago quarter and our estimate of 3,630.2 mbpd. Throughput also fell from 3,069 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,925 mbpd but outperformed our estimate of 2,860 mbpd.MPC’s operating costs per barrel edged down from $5.19 in the year-ago quarter to $5.15. The company managed to reign in expenses due to lower energy outgo and disciplined execution. Our estimates factored in a higher unit cost of $5.20.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP— a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 6.7% from the second quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Financial AnalysisFinancial AnalysisIn the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $562 million on capital programs (43% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 48% on the Midstream segment) compared to $577 million in the year-ago period. As of Jun 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 46.3%. In the second quarter, MPC repurchased $3.1 billion of shares and a further $800 million worth of shares in July. The company currently has a remaining authorization of $6.3 billion.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $562 million on capital programs (43% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 48% on the Midstream segment) compared to $577 million in the year-ago period.

Shares have lost about 6.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Molson Coors due for a breakout?

However, both metrics improved year over year. Results have gained from the strong performance across its portfolio and both business units.Quarterly DetailsThe company’s adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share jumped 50% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63.Net sales grew 12% to $3,267 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,309 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 12.1%, driven by a favorable price and sales mix, and higher financial volume.Net sales per hectoliter increased 8.7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from the premiumization and geographic mix.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes rose 5% to 22.8 million, driven by strength in America, partially offset by the sluggishness in EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes advanced 2.8% to 23.4 million hectoliters due to higher volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) advanced 53% year over year to $502.2 million. On a constant-currency basis, EBT jumped 53% due to higher net pricing, rising financial volumes, increased pricing and a positive sales mix, somewhat offset by cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, as well as higher MG&amp;A expenses.Story continuesSegmental InformationAmericas: Net sales in the segment increased 10.7% to $2,621.7 million on a reported basis and rose 11.5% on a constant-currency basis, driven by a positive price and sales mix, as well as higher financial volume, partly offset by unfavorable currency. The metric came ahead of our estimate of $2,439.1 million. Financial volumes rose 5% year over year, driven by an increase in U.S. domestic shipments stemming from volume growth in its premium brands, as well as higher shipments inCanada.Brand volume for the segment increased 8% year over year on an 8.7% rise in the United States, owing to double-digit growth across Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet. Canada brand volumes rose 11.3%, driven by cycling the prior-year impacts of the Québec labor strike. Meanwhile, Latin America declined 5.9% due to industry softness in some major markets.Net sales per hectoliter rose 5.4% year over year due to a favorable sales and price mix, and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 40% on a constant-currency basis to $487.6 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing, rising financial volumes, lower logistics expenses and a favorable sales mix, offset by cost inflation on materials, conversion, and higher MG&amp;A expenses.EMEA&amp;APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) grew 16.3% to $649 million and improved 14.7% on a constant-currency basis, driven by a favorable price and sales mix, as well as favorable currency, partly offset by a decline in financial volume.

Net sales per hectoliter for the segment advanced 19.9%, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing, offset by currency headwinds.The segment’s financial volumes fell 3%, while the brand volume decreased 2.9% due to declines in Central and Eastern Europe, stemming from inflationary pressures, partially offset by resilient demand and growth in above premium volumes in the U.K.The segment’s underlying EBT increased 85% to a loss of $64.2 million on a reported basis and improved 83% on a constant-currency basis, driven by higher net pricing to customers, favorable sales mix, offset by lower financial volumes and cost inflation, particularly in materials, logistics and manufacturing expenses.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $960.9 million.

We will also look at the current trends contributing to slow economic growth in those countries and discuss the companies aiming to alleviate poverty. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to 10 Countries with the Worst Economies in the World in 2023.Interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and rising inflation, a number of countries had to bear the cost of pandemic in the face of setbacks in education, health, and income losses. According to the World Bank, there was an increase of about 70 million people living in extreme poverty, resulting in the global poverty rate reaching 9.3% in 2020. The official poverty rate of the US reached 11.4%, a 1.0% increase from 10.5% in 2019, the first yearly poverty increase following five consecutive decreases.The ongoing conflict of the Ukraine war and climate shocks have further hindered economic growth worldwide, with food and fuel prices skyrocketing. Considering the recent setbacks, nearly 7% of the world's population will still be living on less than $2.15 per day by 2030, as per the World Bank. Currently, Afghanistan has the lowest GDP growth rate in the world, whereas Ireland is the richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita as of 2023.In addition to impeding US economic development, the Ukraine war has also significantly impacted Europe's economic growth. The economic growth of 2023 was first predicted to increase by 1.2% but was later revised to 0.5% by the IMF. The predicted Global growth by the IMF is expected to decline to 2.7 percent in 2023 from 3.2 percent in 2022 and 6.0 percent in 2021. Except for the global financial crisis and the catastrophic period of the COVID-19 epidemic, this is the slowest growth profile since 2001.In 2021, with the pandemic hampering factory operations and economic growth globally, multiple companies observed shutdown of their retail stores or bankruptcy.Story continuesFor example, during the pandemic, the world's biggest athletic shoe maker, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales due to shipment challenges and a decline in physical store sales. Furthermore, due to supply chain disruptions, including US port congestion and global container shortages, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) experienced about a 10% drop in their revenue in North America in the three months to February 28, 2021. Despite witnessing challenges in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) addressed COVID-19 by maintaining healthy customer engagement and boosting online sales. Moreover, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) committed to $25 million, with more than $2 million in donations for employees, to provide global support for COVID-19 response initiatives. Speaking of the shoe business, you should check out our article on Most Cushioned Walking Shoes for Work. On the other hand, as a result of challenges like fluctuating demand and uncertain economy within the automotive market in South Africa, General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) ceased its local manufacturing and selling of Chevrolet Vehicles in the region back in 2017. General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) decided to exit the manufacturing market in South Africa mainly due to low exports and poor production. The premises permitted General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) to manufacture nearly 100,000 vehicles annually. However, only 34,000 vehicles were manufactured, with 2000-35000 vehicles exported in 2016. Moreover, the company’s attention inclined more towards financially rewarding countries like North America and China, as they wanted to primarily focus on producing autonomous cars. Hence, General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) decided to sell its operations to Isuzu Motors Ltd in South Africa.25 Countries with the Worst Economies in the World in 2023Anton_Ivanov/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023, we have employed GDP growth rate to rank the countries. To ensure that the following list of countries is accurately and fairly ranked, we have sourced the data of the GDP growth rate for the year 2022 for each of the following countries from the World Bank. For the countries with the same GDP growth rate, countries with the higher poverty rate were ranked higher. The list is presented in an ascending order which means countries with lower GDP growth rates have been ranked higher.Note: Since Afghanistan’s GDP growth rate for the years 2022 and 2023 was not available, we have ranked it according to its GDP growth rate in 2021.25. GuatemalaGDP growth rate: 4.1%As Central America's largest economy, Guatemala had a GDP per capita of around $5,025 as of 2022. However, nearly one-half of the children under the age of 5 face severe malnutrition, making it one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. Additionally, more than half of the population survives under the national poverty line with a poverty rate of 54%. It is one of the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023. 24. MozambiqueGDP growth rate: 4.1%Despite making significant progress in improving Mozambique's poverty rate i.e. 64.6%, the country continues to suffer extreme poverty, with nearly 80% of its total population reliant on surviving on less than $2 per day. However, the growth rate is expected to reach 6% during 2023-2025 due to progress in sectors like services, LNG production, and increased commodity prices.23. HondurasGDP growth rate: 4.0%Honduras is a lower-middle-income country, with around 60% of the population living in poverty. Despite being one of the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023, the economy has the full potential to accelerate its growth owing to its strategic location which has access to ample productive natural resources.22. EswatiniGDP growth rate: 3.9%Factors like high unemployment, continuous population growth, and unfair allocation of resources contribute to Eswatini’s deteriorating economy. As per the 2021 Labor Force Survey, the unemployment rate in the country stood over 33% in 2021, the highest in over a decade.21. MadagascarGDP growth rate: 3.8%According to the World Bank, Madagascar had a GDP worth $14.95 billion in 2022.

MaliGDP growth rate: 3.7%Mali is a landlocked country with one-half of the population facing poverty. Mali's economy is mostly focused on agriculture, with a predominantly rural population engaged in subsistence agriculture. It is one of the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023.19. Guinea-BissauGDP growth rate: 3.5%Guinea-Bissau is one of the coup-prone and politically unstable countries with a weak economy in the world. Despite having a very high natural wealth per capita, the country continues to suffer hindrances in its economic growth due to political turmoil and a lack of private sectors. Moreover, the country had a poverty rate of 21.8% in 2022.18. Sierra LeoneGDP growth rate: 3.5%Sierra Leone is one of the poorest economies, with a poverty rate of 26.1% and a GDP of $3.97 billion in 2022. According to the World Bank, investment in education provision and quality can help Sierra Leone grow its economy better by accessing more formal opportunities. It is also one of the least developed countries in the world in 2023. 17. ZimbabweGDP growth rate: 3.4%Zimbabwe’s economy is mainly a result of contributions in sectors like agriculture and mining. Issues like high inflation and elevated interest rates have been observed in the country lately. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 7.9 million Zimbabweans were affected by poverty due to economic losses.16. NigeriaGDP growth rate: 3.3%The deteriorating economy of Nigeria has resulted in millions of people being impacted by poverty.

GhanaGDP growth rate: 3.2%The GDP growth was slowed from 5.4% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022, resulting in slower growth for the agricultural and services sectors.

AngolaGDP growth rate: 3.0%Angola's economic fortunes have been linked to global oil demand, resulting in unstable growth and high levels of poverty and inequality.

ComorosGDP growth rate: 2.4%Comoros is among the world’s poorest and least developed economies. With a GDP of $1.24 billion as of 2022, the increase in global food and fuel prices has significantly impacted Comoros’s economy, with inflation reaching about 12.5% in 2022. It is one of the countries with the worst economies in the world in 2023.12. ChadGDP growth rate: 2.2%Chad, formerly an agricultural economy, joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003, and its economy has been heavily contingent on oil since then. The country’s economy continues to suffer because of political instability, security conflicts, and a lack of infrastructure.11. South AfricaGDP growth rate: 2.0%Although South Africa’s economy is the largest industrialized and technology-driven economy based upon private enterprises in Africa, economic growth has been hindered due to electricity and power shortages. Moreover, inflation and a decline in investment rates have also had a negative impact on the country’s economy.

The Purosangue is designed not as a copycat sports utility vehicle that many other luxury automakers sell, but as a true Ferrari car that their devoted fan base can use for more practical transportation needs. Since the average Ferrari is only driven a few thousand miles a year or less, they are best understood as mechanical works of art rather than a means of transportation. But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Best Mining Penny Stocks to Buy Now20 Biggest ETFs by Volume10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts Disclosure: None.

The contract expires at midnight Sep 14, 2023.Shawn Fain, president of UAW, said that 97% of voting members at General Motors GM, Ford Motor F and Stellantis STLA approved the authorization. Fain leads the union of about 150,000 workers.He added that the union is exploring a lot of options, but the extension of the contract is not one of them.President Joe Biden is concerned about the potential UAW strike and has emphasized his belief in the necessity of a situation where any lost job is promptly substituted with new employment opportunities. He further stressed the importance of ensuring the compensation for these new roles is fair and proportionate to the responsibilities they entail.Some senators are advocating for nationwide UAW agreements to encompass jobs associated with battery joint ventures. These joint ventures currently offer lower compensation and the senators are pushing for these roles to be included under the UAW's jurisdiction with terms that ensure higher wages and benefits.Per Fain, over the last two decades, workers have made numerous concessions, including giving up wage hikes, defined benefit pensions and post-retirement health care benefits. The UAW is determined to negotiate better terms, conditions and benefits for its members this year.The union is demanding an end to the tiered wage system that pays new hires less than veterans. Other demands include wage hikes of 46%, the restoration of cost-of-living allowances and defined-benefit pension plans for new workers and a reduction in the workweek duration.Per the union, more than half the workers in the automotive sector no longer have pensions. Currently, at Stellantis, only 30% of hourly U.S. workers qualify for defined benefit pensions.While listing the series of demands, Fain said that while the members of the union sat back for decades, these companies continued to exploit them.Fain believes that the Detroit Three carmakers can easily fulfill the contract terms, considering its profits over the past decade. He expects Detroit Three to come up with counter-proposals to the UAW demands next week.The impact of the strike on Detroit Three inventories is vague. Till July, Stellantis U.S. Ram, Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge each had over 100 days’ inventory, whereas other specific popular models had less.UAW members’ votes do not guarantee a strike. The right to call a strike is at the union’s disposal if the agreement is not reached by Sep 14.General Motors, Ford and Stellantis want a deal that is fair to workers and also provides the companies with flexibility. Per GM’s emailed statement, the automaker is working hard with the union and bargaining in good faith to make sure that it gets the agreement right for its team members, customers, suppliers, the community and the business.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CBS News Travel Editor Peter Greenberg reviews the travel conditions that could cause delays for major airline operators.""Three of the four major air traffic control centers are below their 85% staffing threshold,"" Greenberg says. ""That means even in the best of weather, they have to slow things down because they literally do not have enough controllers to work the number of flights the airline scheduled.""Greenberg comments on the price trends for international travel bookings as compared to domestic travel prices.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]AKIKO FUJITA: With Labor Day weekend fast approaching, millions of Americans are going to the skies and the roads. According to AAA, domestic bookings are up 4% and international bookings are up 44%. But after a rough start to the summer travel season, we have a look at whether travelers may be in for a similar fate.Joining us now is CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg. Peter, we've got the FAA predicting this is going to be the third busiest holiday weekend. How smooth are things going to look?PETER GREENBERG: Well, you know what? Whether or not withstanding, demand is actually starting to decrease. People are starting to stay home a little more because they couldn't afford the airfares. They couldn't afford the hotel rates. So you're seeing airfares right now down about 11% from where they were about two weeks ago. And that's a good sign leading into the fall.Now having said that, this is the last big hurrah weekend for the year leading into Thanksgiving. So people will be on the road. They will be taking to the skies. It's the usual chaos because all year long, it's not really seasonal. Flights have been full. Airports have been crowded and sometimes overcrowded.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And for many consumers, the southwest meltdown that we saw in December, still top of mind. We also had multiple delays this summer amid pilot and other labor shortages. What does that mean for this weekend and looking beyond into the back half of the year when it comes to some of those potential disruptions?Story continuesPETER GREENBERG: Well, beyond pilot shortages and computer meltdowns, you've got a lingering problem with the FAA. Three of the four major air traffic control centers are below their 85% staffing threshold, which means even in the best of weather, they have to slow things down because they literally do not have enough controllers to work the number of flights the airlines have scheduled.So you can expect delays just on that alone, then you throw weather in. So let's just hope there's not any weather. It'll just be slow.AKIKO FUJITA: Now, Peter, you mentioned that we're already starting to see some consumers pull back from their travel plans this time of year. What does that suggest in terms of how things are going to look come holiday season? That is another big driver for so many of these airlines.PETER GREENBERG: It is. But we have to go back to the COVID days, where so many of us came up close and personal with our own sense of personal mortality and made a decision that we were going to forego expensive material goods and new cars and clothing and jewelry. We wanted to focus on buying experiences.So all that money that was saved up during COVID was spent on that. Here's the problem. We've blown through those savings and now we're putting it on our credit cards, as you've already reported numerous times, I suspect. Consumer credit debt on credit cards is over $1 trillion.So part of that weakening and demand is because people are getting their credit card bills at 24% interest and trying to reassess what their priorities really are.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And amid a lot of those higher prices is there anything the consumer can do to try and score better deals?PETER GREENBERG: Yes, the good news is, as demand is falling, we're now starting to see drastic reductions in international affairs. Just about a month ago, a round trip ticket from New York to London in Coach was about $2,200. That's crazy. Today, I'm seeing fares starting now, not just waiting for Labor Day, down to $208 each way. And that includes taxes and fees. That's a remarkable change.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Peter, you know, we've heard so much from these airlines about the strength they're seeing in international travel versus domestic. What are you seeing going into this weekend? Where are travelers going?PETER GREENBERG: Well, most of them are not going internationally. They're coming back from their foreign vacations. Most of them are staying home close to home because of school seasons and having to start the season after Labor Day. But if you want to be a smart traveler, now's the time book international flights. As I said, that $208 example I gave you is just one of them.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. I'll have to get some notes there on where to travel internationally. CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Air Canada (ACDVF). ACDVF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.Investors should also note that ACDVF holds a PEG ratio of 0.20. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ACDVF's industry currently sports an average PEG of 0.24. Over the last 12 months, ACDVF's PEG has been as high as 0.21 and as low as 0.20, with a median of 0.20.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ACDVF has a P/S ratio of 0.4. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.45.Finally, investors will want to recognize that ACDVF has a P/CF ratio of 3.65.

230,c764c56c-b126-3f83-a2bf-14db1eff1fe2,UAL,2023-09-01,Busy Labor Day Weekend Awaits US Airlines: 3 Stocks to Watch,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/busy-labor-day-weekend-awaits-121000635.html,1693483800,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL']","[It is a well-documented fact that air travel demand has bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows. Driven by the buoyant passenger volumes in the current summer season, which has been the busiest one ever, the upcoming Labor Day holiday period is expected to be a very busy one for U.S. airlines.The bullish expectation of the Transportation Security Administration or TSA pertaining to traffic volumes during the Labor Day holiday weekend further highlights the encouraging scenario. Therefore, we believe that investors interested in the industry would do well to keep U.S. airline stocks like United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Delta Air Lines DAL on their radar.With people taking to the skies in a big way in the post-COVID period, the airline industry, one of the hardest hit corners in the pandemic peak, is currently in good shape. Driven by the concept of ‘Revenge travel’, a term emanating from the prolonged periods of lockdown, people remain eager to undertake a flight despite headwinds like flight disruptions caused by labor shortages. Revenge travel highlights a strong desire to travel in response to the monotony and exhaustion of life caused by the COVID-19-induced lockdown.Driven by the travel surge, the Federal Aviation Administration expects the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend to be the third busiest one in 2023 so far, after the Juneteenth weekend, which was inclusive of Father's Day, and the break for Presidents Day.The TSA’s ProjectionThe TSA anticipates screening more than 14 million passengers in the Sep 1-Sep 6 period, despite the likely disruptions caused by the tropical storm Idalia. The busiest day during the period is likely to be Sep 1. On that day, TSA expects to screen more than 2.7 million travelers passing through security checkpoints.Per TSA administrator David Pekoske, “We anticipate this Labor Day holiday weekend will be busy, with passenger volumes nearly 11% higher than last year, volumes that already exceeded 2019 Labor Day holiday travel volumes.”Story continuesHighlighting the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, the TSA stated that it has screened approximately 227.5 million passengers since the Memorial Day weekend. This translates into an average of 2.5 million per day. To aid travel, many U.S. airlines are offering low fares for passengers who book their travel by Labor Day.Given this rosy scenario, we have highlighted three airline stocks, that investors should keep tabs on.Our ChoicesUnited Airlines: UAL is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and international air travel demand. Anticipating to be extremely busy over the Labor Day holiday period, UAL’s management expects that nearly 2.8 million passengers will travel by its flights in the Aug 31-Sep 5 period.Riding on the buoyant air traffic scenario, UAL shares have gained 32.9% year to date. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other occasion. The average beat was 17.2%. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereAmerican Airlines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. To meet the anticipated demand swell over the Aug 31-Sep 5 period, AAL aims to operate approximately 32,000 flights during this period. The carrier expects that nearly 3.5 million passengers will travel by its flights in the above timeframe.AAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the last four quarters, with an average of 19.2%. AAL shares have gained 16.1% year to date.Delta Air Lines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is likely to aid Delta in attracting significant traffic during the Labor Day holiday period.DAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other two occasions. The average beat was 2.1%. DAL shares have gained 31.5% year to date.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Regional banks, including PNC Financial Services PNC, Citizens Financial Group CFG, Zions Bancorporation ZION and Fifth Third Bancorp FITB, are among those that will come under new, stringent rules. This will bring these banks in line with the larger ones like JPMorgan JPM, which already have their own set of requirements.Martin Gruenberg, the FDIC chairman, noted that the regional banking crisis indicated that smaller mid-sized banks, too, need tougher rules, and requiring those to issue more debt will act as a cushion against potential losses. It is estimated that the FDIC incurred losses of about $30 billion following the seizures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.Per the FDIC, the proposal, if implemented, would see banks raise their long-term debt issuances by almost 25%. Gruenberg added that issuing such debt is likely to “marginally increase funding costs"" and may lead to net interest margin contraction by nearly three basis points.Banks, including PNC, CFG, ZION, FITB and JPM, are already struggling to keep funding costs down. This is putting pressure on their balance sheet and making it difficult to earn solid profits. Hence, these new proposals are expected to lead to higher funding costs.The comments on all three proposals are due by Nov 30, 2023.Notably, the issuance of long-term debt proposal will have “a three-year phase-in period and would also allow certain outstanding long-term debt to count toward the minimum requirements to provide banks with a reasonable period to transition to the required characteristics of eligible long-term debt instruments.”Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards.""A Positive Earnings Trend EmergesNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook beginning to improve in recent months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing.This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared 'earnings cliff' narrative.Q2 was the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines. The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -1.5% on +0.7% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT in recent days, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2's weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Unlike Walmart, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Story continuesWalmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.While Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 98.4% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -1.5%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn't show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn't leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management's guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for CSX Is CSX Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.50bUS$3.77bUS$3.75bUS$3.88bUS$3.99bUS$4.09bUS$4.19bUS$4.29bUS$4.38bUS$4.48bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.56%Est @ 2.44%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.29%Est @ 2.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.2%) = US$83bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$83b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$39bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$66b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$30.2, the company appears about fair value at a 8.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CSX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.107. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CSXStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best September Dividend Stocks To Buy.Dividend investing is a popular way to increase your earnings and generate income through investments. While it might appear straightforward to invest in stocks that pay dividends, this strategy actually involves various other aspects to consider. One approach within dividend investing is the dividend capture strategy. It involves buying a stock just before its ex-dividend date and then selling it shortly after, once the dividend has been paid. The goal is to capture the dividend payout without necessarily holding onto the stock for the long term.Investors who prefer a more active approach might find the dividend capture strategy suitable, as it involves relatively short holding periods. This can be appealing to those who don't want to commit to long-term investments. However, dividend investing offers benefits in the long run as they have the potential for capital appreciation over time. Dividends have contributed significantly to the market’s overall returns. A study by Hartford Funds revealed that from 1930 to 2019, dividends on average made up about 42% of the total returns each year. This is a yearly average of 1.8%.Another report by Wisdom Tree also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the past. According to the report, dividends played a substantial role in the S&amp;P 500's annual total returns of 10.4%, contributing almost 30%. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade when the S&amp;P 500 had negative overall returns. During this time, dividend returns of around 2% acted as a buffer, helping to counterbalance the negative price returns caused by the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis.When investing in dividend stocks, companies that regularly grow their dividends remain on investors’ radars. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks in this regard as these companies have a history of steadily raising their dividend payments for many years.Story continues10 Best September Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list presents the dividend capture strategy for choosing prominent dividend stocks scheduled to go ex-dividend in September 2023.

Please go ahead.Story continuesDarren MercerThank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. I am pleased to welcome you to today's second-quarter 2023 financial results conference call.Despite the challenges we've encountered over the past few months, namely the short seller attack in June, significant devaluation of Nigeria's currency following the lifting of certain foreign exchange restrictions, a period of economic stagnation in Nigeria following the government elections in February of 2023, and subsequently changes with presidential administrations in May, I am delighted with our progress and achievements over the past three months and extremely excited about our prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond.For those of you joining us for the first time, I would like to take a moment to introduce Tingo Group. Tingo Group is a diverse fintech and agri-fintech group of companies, with operations in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Middle East. We significantly expanded on somewhat transformed the company when we acquired 100% of Tingo Mobile Ltd. on November 30, 2022, and then acquired Tingo Foods Plc on February 7, 2023, before subsequently changing our name to Tingo Group on February 27, 2023.As of today, the Tingo Group is comprised of the following businesses. Tingo Mobile, which is a leading fintech and agri-fintech business in Africa. It operates through device-as-a-service and smartphone USSD platform model. Tingo Foods, which uptakes crops from the Tingo Mobile substantial and growing customer base of farmers and processes those crops into finished food and beverage products. Tingo DMCC, which operates a commodity trading platform on export business from the Dubai Multi Commodity Center and deals in both more agricultural commodities from our Tingo Mobile farmers and finished good products in Tingo Foods.TingoPay. We had developed and recently begins to operate a beta version of the TingoPay Super-App, supported by our Pan-African partnership with Visa. The full version of TingoPay, which will be rolled out later this year, provides payment services and e-wallet in the range of value-added services to customers. TingoPay in partnership with Visa also offers a range of merchant services to businesses.We also have a number of fintech verticals that have today being focused on the Southeast Asian market. Within the past few months, however, we focus on maximizing shareholder value and leveraging the most profitable and value parts of the Tingo Group, we are currently restructuring this part of the business and winding down or disposing of any operations that do not achieve our target contribution metrics. Our group of businesses and synergistic ecosystem they create, places us in a remarkable position from which we can expand both in our current markets and internationally and deliver significant further growth.Despite the challenges I mentioned earlier, which we believe are temporary on short-term issues that will ultimately benefit the company in the long term, we achieved quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the second quarter of 14.8%. What is important to note is that this was against the backdrop of a 66.3% devaluation of Nigeria's currency during the second quarter, and a period of economic stagnation in Nigeria following governments election and subsequent change in presidential administrations.It is worth noting the significant devaluation in Nigeria's currency occurred as a result of the Central Bank of Nigeria's removal of foreign exchange restrictions, which we believe will deliver significant long-term benefits to our business, including the acceleration of the dollarization of our business and making our export and commodity trading activities more profitable.Furthermore, once the policies of Nigeria's new government have been fully implemented, we do expect Nigeria's currency to appreciate and this economy to rebound strongly, which should be hugely beneficial to the company and our shareholders.Following the completion of our acquisition of Tingo Mobile on November 30, 2022, we have been highly profitable and continued to grow strongly since, including through the subsequent acquisition of Tingo Foods and the commencement of export trades through Tingo DMCC. We have also achieved organic growth, including through our partnership with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria and our launch into Ghana. This growth is set to continue following the delivery of 6 million new handsets that we plan to distribute new AFAN customers.Our financial results highlights for the group is shown on this slide. Once again, all representative of our strong financial performance since the completion of our acquisition of Tingo Mobile on November 30, 2022, and our subsequent acquisition of Tingo Foods.For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company generated over USD977 million in revenue, USD346 million in gross profit, USD283 million in EBITDA, and nearly USD182 million in income before tax. Furthermore, our high levels of operational cash flow enabled us to invest just under USD1 billion in the quarter on purchasing 6 million mobile phone handsets for distribution to new customers and on inventory payments for both Tingo Food and Tingo DMCC businesses.Slide 5, our mission. As mentioned previously, our reason why Tingo Group is very important to us, for those of you that have listened to or read our presentation are most likely already aware of our mission statements.For those of you not familiar, our overarching mission at Tingo Group is to foster digital and financial inclusion through our fintech platforms and to drive social and economic upliftment. In our agri-fintech businesses, our mission includes our commitment to make a significant difference in improving global food supply and tackling the world's food security crisis by delivering farmer empowerment, improved crop yields, a reduction in post-harvest losses, and better access to both foreign and domestic markets. At a regional level, we also aim to support Africa and its farmers to achieve sustainable food self-sufficiency, bringing an end to Africa's food insecurity and poverty.Slide 6, acquisition and recent developments. By way of a recap, we entered into a merger agreement to acquire Tingo Mobile on May 10, 2022. Following this, we immediately appointed a team of some of the world's largest and most reputable professional advisors to undertake extensive due diligence and financial analysis. Amongst others, the team included Big 4 accounting firm; a number-one US law firm who's the largest in Africa; and as I said, other professional advisers too.We announced on June 15, 2022, the due diligence exercise had been completed and that the findings were positive with no material concerns. The original merger agreement was amended and restated in October of 2022 to facilitate the expedited acquisition of 100% of Tingo Mobile, as well as an improvement in the terms for the company's shareholders. The acquisition was subsequently completed on November 30, 2022.With the benefits of the companies and Tingo Mobile's collaboration, the fourth quarter of 2022 mark the beginning of the geographical expansion of Tingo Mobile with the opening of offices in Ghana, Malawi, and Dubai. The fourth quarter also saw and launched the Tingo DSCC commodities trading platform and export business. And a soft launch of the beta version of the TingoPay Super App in partnership with Visa.By January of 2023, we began to pivot the company's insurance and fintech verticals to better complement the Tingo businesses with the goal of leveraging its already established brands and larger customer base. Then on February 7, 2023, we acquired the Tingo Foods and beverage processing business to further strengthen the Tingo seed-to-sale ecosystem.Also on November 27, 2023, we changed our corporate name and ticker symbol to better reflect the importance of the Tingo brands to the business and provide improved clarity to our external stakeholders, including current and prospective partners, customers, and investors.Our reporting of full 2022 financial results on March 31, 2023 was followed in April by the announcements of Tingo Mobile exclusive partnership agreement with PCX and AFAN. On May 30th, we completed our first commodity export trades through Tingo DMCC, marking a major milestone in our strategy to dollarize the company's net earnings.Lastly, earlier today, we announced the commencement of a quarterly dividend, payable to the holders of both our common stock and Series B convertible preferred shares on the adoption of a dividend policy. The first dividend payments has provisionally been agreed in the amounts of USD20 million, which we aim to set the record date for as soon as practicable and all classified as relating to our second-quarter results.Dozy MmobuosiBy way of the recap and updates on the Tingo Mobile business that I founded about 22 years ago, we'll begin with the Tingo Mobile business as a service model and then more so, NWASSA agri-fintech platform, which we believe is a leading agri-fintech platform in Africa. Following the signing of the definitive merger agreement with MICT in October of 2022, we set about accelerating growth strategy.In November and December 2022, we signed cleared agreements with two major partners with the aim of quickly expanding Tingo Mobile's customer base from 9.3 million to unexpected 30 million. We signed a partnership with signed a partnership with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, which included a commitment to enroll a minimum of 20 million new customers to Tingo Mobile. We also launched in Ghana and sign it with agreement with Kingdom of Ashanti, which concluded a commitment to enroll a minimum of 2 million new customers to Tingo Mobile, on the target goal of enrolling more than 4 million new customers.Soon afterwards, we launched into Malawi and have made progress towards several partnerships, with the goal of establishing a base to rollout in the future across the East Africa, including Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia. Looking further ahead, we plan to expand in the future into other parts of Africa as well as into Asia and other advanced markets in the world. Through our businesses within the Tingo family, mainly Tingo Foods and Tingo DMCC, we aim to increase offtake and demand for produce from Tingo Mobile's farmers, thereby treating with ourselves for enforcement cycle.In April 2023, as part of the further strengthening of our ecosystem, Tingo Mobile entered into a tripartite agreement at PCX and AFAN, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Lastly, as we look to expand the reach of our North America platform, we are making good progress in testing and further developing the forthcoming NWASSA web platform and NWASSA app, which we intend to launch later this year to complement the already successful years of the GSM platform.Darren MercerSlide 8, Tingo Foods. Tingo Food was acquired by the group on February 7, 2023. This is a business of Dozi Mmobousi have been developing for some time outside of Tingo Mobile. Tingo Foods is launched as a standalone company in September of 2022, focusing on supplying a relatively small range of products to several large distribution and wholesale businesses. Tingo Foods creates significant demand and offtake with Tingo Mobile's farmers, while at the same time creating supply with Tingo DMCC's commodity trading and export business.In the first five months of trading since we acquired Tingo Foods Plc in February of 2023, the businesses generated revenues of USD983.7 million and delivered an operating profit of USD203.8 million. The US dollar conversion of the revenues and earnings and Tingo Foods was adversely impacted by the significant devaluation of Nigeria's currency against the US dollar in June of 2023, when the Central Bank of Nigeria removed certain foreign exchange restrictions. We believe that these actions will ultimately be beneficial for the company, including helping to accelerate the dollarization of the business and for the growth and profit margins of our export business.The Tingo Foods business was also impacted by the economic stagnation in Nigeria that ensued around the time of the change in presidential administration, which resulted in several customer delaying orders. Tingo Foods is set to multiply capacity and revenue for the new state-of-the-art USD1.6-billion-food processing facility in the Delta State of Nigeria. Our joint venture construction partner has confirmed the project is on track to enabled Tingo Food to commence processing operations on-site by mid-2024.On February 22, 2023, Tingo Foods signed a partnership with Evtec Energy Plc, to build a USD150-million, 110-megawatt solar plant to power the facility, which aim is to achieve net zero carbon emissions and deliver reduce energy costs. We believe Africa's farmers and agricultural sector will benefit from the significant expansion of the continent's own processing capabilities, increasing crop demand, reducing post-harvest losses, ensuring fairer selling prices for farmers, and delivering financial upliftment.Slide 9, Tingo DMCC agri-commodity platform. In December 2022, we launched Tingo DMCC, which is an agricultural commodity platform and export business in partnership with the Dubai Multi Commodity Center or DMCC. As part of achieving our ecosystem, Tingo DMCC was already becoming a significant source of offtake of raw crops from Tingo Mobile's farmers and is also expected to be a major customer of Tingo Foods in the future as it looks to export their finished food and beverage products.Having spent several months working with AFAN, our farmers is on the aggregation of both volumes and produce, we completed our first export trades on May 30, 2023 and delivered USD348 million of export revenues in the second quarter through the farmers of Nigeria, which are estimated to total around 60 million. And with the addition of Ghana, Malawi, and certain other territories in the future, we now have access to several billion US dollars per annum of agricultural produce for our export business.Furthermore, our exclusive partnership with PCX and AFAN, which strengthens our supply chain and goods-handling capabilities and gives us priority access to PCX commodity trading platform, is already proven to be valuable as we develop the business and build a strong foundation. The Tingo DMCC export business is expected to dollarize and globalize Tingo Group, whilst at the same time providing Tingo Mobile's farmers and Tingo Foods' direct access to international markets.Slide 10, PCX and AFAN. On April 26, 2023, it was announced that Tingo Mobile had partnered with PCX and AFAN, for the exclusive use of AFAN's existing network of 2,322 warehouses across Nigeria for a minimum term of 30 years. This strategic partnership uniquely positioned Tingo to monetize Nigeria's crop ecosystem across this population of 213 million and the global export markets.Under the terms of the agreements, Tingo Mobile has the rights of first refusal to purchase or trade any of the produce stored in the AFAN warehouses, which intends to use primarily to serve the Tingo Foods' food processing business and the Tingo DMCC commodity trading and export business.PCX has installed its leading-edge e-warehouse receipt system in all of the partnership's warehouses, enabling crops and other produce to be commoditized and traded by Tingo from the date of delivery. Tingo Mobile is also to be granted a priority position on the PCX commodity trading platform, enabling Tingo DMCC to trade farming produce under the commodities on spot, futures, physical, and the derivative basis.AFAN, umbrella body for Nigeria's farming sector, has committed to coordinate all of its agricultural cooperatives and members to utilize the partnership's warehouses to handle their produce. In addition, the partnership has committed to a targeted increase in the number of warehouses to 80,000 over the next few years. Tingo Mobile also has the right to sublet the warehouse space to pre-approve third parties, such as e-commerce businesses and wholesale businesses.As mentioned previously, this partnership with AFAN and PCX is expected to considerably increase our offtake of crops and other properties from farmers, which we believe will help to satisfy a substantial future input requirements of our food processing and commodity trading and export business. Importantly, the agreements also further augments our seed-to-sale model, helping us to achieve our objectives of reducing post-harvest losses, crop wastage, whilst also increasing food production levels and meaningfully improving food security.Dozy MmobuosiFor those of you joining us for the first time, TingoPay, which is currently being tested in beta version is super app that have a full range of value-added services and partnership with Visa. Such services include digital Visa card, e-wallet payment services, marketplace, e-commerce, insurance and finance. As a full market, B2C and B2B offering, the TingoPay Super App and Visa partnership is helping us to diversify and expanding into new sectors, with the aim of making TingoPay and also Tingo household names as widely recognized as Visa itself. To assist us in achieving market penetration, our Pan-Africa partnership with Visa includes the provision of marketing and customer acquisition support.As I mentioned, all business sectors will benefit from a new range of Tingo-Visa merchant services, and TingoPay business puddle and smaller farmer customers will see significant additional advantages through the integration of TingoPay with our NWASSA agri marketplace platform. The TingoPay business partner and Tingo-Visa merchant services enable subscribers, farmers, and businesses in all sector to easily and securely accept payments and to make online transactions in the domestic or foreign currencies, as well as to manage the card's setup for recurring impairments and access transactional shipments.The test of the beta version of the TingoPay app is progressing well as the technical development team is constantly making improvements ahead of its rollout. Such improvements include the addition of new functions and several new value-added services. Our current target is to launch the full-scale TingoPay by the end of the third quarter.Darren MercerThe Tingo Mobile, Nwassa, TingoPay, Tingo Food, and Tingo DMCC, we have created a full agri-fintech ecosystem, which is at the very heart of our business. We communicate with the services to our farmers through the smartphone handsets we supply to them. The farmers can then use Nwassa to purchase inputs for their farming business, to purchase other services, to make payments, and to sell their produce.Tingo Foods forms an important part of the ecosystem for both the valuable customer and the source of offtake for Tingo Mobile's farmers, processing now raw crops into finished food and beverage products. Finally, Tingo DMCC is in a position to trade and export both the raw crops of Tingo Mobile farmers and the finish food and beverage products of Tingo Foods, which it is able to sell into a global market where demand significantly outstrip supply.This already strong seed-to-sale ecosystem is now strengthened further by the recently signed deal between Tingo Mobile, PCX, and AFAN. The partnership provides us access to a substantial nationwide network of warehouse facilities as well as securing a considerable increase in produce supply and offering those enhanced commodity trading opportunities.In total, the Tingo ecosystem creates a reinforcing loop, a financial and digital inclusion. alongside an increase in food supply and the reduction in post-harvest losses, which in turn improves food security and reduce poverty. Ultimately, these factors deliver financial and social investment not only to our farmers, but also to our stakeholders.Slide 13, environment, social and governance. At the center of everything we do, all our core values, and our commitment to our environmental, social, and governance goals. We fought digital and financial inclusion through our technology platforms, driving the social and economic upliftments of our customers. We meaningfully improve the global food supply and help tackle the world's food security crisis by empowering the farmer, helping them increase crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses, gain from improved access to markets, and benefit from fairer pricing.Our technology and platforms also deliver significant environmental benefits, reducing crop wastage, improving farming and food production efficiency, promoting sustainable farming techniques, and reducing freight miles. As part of our commitment towards the environment and social investment, we are focused on adopting a mature ESG framework underpin and guided by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.I will now turn the call over to Tingo Group's CFO, Kevin Chen, to discuss our second-quarter 2023 financial results as reported in this morning's 10-Q filing.Kevin ChenThank you, Darren.

We are fast growth and highly profitable Nasdaq-listed company, having generated revenues of USD1.83 billion and earnings before interest tax, depreciation, amortization of USD655.3 million in the first half of 2023.We have a strong balance sheet and our operations are significantly cash flow positive. Earlier today, we announced the commencement of a quarterly dividend payments. We have a high growth, high margin, and sticky revenue model with low customer acquisition cost and lower attrition. We have a full agri and food ecosystem from seed to sale, creating a virtuous circle for both us and our customers.Our food processing and commodity export business has a vast potential, and we are making a difference towards addressing the global food shortage and food security crises, and we are a benefactor of price inflation. Our Visa-Tingo partnership and TingoPay Super App are well positioned to expand Tingo significantly into new B2C and B2B markets.We have proven proprietary fintech platform, which are replicable in new geographical markets and new sectors. We have a vast addressable global market. And we believe we have a significant ESG impact that can grow considerably further in the future.Thank you, everybody. Operator, my colleagues and I from Tingo are now ready to take questions from the participants.Question and Answer SessionOur first question asked, congratulations on another strong quarter and the initiation of a dividend program, which I am delighted to see. You mentioned that you would expect a significant increase in the level of dividend payment in third quarter, which is also great to hear. Can you explain more on this?Darren MercerYes, sure. As explained in our results, our CapEx and investment into inventory in Q2 was just under USD1 billion. And of course, added to which during the quarter we also paid out our annual tax on Tingo Mobile of have another circa $170 million. Having made all this investment in outlay last quarter, we can now expect the inventory we purchased to be converting back into cash and our export business to fund itself.So in addition, the 6 million mobile phones we also bought will begin to generate significant revenues and earnings. So when you take all of that into account, and the growth that we expect to deliver in our export business, we expect to be able to significantly increase our dividend payments in Q3 and then again in Q4, and hopefully, with increases in each quarter thereafter.It should be remembered that with the new significant number of handsets being deployed from as early as next month, that those phones will in turn generate very significant revenues on the additional contribution to group profits almost immediately. So in short, yes, we expect significant increase in dividend from Q3 onwards. And yes, it's the aim of the company to deliver quarter-on-quarter dividend increases.Thank you, team. The next question asks, while the results are once again very impressive indeed, clearly the floating of the Naira and its devaluation has had a material impact on the results when converted into US dollars. What long-term impact, if any, do you foresee on the company as a result of the new exchange rate going forward?Darren MercerYes, it's a very good question. I think the first thing to point out is that the Nigerian government's new foreign exchange policy now means that the Naira of earnings that we have are now much more readily exchangeable into US dollars. And this means that from this moment forward, our company can now value its Naira cash balance as a liquid US dollar equivalent asset. And furthermore, any valuation discount that was previously applied against our Naira earnings can now be removed.Whilst the current devaluation has some negative impacts on the existing Tingo Mobile revenues, the benefits of a freely exchangeable currency is something that we strongly believe outweighed the negatives. And as for those negatives, they may be short term in nature anyway, particularly given the new economic policies of Nigeria's government. There's much talk about the Naira recovering large parts of lost ground in valuation terms over the coming months ahead.Furthermore, if I turn to other parts of the business, there are some notable immediate benefits that the devaluation of the Naira brings. I mean, in particular, in connection with our export business, where the price of the produce we purchased from Nigeria is significantly reduced. And as such, our produce now has a key price and competitive advantage over produce from other parts of the world. And we're already now seeing the benefits of this. And I'm sure that in the future, as we go forward and as we report future quarters numbers, we very much believe that we will see noticeable increases in our margin of export produce.Thank you, team. The next question asks, I believe it was a major development for Tingo's prospects and valuation when Nigeria's new president and its central bank removed certain foreign exchange restrictions on the Naira, especially bearing in mind that these longstanding restrictions had detrimentally affected the country's economy and investment appeal for so long. Can you comment further on what the lifting of the restrictions means for the company and us as shareholders?Darren MercerYeah. Look, I think I've covered much of that in the previous answer. But again, I think for the benefit of all of our shareholders, we should recognize that for the first time since we acquired Tingo Mobile and Tingo Foods, for the first time we are now able to readily apply to convert our Naira cash balances and earnings into US dollars.Naturally, we need to achieve the right balance of reinvesting a portion of our earnings into further growth and acceleration of the business, just as you've seen us do in Q2. But we can now also commence to distribute a meaningful portion of our earnings to shareholders as dividends. And I think we've demonstrated that with the initiation of our dividend program today.Thank you, team. The next question asked. The press release statement talks about the purchase of 6 million new phones for AFAN's farmers. I'm interested to know if AFAN already has the demand for these phones, or will it take time to deploy them and start to generate the related earnings? Also, what level of earnings and profitability can we expect from the phones?Darren MercerQuite a lot to answer that. Does AFAN has demand for 6 million new phones? Yeah, absolutely. In fact, they have considerable pen up demand, which means that as soon as we can source more handsets, they can be distributed almost immediately. And it's not just we have demand through AFAN in Nigeria, but also through the Ashanti Investment Trust in Ghana. We also have considerable demand too.As to when they'll be deployed. Well, I mentioned it earlier, AFAN and Tingo will start the process as soon as the phones are delivered. And the great thing is that as soon as those phones are delivered to the customer, they start to generate revenue. Not just from the lease payments, but also through the value-added services that we offer on the USSD platform.Of course with the platform, we earn commissions or fees straight away on the transactions that customers make over the platform, and that includes anything from direct time top up through the commissions on arranging loans and insurance and even commissions on the agricultural sales and farming inputs.And to the revenues on those phones. Well, at the current exchange rate, the typical average revenue per user or ARPU per farmer is between $6 and $6.50 a month, of which typically $3 comes or circa $3 comes from the lease elements and the balance comes from the NWASSA platform.Now, to give you an idea of what the margin is on those sales, on the $3 of lease payments, we are looking at around a 30% margin. And on the $3.50 or thereabouts, so there was the contribution, we're looking at a 98% margin. And so, we're looking at revenues per handset of an excessive $6 and over $4 of what would be gross profit on each of those handsets per month.So not only are these handsets very profitable in their own right, they also connect us to more farmers. And as we look to achieve significant farmers in our platform again through AFAN and Ashanti and whoever, and we look to grow that number towards the $30 million by the year end, we'll now also gain access to considerably more produce. And that produce in turn will support our export business as well as Tingo Foods. I have to say we're really proud of this business model.Thank you, team. The next question asks, through today's announcement of the purchase of a further 6 million phones, am I correct in thinking that will take your total number of phones to around 15 million and that you then have another 3 million or so farmers on the NWASSA platform that use their phones? And are there any further plans to increase the number of farmers on your platform beyond the 18 million?Darren MercerYeah, the short answer I guess is yes and yes. And once the 6 million new mobile phone handsets are delivered to farmers, it will take our number of farmers to around 18 million or so. But I can tell you, and I think we said it today on one or two occasions, that our goal is to increase the number of farmers on our platform to 30 million or so by the end of this year. Now, the plans to do this are through our partnership with AFAN in Nigeria who've committed to add 20 million new farmers to the platform, and our partnership with the Ashanti Investment Trust in Ghana, who themselves are committed to add between 2 million and 4 million new farmers this year.I think for those of you who aren't aware who AFAN are or who AFAN is, this is the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, which is the umbrella body that sits above all of these 56 agriculture and commodity cooperatives in Nigeria. Now, they have a remit from the Nigerian government to ultimately enroll all of the 60 million or so farmers in Nigeria and develop and modernize the country's agricultural sector. And so they're doing this by improving access to better farming inputs, providing education, delivering access to finance, and so on.And it's their partnership with us, which is most valuable, and which is really focused on making those initiatives a reality. And we're already making a real difference, which in turn we are seeing through results increasing in crop yields, food production levels, and of course reducing post-harvest losses. I mean, I believe such as the extent of our impact that we're not only helping Nigeria's farmers feed their own country, but it's through the initiatives that we have with AFAN, which help us put us in a position to export significant or larger quantities of produce through the rest of continental Africa and to other parts of the world.Thank you, team. From today's results, I can see that the export business of Tingo has generated significant revenues in the first quarter of trading. Is this level of growth sustainable and do you have access to enough produce to satisfy demand?Darren MercerYes, that's a very good question. I think I said earlier the impacts of the liberation of the exchange rate controls will only make Nigeria's produce even more attractive in international markets. And with our partnerships with AFAN and Ashanti, we aim to fully capitalize on the opportunity we have in front of us.Success in this area will deliver a significant increase in income to our farmers. And the benefit is, of course, in AFAN, that enables them to invest more into their land and their farming inputs, increasing their crop yields and production levels, and thereby creating more produce for us to buy from them. And this is illustrative really of the strength of our ecosystem and the virtuous circle or loop that it creates.The partnership we signed with AFAN and the Prime Commodity Exchange, or PCX, as you've seen as we refer to it, really enhances and strengthens our position and our ability to grow our export business. Not only does the partnership give us unrightful logistics and goods handling capabilities in Nigeria, but it also gives us improved access to huge quantities of produce and prime access to the PCX commodity trading platform, which is one of only a number of small commodity exchanges in Nigeria.With more than 12 million farmers currently in our platform, and with 6 million about to be added, rising to 13 million by year end, our access to substantial quantities of produce, again, puts us in a strong position to grow this area to grow our export business and capitalize on the ever-increasing global demand. I think the final point I'll make on this subject is that, at the beginning of June, we made a small announcement that we'd agreed to a loan facility arrangement with AFAN, which will be made available to their farmers and passed on to their farmers to enable them to cultivate new farming land and increase food production levels.I think for people to understand why we did that. As we're all too aware, it's very important for a farmer to know that he or she has reliable access to credit or funding. to enable them to purchase the inputs they needed for their farming. Now historically, the Nigerian government would pledge loans to the farming communities, but more often than not, these loans turned up rather late. Now, the impact of that was that the money came in too late for the farmer to be inside to plant their harvest. And now, of course, we have to bear in mind that crops are seasonal.So the program that we've introduced today in partnership with AFAN overcomes that issue. It ensures the farmers receive the necessary funding and at the appropriate time. And so that all the inputs they purchase are the right ones to grow the right crops for that particular land and the specific conditions that are prevalent from that location.So with this first loan facility, which we intend to do much more of, we are now able to ensure that thousands of acres of new farming land are cultivated, and thousands of additional metric tons of crops are produced each season. So this not only has a huge positive impact in the lives of the farmers, obviously, but also it further increases the levels of produce that we can access and significantly strengthens our supply chain.So look, when you put all of these things together, I think we're in a very strong position. And as you can see from the statement today, $340 million-plus of revenues in the export division in Q2, rising, we believe, to $1 billion or more of revenue per quarter before the end of this year.Thank you, team. Our next question asks, you reported export sales in your Q2 results of USD348 million, and that you expect that to increase to USD1 billion per quarter in Q3. Are you able to tell us what parts of the world you are now exporting to?Darren MercerYeah. The exports we transacted in Q2 were to other countries in Africa. And whilst we will continue to make exports within the African continent, we're also expanding into other parts of the world, including, primarily including in the Middle East, where demand significantly outstrips local supply.I think I said earlier that the competitive cost of our produce now, given the devaluation of the Naira, is opening up a number of new markets tours in other parts of the world.Thank you, team. The next question asks, can you explain in more detail the reason for the significant reduction in the company's cash balance at June 30th, compared to the previous two quarters? My own expectation was actually to see a further increase in cash.Darren MercerWell, that's a question I'm sure most people are interested in. Look, we touched on the explanation already, but I agree. I think it's worth going into a bit more detail.As Kevin mentioned just a short while ago in his presentation, our investments in outlay into capital expenditure and inventory during Q2 was approaching $1 billion, of which $460 million was spent approximately on the new mobile phone handsets, and more than $500 million was spent on inventory payments to support both Tingo Foods and our export business. And let's not forget on top of that, we also paid out about $170 million of tax in April on the Tingo Mobile profits of 2022.But as Kevin pointed out, whilst cash reserves fell to a little over $50 million at the quarter end, which by the way would've equated close to $90 million on the old exchange rate, our receivables and the export deals are loan amounted to almost $350 million on the balance sheet. Now all of that flows back into cash during the current quarter.And of course, the outlay to the inventory suppliers for Tingo Foods, which we outlaid at the end of Q2, also has generated a positive cash flow inflow in the third quarter. And as I've said on a number of occasions today, the investment we made into the new mobile phone handsets, it started generating revenues and profits from September. And let's not forget the inflow from those mobile phones is something that we expect to see over the next three years on a monthly basis.Thank you, Team. The next question asks, I know this question has been asked before, but I'm still confused as to why the NWASSA app is on a USSD platform, and it's not a standard app as you would see in the App Store or Google Play?Darren MercerOkay, let me try and square this circle once and for all. So look, first thing we need to understand that Nigeria's telecoms and internet infrastructure, it's just not as well developed as countries like the United States, or the United Kingdom, or developed Europe. And as such, 4G, 5G, even Wi-Fi, sometimes even 3G are only available in the largest cities, and certainly not in most of Nigeria's rural areas.In fact, where many of our farmers are located, they don't have access to data coverage. And as such, a web-based app that we would typically expect to see on our handsets in the US or the UK or Europe, for example, it just simply won't work in those areas. As such the USSD platform, which is similar to the old WAP services that some of you may well remember, was used commonly on mobile phones when the displays were in monochrome, which is primarily text-based. But this is the only type of platform that's accessible to many of Nigeria's farmers.It is not just Tingo that offers USSD platform in Nigeria. In fact, nearly every bank, insurance company, telco, public service provider, they all operate a USSD platform because of those very issues. All of that being said, I mean, Nigeria is developing at pace. A network and data coverage will continue to get better over time, which is the reason why we are now developing NWASSA web-based app, which once launched will be operated in parallel with our USSD version.Look, I think it's when we launch the full version of the TingoPays app, which is web based, that you'll see a platform that resembles what you are used to seeing in the United States and Europe. But remember the difference here, is that's aimed at the middle classes in Nigeria's cities and towns, such as Lagos and Abuja. And it isn't aimed at the farming communities, in the rural parts of the country.Thank you, team. Our next question asks, is it clear that the new food processing plant being built for Tingo Foods will have a material contribution to group revenues and profitability. However, given the plant is not scheduled to come online for around another 12 months, can you comment on the plans for Tingo Foods in the meantime?Darren MercerYeah look, it is true that we expect -- that whether we have considerable expectations around the new food processing plant. Its's going to give us a state-of-the-art facility that can process a whole wide range of food types and produce a multitude of food and beverage products. And it's something we've said publicly. We expect it to contribute a multi-billion dollars of revenue on an annual basis each year.But notwithstanding the fact we're waiting for this plant to come online, I'm delighted to tell you that Tingo Foods continues to expand. In fact, during the second quarter, we added two major product groups to our range; one was based on around wheat, and the other was based around the maze. And at the time, and whilst I'm speaking today, it's fair to say that those quantities are fairly small.But what this has enabled us to do is to plan around forthcoming harvest, to enable us to build our supply chain and then thereby get far greater quantities of crops from the farmers to process into food producers, and so that where we know there is considerable demand for.But that progress wasn't just on the supply side. During the quarter we also onboarded a major new wholesale customer. When given how late it was in the quarter that we won the customer and the time I gave them to book their orders, the amounts we delivered, again, were relatively small. But given the size of this particular customer in the market in which it operates, we're very confident that this customer will become a very large account for Tingo Foods by the end of this year.But what's really pleasing, I think, about these developments in particular, is that we managed to achieve them in spite of a period of what I called earlier in the presentation, an economic stagnation, where the people of Nigeria had reduced their discretionary spend and wholesalers to restaurants and hotels and other customers had reduced their inventory levels whilst we were monitoring what was going on within the political situation in Nigeria.You've heard me reference before about the presidential election that took place in February of this year. Following this, there was some speculation that the election results were going to be challenged by opposition leaders, and that is what created this period of instability and stagnation.But with the new president was inaugurated at the end of May and with him now in place, we're witnessing a recovery in consumer confidence and business confidence, which to be fair, has been underpinned and held by the new government's focus on creating jobs and modernizing and stabilizing the economy. And the benefit of course of that we mentioned earlier was this liberalizing supporting of its currency. But all of these points really indicate that the economic recovery in Nigeria is upon us, which of course bodes well for the rest of our business.And we're also making progress with further developments in the current quarter, including in terms of continuing to expand our product range. In particular into areas where produce that requires more heavily processed products such as sources. And we expect these developments also to generate a significant contribution in Q4 and beyond.Thank you, team. And our final question asks, today's news about the commencement of a quarterly dividend is very welcome indeed. I am sure it will go a long way to redress the clearly undervalued share price. However, does the board not consider that those funds will be better spent on a share buyback?Darren MercerYeah, whilst you understand the sentiment I think behind the question, I think it's really important to put into perspective the considerations we have as a Board and ensuring that we do our best to deliver and then protect shareholder value. Because I mentioned earlier, the company spent almost $1 billion on investments into CapEx and inventory during the quarter. Of course, not to mention the $170 million that we paid the tax then.And that investment was made, but the primary purpose of growing the three key divisions of the group. Tingo Mobile that we spent $460 million in new handsets on, but we've said we expect to start receiving significant revenues from at the end of Q3. Tingo DMCC, where we completed our first export transactions of almost $350 million during the quarter. And Tingo Foods where we've secured huge quantities OF produce that we're going to see the benefits from, again, in Q3.You've heard me say earlier that we expect to start paying much higher dividends from Q3 onwards, without the [$1 billion] of expenditure we had and we're just spending in Q2, the dividend almost certainly would've been somewhat higher this quarter.Look, our priority -- our first priority as a board is maximizing shareholder return. And all shareholders we believe will reap the benefits of that $1 billion we've just spent, or just invested. And as a result of that we expect our cash balances to be significantly higher at the end of Q3 than they were in Q2. And that's what gives this Board the confidence that we will be in a position to increase our dividends from Q3 onwards.Now look, all of that said, it's not lost on management or the board that our share price at these levels. It's significantly below where we think it should be. Bear in mind that we've generated around $1.8 billion of revenue and $600 million of EBITDA during the first half of this year.This dividend payment today, as I've said on several occasions, is the start of an ongoing regular course of the dividend program. We believe it's the message that will help us expand and grow the number of institutional shareholders on our shareholder list. Regular quarterly dividends that have a high dividend cover and offer very attractive yields, we believe are the ingredients that help us attract a new investor audience, including those institutional income funds and pension funds alike. And as such, we hope that gets reflected into the share price.However, should our share price continue to languish below a fair value, as we approach the end of Q3, the Board if it so chooses, may well consider a meaningful share buyback. Alongside a significant increase in dividend payments because what is clear is that we will, we believe, will have sufficient cash reserve to accommodate both.Thank you, team. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mercer for his closing remarks.Darren MercerThank you, operator.

(NYSE:EL), a giant in the beauty industry, has been using blockchain to track various components in its supply chain since 2020. The company uses blockchain to track ingredients vulnerable to environmental or labor inconsistencies. Aveda, a brand by the Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), uses blockchain to keep track of their Madagascan vanilla supply. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) has partnered with Wholechain to ensure visibility in the entire supply chain while also enabling stakeholders to check the ingredients' quality. Mediledger Network, administered by Chronicled, uses blockchain in healthcare to curb counterfeit medicine. Mediledger Network works with many pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Genentech. It uses blockchain to validate the authenticity of a drug through the supply chain. It also allows healthcare organizations to process large amounts of product-related data.Story continuesCompanies are also using blockchains to enhance their customer experience. In December 2021, Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) acquired RTKFT. The virtual clothing startup enabled Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to launch Cryptokicks, allowing collectors to own digital along with physical versions of their shoes. The digital versions can be worn in Nikeland in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) metaverse. Cryptokicks ""forges"" NFTs to its shoes by fitting each pair with a tiny chip linked to a blockchain. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has also started using decentralized digital identities rooted in blockchain to transform its traditional loyalty program system. Swoosh, a platform by Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), allows users to co-create virtual products. This gamified loyalty program uses blockchain to maintain a transparent and secure record of customer activities. While blockchain has utility outside of cryptocurrencies, its most prominent use case is digital currencies. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $5.15 billion in 2023 and has been projected to grow to $11.71 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12.5%. Despite having a turbulent year in 2022, cryptocurrency has managed to stay relevant in the current financial world. Some of the most prominent companies working on blockchain and cryptocurrency include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). On August 7, Reuters reported that Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) became one of the first major fintech companies to embrace digital currency by launching a US dollar-based stablecoin. This launch has helped restore some of the confidence lost in cryptocurrency because of several high-profile collapses and strict regulations being imposed.However, cryptocurrency is not out of turmoil yet. On August 25, Reuters reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Binance, a crypto exchange platform, will end their four crypto card programs by mid-September in four countries including Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia, and Brazil. Neither Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) nor Binance has publicly disclosed the reason for the termination of the programs. However, it could have been done in the wake of US lawsuits against Binance filed in June. Blockchain and the Financial Services SectorAccording to the report by Grand View Research, in 2022, the financial services sector had the biggest share of the global blockchain revenue, 37%. Blockchains have the potential to transform how the future of traditional financial institutions would look. Transactions on Wall Street are marked by the involvement of a third party like brokers and market makers which slows things down. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. This shift could transform the entire process, making it more streamlined and efficient. The financial services sector is experiencing an insidious but profound change, slowly transitioning into a future intertwined with blockchain. In November 2022, according to an article by Blockworks, Onyxx by JPMorgan, a bank-led blockchain platform, ran its first decentralized finance transaction on a public blockchain, using Ethereum to exchange Japanese yen for Singaporean dollars. The successful tokenization experiment was a monumental step for DeFi. Umer Farooq, the CEO of Onyx JPMorgan, commented on the potential of blockchain in Wall Street saying:""We have always believed that this technology has the ability to really revolutionize and rewrite financial market infrastructure whether that infrastructure is to move money, securities, or any other kind of assets. So despite all the ups and downs of prices and crypto and all that, I think we've been pretty consistent that the technology itself has a lot of power to rethink financial infrastructure.""On June 5, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan has introduced a blockchain-based platform to settle interbank dollar transactions among six banks in India. This platform would support New Delhi's attempt to push GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) forward. The blockchain-based platform is expected to ease the time required for settlements greatly and would be available around the clock. Blockchains are innately transparent and cut down the need for intermediaries. Tokenization has been gaining popularity worldwide; however, it is important to note that it is not a cure-all. The CNBC article highlighted that implementing tokenization and blockchain would solve only a segment of problems that financial institutions face today, and the transformation could be slow. However, blockchain technology is poised to be a significant part of the financial sector in the future. Many formal education institutions have already gauged the incoming digital revolution and are equipping their students with the knowledge to participate fully in this transformation.

V and Mastercard Incorporated MA, intend to hike credit card fees paid by merchants when they accept cards from customers, per the Wall Street Journal. The fee hikes are expected to materialize in October and April, per the report.Most of the increases are related to online purchases. CMSPI, a consulting firm, told the Wall Street Journal that the new fee structure will likely cost merchants an extra $502 million per annum. While more than half of that amount will likely come from network charges, interchange fees — commonly known as swipe fees — will provide the rest, per the merchant consulting firm.With the rapid expansion of e-commerce and digital transactions, these fee hikes are bound to rake in more revenues for Visa and Mastercard. A significant portion of these fees will likely be passed on to consumers through price hikes. While the network charges go to the card companies, the swipe fees are received by the banks, according to the Journal.Last year alone, U.S. merchants paid about $93 billion to Visa and Mastercard in credit-card fees, per Nilson Report. The figure surged from $33 billion in 2012.But there is resistance.The Credit Card Competition Act, a bipartisan bill, was reintroduced in both the House and the Senate in June with additional co-sponsors. The proposed measure is expected to increase competition through the usage of alternative credit card processing networks. This will likely increase the decision-making power of the merchants.Also, V and MA were facing an antitrust lawsuit filed with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Block, Inc. SQ in July. The operator of payments platform Square, Block, claimed that the payment technology giants conspired to inflate interchange fees and reduce competition.Nevertheless, Visa and Mastercard argue that the fees are utilized to offset the cost of fraud prevention and increase security and innovation. Also, a chunk of the money goes to credit-card rewards programs. The companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.While the fee hikes can increase revenues for these payment companies, it can affect small businesses that are dealing with inflationary woes and a high interest rate environment. The situation can push toward more payments with cash and debit. With small businesses offering incentives to consumers for paying in cash to avoid paying the fees, the digital payments growth rate will likely be impacted.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Arturo Holmes/Getty Images) (Arturo Holmes via Getty Images)The decision could bolster the chances for other asset managers to win approval for their bitcoin products. The world’s largest money manager, BlackRock (BLK), filed paperwork with the SEC in June to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Coinbase (COIN) would be the custodian for those bitcoin holdings.'We have to be a little bit patient'But it is not yet clear that spot bitcoin offerings are a sure thing. The ruling from the federal appeals court only requires the SEC to review Grayscale's application, not to approve it. And the SEC has until mid-October to request a re-hearing of the case. It has said it is reviewing the decision.""We have to be a little bit patient,"" Grayscale's Sonnenshein said.The uncertainty may help explain why a rally in cryptocurrencies companies and digital assets fizzled on Wednesday after rocketing higher Tuesday in the hours after the Grayscale ruling was disclosed.Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched $28,000 by late Tuesday afternoon but had dropped near $27,000 on Wednesday. It is still up 64% from the start of the year.Story continuesThe stock of Coinbase fell 1.2% Wednesday while bitcoin mining firms Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) were down 3% and 2.4%, respectively. All three surged by double-digit percentages on Tuesday, and are up considerably year to date.The Grayscale bitcoin trust, the largest trust holder of bitcoin in the world, was down more than 4% Wednesday and traded at an 18% discount, according to YCharts.If the trust is allowed to convert into an ETF, the discount would be immediately eliminated.The wider warThe SEC is fighting battles with the cryptocurrency industry on a number of other fronts. Since the beginning of 2023, the SEC has charged 19 different crypto actors with violating securities laws, including exchanges like Coinbase and Binance that allow investors to trade digital currencies. The Grayscale decision does not impact those cases.The SEC’s core assertion in many of these securities law cases is that cryptocurrencies are securities, and therefore should be registered with the agency.But the courts thus far have not been clear on how digital currencies should be treated, raising uncertainty around how the government's crackdown could play out.Analisa Torres, a US judge in the Southern District of New York, said on July 13 that a digital token issued by Ripple Labs was a security only when it was sold to institutional investors, and not when it was purchased by the general public.Then July 31, US judge Jed Rakoff disagreed with that specific view in his case, in which the SEC has alleged stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs sold unregistered securities.He determined that how a crypto token is sold — whether through an exchange or directly to institutional investors — does not determine whether any reasonable investor would expect the promise of profits. Rakoff ruled the SEC's case against Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon could proceed.'The staying power of the asset class'Sonnenshein said he is encouraged that the recent legal decisions combined with some movement in Washington around legislating the crypto world will provide momentum for the industry.Last month, the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee passed legislation out of committee that aims to create clarity around gaps between the rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC.The bill provides the CFTC with jurisdiction over digital commodities and clarifies the SEC's jurisdiction over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract. It also tries to direct what firms need to do to register with the SEC and requires the SEC to write new rules that are customized to govern crypto.""It is encouraging to actually see crypto becoming a nonpartisan issue,"" Sonnenshein said.Next year, he added, the industry could get another boost when when the bitcoin blockchain gets a supply cut that could raise the price of that cryptocurrency relative to other digital assets.There are ""some catalysts that could be really, really unique to continuing to underscore the staying power of the asset class,” he said. It could mean ""an environment around crypto that we haven’t seen before.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Yahoo Finance Reporter David Hollerith explains how the crypto industry is looking at the ruling, saying ""it might be seen as just one minor win”. As for what it means for the SEC, Hollerith says “at this point, the SEC kind of has to go back to the drawing board.""Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: A spot Bitcoin ETF is now a step closer to reality, an appeals court paving the way for Grayscale to launch its ETF, which was initially denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission. David Hollerith is here with the details. David, we've seen crypto rallying on the back of this. What does it all mean?DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Akiko, it is a bit of a hype rally. That being said, it can be read two ways. One is that this is a little bit of a better chance than had previously been had in terms of seeing approval of a US spot Bitcoin ETF. But also two, it might be seen as just one minor win.Which has been this field of court cases we've seen to decide whether or not the crypto industry can be regulated in the US and in a viable way that is matching what we're seeing in other jurisdictions, such as Europe. But to get into the court case a little bit, Grayscale's is unique in that they have a closed-ended fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. So it's like an ETF except it can't automatically create or redeem shares.So as a result, it trades at a discount and Grayscale has-- like other asset managers that have wanted to issue a ETF, Grayscale has asked to have their Bitcoin Trust converted into an ETF. Now notably, this is also the world's largest Bitcoin Trust. And in the trust is about 3.4% of all bitcoins that are currently circulating. Now that being said, the SEC has not approved anything from Grayscale as of yet.And the reasoning has been that the Bitcoin spot market is easily manipulated. And that goes against-- at least as industry advocates had said, that goes against the bitcoin futures ETFs that the SEC approved a little less than two years ago. Now the point of this court case was to decide whether or not the futures bitcoin contracts or the futures bitcoin market was like the spot bitcoin market.Story continuesAnd today it was ruled by three US circuit judges that in fact, they are pretty much the same thing. And so the SEC's decision making according to the court judges was arbitrary and capricious. Which means that at this point, the SEC has to go back to the drawing board. Both Grayscale and the SEC today have said that they're reviewing the verdict. And it's not really clear what next steps will be in either case.The SEC may be able to appeal the decision. In this case, it could be 17 other judges reviewing it or they could take the case up to the Supreme Court.AKIKO FUJITA: And David, it sounds like this is far from over. But at least for today, we're seeing some excitement in bitcoin with that up just around 7.5%.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Snap-On in FocusHeadquartered in Kenosha, Snap-On (SNA) is a Consumer Discretionary stock that has seen a price change of 17.68% so far this year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.62 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.41% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.89% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.52%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $18.45 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 9.69%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SNA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Valuable Brands In The World In 2023. In 2023, the global business landscape continues to evolve, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and dynamic market forces. The world's most valuable brands like Amazon, Apple, and Walmart among others are at the forefront of this ever-changing landscape, whose influence extends far beyond their products and services. These brands represent the pinnacle of success, embodying innovation, trust, and a deep understanding of their customers. As we delve into the year's rankings, we discover not only the names that have retained their coveted positions but also those newcomers that have surged ahead, reshaping industries and setting new standards for excellence. Regional and Industry Trends in Brand Valuation In recent years, exciting changes have emerged in brand valuation. One outstanding trend is the growing importance of brand value in emerging markets, particularly in Asia. As these economies expand and become more consumer-focused, brands that build strong customer relationships are well-positioned for success. Regarding specific industries, technology, and retail dominate the brand valuation landscape. However, there's also a noticeable shift towards sustainability and social responsibility, with brands prioritizing these values and seeing increased recognition and value. This shift is especially evident in the fashion industry, where consumers are becoming more conscious of their purchases' environmental and ethical impact. In terms of financial statistics, recent data shows that the total value of the world's top 100 brands reached $7 trillion in 2021, marking a 44% increase from the previous year. The world's top 10 most valuable brands are predominantly technology companies, with Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft claiming the top three spots. Nevertheless, several fashion and consumer goods brands, such as Nike and Louis Vuitton, have also secured marks on the list, underscoring the significance of brand value across various industries. Story continuesTechnology Dominance: Tech Companies Among the Top Brands It's hard to deny technology's significant impact on our daily lives. We rely heavily on devices like smartphones and laptops to stay connected, informed, and entertained. It's no wonder, then, that tech companies are among the top brands in the world. For instance, Apple's innovative products and sleek designs consistently rank it as one of the most valuable brands globally.  According to Forbes, Apple's brand is worth $241.2 billion. Similarly, Google's search engine and online tools have become synonymous with the internet. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is worth over $1 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies globally. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become household names, with billions of active users worldwide.  Facebook's revenue for 2022 was $116.6 billion, while Instagram's revenue is expected to reach $50 billion by 2023. But it's not just the big players dominating the tech industry. Startups and smaller companies are also making waves, disrupting traditional industries and improving our lives in new ways. Fintech companies like Robinhood and Chime are changing how we invest and manage our money, while healthcare startups like Babylon Health and Heal use technology to improve access to healthcare services. Future Outlook for Brand Valuation in 2023 In 2023, the continued rise of social media is expected to shape brand valuation. This trend will lead to a greater need to measure the impact of social media on brand value as more and more companies invest in their online presence. Advancements in data analytics and artificial intelligence will make it easier to collect and analyze data on consumer behaviour and brand sentiment, resulting in more accurate and reliable brand valuation.  In addition, the growing importance of sustainability and corporate social responsibility will likely impact brand valuation. As consumers become more conscious of the impact of their purchases on the environment and society, companies that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices will see an increase in brand value. This shift in consumer behavior will require companies to focus on financial performance and their societal impact, which will be reflected in their brand valuation. 25 Most Valuable Brands In The World 2023Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Our Methodology For our methodology, we have ranked the most valuable brands in the world in 2023 based on their brand values as of 2023.

So we are very intentional about upgrading technology and infrastructure in places like MetLife Stadium to accommodate our customers’ needs.”MetLife Stadium is having its busiest summer ever with over 1.2 million guests and a record 18 concerts. The excitement continues as the Stadium heads into the NFL season with back-to-back national night games – Giants-Cowboys on Sunday Night Football, Sept. 10 and Jets-Bills on Monday Night Football, Sept. 11.“Creating a memorable, positive experience for everyone who comes to MetLife Stadium is a critical part of our mission,” said Ron VanDeVeen, President and CEO of MetLife Stadium. “Verizon was a founding Cornerstone partner when the stadium opened in 2010 and we are excited to extend and expand on that partnership with this renewal. The Verizon upgrades will enhance the overall fan experience and our stadium operations, and are integral to attracting future major events such as FIFA World Cup 26™.”The unprecedented investment and network improvements at MetLife Stadium will be anchored by Verizon’s new Distributed Antenna System (DAS), a wireless network of antennas throughout the stadium allowing for better performance and greater capacity to accommodate fans’ needs.Story continuesThe new DAS system will provide 4G LTE service and 5G Ultra Wideband service using Verizon’s C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage in addition to the 5G service it already offers in the stadium using its premium millimeter wave spectrum. It will cover the field, bowl, concourse (including the four gate entrances), all clubs/suites, and the ticketing areas. As part of the new design, engineers are also adding a performance enhancement technology that divides crowds into sectors like pieces of a pie. Each sector can be adjusted individually to handle wireless traffic. This technology gives Verizon engineers more leeway to adjust performance based on where customers move and how they use data inside the stadium.With these network enhancements, customers will be able to do many more things on their mobile phones during games and events. From sharing their experience in the stadium to using their phones for getting refreshments, navigating the stadium, participating in fan experiences like sports betting, fantasy leagues and looking up players’ stats, gaining entrance to the stadium and more, customers need a robust and reliable experience. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the stadium will require upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to connect the stadium to the rest of the network. Verizon is also increasing the capacity on the fiber connections in and out of MetLife so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.NFL Sunday Ticket on VerizonVerizon’s long standing partnership with the NFL is only getting stronger, from delivering the best in-stadium fan experiences with our 5G Network to transforming on-the-field coach-to-coach communications. Now, Verizon is the only wireless carrier giving customers a limited time, exclusive “on us” promotion with an eligible phone purchase and Unlimited Plus plan, for every out-of-market Sunday afternoon game on YouTube and YouTube TV this season – that’s up to $449 in savings. New Verizon mobile and home internet customers can qualify for NFL Sunday Ticket1 from YouTube and YouTube TV – the League’s subscription package that includes out-of-market Sunday afternoon regular-season NFL games (based on viewer’s location) broadcast on FOX and CBS – on us.About VerizonVerizon Communications Inc.

CAH recently launched its next-generation NTrainer System 2.0. The medical device is expected to help in reducing the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) length of stay for premature and newborn infants.The NTrainer System 2.0 is currently the only FDA Class II biofeedback device designed to help newborns and infants born prematurely develop their non-nutritive sucking skills needed for independent oral feeding.The latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen Cardinal Health’s Medical business.Significance of the LaunchThe NTrainer System is expected to improve vital pre-feeding skills in newborns and preterm infants, known as non-nutritive suck (NNS). NNS is crucial for the safe transition from feeding tubes to breast or bottle. This is a developmental milestone for preterm infants and has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics as the criterion for discharge from the NICU. Cardinal Health's NTrainer has been clinically proven to improve feeding outcomes while also reducing the length of NICU stay by utilizing its patented technology for improving NNS proficiency.Also, the NTrainer System provides clinicians with the required objective data via real-time assessment technology to track the progress of an infant in developing pre-feeding skills. This is also likely to assure parent about their infants' progress and potential to thrive after discharge.Per management, the NTrainer System is expected to aid some of the most vulnerable patients at the beginning of life via the biofeedback device to improve NNS patterns in newborns and infants born prematurely.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Spherical Insights, the global biofeedback instrument market was valued at $165.4 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $263.2 million by 2032 at a CAGR of approximately 4.8%. Factors like the increased prevalence of stress-related mental diseases and the growing need for improving vital pre-feeding skills in newborns and preterm infants are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest launch is likely to provide a significant boost to Cardinal Health's business.Recent Developments in Medical SegmentThis month, Cardinal Health reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it recorded a solid uptick in its overall top line. The company also recorded significant improvement in the Medical segment, driven by the execution of its Medical Improvement Plan.In June, Cardinal Health announced its plans to build a new distribution center in the Greenville, SC, area to support its at-Home Solutions business.In May, Cardinal Health Canada announced plans to open a new distribution center in the Greater Toronto Area. This was expected to expand its distribution footprint to nine strategic locations to better meet the medical and surgical product demands of the Canadian healthcare system.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 23.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 13.7% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 13.8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Cardinal Health carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

Our projection for fiscal second-quarter revenues was $465 million.Professional services and other revenues were up 13.3% year over year to $119.6 million, primarily resulting from continued strength in Research and Development (R&amp;D) Solutions services and Veeva Business Consulting.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $616.6 million.Subscription revenues are estimated to be approximately $493 million in the fiscal third quarter.Adjusted EPS is projected to be between $1.26 and $1.27.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37 billion.Subscription revenues are now expected to be $1.895, reflecting an uptick from the earlier projection of $1.890 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $4.57.Our TakeVeeva Systems exited the second quarter of fiscal 2024 with better-than-expected results. The uptick in the overall top and bottom lines and robust performances by both segments during the quarter were impressive. The company continues to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions with new small- to mid-sized customer additions and strong win rates in core Veeva CRM looked promising.Veeva Systems registered great traction in newer areas, including Veeva Vault Safety, Vault LIMS and Veeva Compass, which augurs well. The continued momentum in CTMS and eTMF in clinical operations raises our optimism.On the flip side, the rising operating costs putting pressure on the margins during the quarter was concerning. The continued project scrutiny across the board and the challenging funding environment are putting pressure on smaller companies while some smaller companies have been acquired, sold assets or ceased operations. These dynamics are impacting some of Veeva Systems’ smaller biotech customers using its R&amp;D products. This raises our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksVeeva Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are DaVita Inc.

As we wade deeper into the 21st century, green hydrogen stocks are not only sparking the interest of environmental enthusiasts but also establishing themselves as astute picks for visionary investors.The U.S. government’s profound commitment to climate change has led it to embrace green hydrogen’s untapped aptitude. This commitment became evident following the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. This transformative legislation directed an astounding $370 billion into the clean energy sector. More specifically, $9.5 billion was allocated solely for green hydrogen projects. Additionally, Goldman Sachs’s prediction of the hydrogen market blooming into a whopping $1 trillion a year industry incites confidence in investors.Moreover, with the U.S. Department of Energy recently announcing an investment of $1 billion in hydrogen production projects, it’s apparent that the future is not just bright but green. As the energy landscape undergoes this vibrant transition, investors are determined to make the most of it. Here are the three most promising green hydrogen technologies poised to influence this electrifying future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) boasts a dazzling 80% market share in the fuel cell market in the U.S., showcasing its powerhouse status. It has pulled off a remarkable feat, effectively pivoting towards the burgeoning hydrogen fuel cell market. Its recent 10-megawatt solid oxide fuel cell installation at Unimicron Technology Corporation in Taiwan speaks volumes about its efforts in the space. Moreover, the contract, delivered in just five months, underscores its agility in offering nimble power solutions.Financially, there’s a mixed bag with promising glimmers. Bloom astounded with almost a 24% year-over-year second-quarter revenue surge, raking in a staggering $301 million. However, as it navigates through financial hurdles — a $54.5 million operating loss — the company remains undeterred in its growth-first approach.

Despite the turbulence of the stock market this year, the firm has effectively marched to its own beat. Evidence of this includes the robust 72% surge in second-quarter revenue, reaching a commendable $260.18 million, beating the market consensus by a promising 5%.Despite a quarterly loss of 40 cents per share, Plug’s cryogenics and liquefaction sectors displayed impressive growth, growing by 283% from the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, after clinching a deal in Australia, Plug secured the title of the largest announced project in the European oil and gas sector with its 100 MW green hydrogen electrolyzers. With such momentum and a blooming trajectory, Plug Power seems poised for substantial growth. Moreover, TipRanks analysts forecast a bullish $19.98 per share for this green hydrogen stock, pointing to a stunning 126% upside.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comDiving into the green hydrogen realm, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) emerges as a tantalizing spectacle for potential investors.

But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs EV and Battery Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Best Mining Penny Stocks to Buy Now20 Biggest ETFs by Volume10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts Disclosure: None.

Household consumption on an annualized basis tanked 15% in the second quarter.The barrage of bad economic reads sent the Hang Seng Index to an 8.5% decline in August, the worst performance since a 9.4% plunge in February.While the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has moved to cut interest rates to stabilize the economy, investors remain wary of putting money to work.""Investors are waiting for signs that Beijing, facing mounting downside pressures on growth, will adopt significantly more forceful and effective stimulus policies,"" 22V Research founder Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a client note. ""The latest signals are not very encouraging, suggesting continuation of a conservative approach despite the risks that it is insufficient to address China’s current challenges.""""There is little to suggest that Xi is abandoning his view that China must remain patient in the current recovery, avoid adopting measures that would worsen long-term debt risks, and focus on cultivating new growth drivers (such as clean tech) rather than propping up old growth drivers such as property,"" DeBusschere added.The sluggishness in China could present earnings risk to US multinationals headed into year-end.Here's what several top CEOs have told Yahoo Finance this month on the state of their businesses in China.People use an umbrella as they walk past a Lego store on a rainy day in Beijing on July 13, 2023.

So really at a level lower than we've seen in many years as a result of the very stringent COVID lockdown policy and the sluggish economy that we see in China. That market for us continues to be quite depressed. We're projecting some slow recovery, but really not seeing any dramatic signs of improvement in the market in China.""Story continuesLego Group CEO Niels B. ChristiansenFast fact: By the end of 2023, Lego will have 50% of its retail store base in China.""I'd say we haven't seen the acceleration out of the pandemic as fast as we had anticipated [in China]. So China came out of the pandemic later. And we had assumed that they would return to traffic in stores and consumer spending the way we've seen it in other countries. And I think we've been a bit disappointed that has happened quite a bit slower. So we're not exactly where we thought we would be at this point in China. I don't think it changes the fact that it is a big market with a lot of kids and an opportunity for our brands. We're keeping our investments going. We're building stores in China. But we have seen that [recovery] happen a bit slower.""Cisco CEO Chuck RobbinsFast fact: In its annual report, Cisco noted this as a key risk to its business in China: ""As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.""""We are very lightly exposed to China. It's less than 2% of our business. So it's not a significant part. But clearly, it seems to not be coming back online as fast as everyone expected them to. And I think that they'll continue to work the policy, they lowered their interest rates, which was interesting.

It was a big shock for tennis fans who couldn’t watch the latest rounds of the US Open.It’s not an overstatement to say the future of the pay-TV business hangs in the balance. Cable and satellite providers have lost 25 million subscribers over the past five years, according to Charter. The cable company, second only to Comcast Corp., wants out of standard industry contracts that require customers to pay for sports and other channels even if they don’t watch them.Instead, Charter has proposed a different set up, where consumers are given more options to choose the channels they pay for. The company has proposed packaging Disney streaming services, such as Disney+ and ESPN+, with its other products, something it said the company rejected.“Ultimately Disney gave us a choice, either carry on with the bad path for consumers or to look for completely new video models for our customers,” Charter Chief Executive Officer Chris Winfrey said on a call with investors Friday.Disney said in a statement Thursday night that it’s committed to reaching a “mutually agreed upon resolution” with Charter. That’s when it announced it was removing channels like ABC and ESPN from Charter systems. Disney urged Charter to work to minimize disruption to customers.Story continuesIn a separate statement Friday, Disney said Charter is demanding the company’s streaming services for free.This dispute could be a tipping point for the industry, New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin wrote in a research note Friday. The “crux of the dispute” appears to be ESPN, which Disney has hinted it will ultimately offer direct to consumers online, Chaplin wrote.Charter “risks the loss of avid sports fans, with football fans being the most avid of all,” he said.The dispute triggered a broad decline in media stocks. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Paramount Global, two companies closely tied to the cable TV model, tumbled 12% and nearly 10% respectively. Disney fell 2.4%, while Charter was down 3.6%.Charter pays about $2.2 billion in annual programming costs to Disney, not including the impact of advertising revenue, while only about a quarter of its subscribers regularly engage with Disney content, it said in a presentation on its website Friday. The company suggested one option it has considered is exiting the video business entirely.Media companies such as Disney have fought with pay-TV providers for years over the value of channels like ESPN and Freeform, often leading to contract disputes and temporary blackouts. The rising cost of TV packages and the number of channels included in those packages has prompted tens of millions of people to stop paying for live TV.“The multichannel video product is too expensive and packages don’t meet consumer needs,” Charter said in its presentation. “Disney – so far – has insisted on a traditional long-term deal with higher rates and limited packaging flexibility.”The potential short-term impacts include an immediate reduction in programming cost and some one-time costs, such as customer credits, Charter said.Disney could also see a bump in ESPN+ subscribers, although that service doesn’t offer the same programming as the ESPN cable channels.(Updates with closing stock prices in tenth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) HereIs Carlos Alcaraz the Next Billion-Dollar Tennis Player?How a Tiny Mexican Border City Built a Budget Dental EmpireThe Hostile Takeover of Blue Cities by Red StatesCan You Name These Cities?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$345.2mUS$443.8mUS$412.0mUS$422.0mUS$431.2mUS$440.6mUS$450.2mUS$459.9mUS$469.9mUS$480.0mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.19%Est @ 2.18%Est @ 2.17%Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.16%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$315US$369US$312US$291US$271US$252US$235US$219US$204US$190(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.7bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$480m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.2%) = US$6.5bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.5b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$2.6bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$5.2b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$40.4, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Helmerich &amp; Payne as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.516. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Helmerich &amp; PayneStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

But the market will respond, as you want it to, and that’s all that matters.Crude prices hit 7-month highs on Friday, jumping as much as 7% on the week, responding to growing market conviction that Saudi Arabia will extend in October its voluntary monthly production cut of one million barrels per day introduced in July.Adding to that was data showing better-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in August despite a rise in unemployment, with the Labor Department reporting 187,000 new non-farm payrolls versus a forecast 170,000 and a jobless rate of 3.8% from July’s 3.5%. The jobs numbers, at the least, “signal interest rates may not rise any further”, something all risk assets seemed to take positively, said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.On the oil production front, the Saudis hinted at the October cut a month ago, saying they could even be deeper than before if warranted — a threat ostensibly aimed at short-sellers who might try to take prices down. While they have yet to make it official, the Russians, who happen to be the Saudis’ main ally in the OPEC+ group of 23-oil producing countries, did both their sides a favor this week by saying more “actions” were coming in the way of the oil market.The Russian disclosure came after data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles tumbling a third week in a row as refiners ramped up fuel processing to meet demand ahead of Monday’s Labor Day holiday — which marks the last hurrah for summer travel each year.With two days of back-to-back gains of 2% or more, New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled Friday’s trade at $85.55 per barrel. For the day itself, it gained $1.92, or 2.3%, after Thursday’s 2.5 climb%. Week-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark finished up 7.2%. That was after a combined 4% drop over two prior weeks as the economy in top importer China sputtered. Prior to that, WTI gained 20% over seven weeks.Story continuesLondon-traded Brent settled at $88.55 per barrel, up $1.72, or 2%. For the week, Brent rose 4.8%. That was after a combined 2.3% drop over two weeks. Prior to that, the global crude benchmark rose for seven weeks in a row, gaining a total of 18%.Oil rally resumes in earnest but seasonal lows in demand also comingWith the oil rally having resumed earnestly, the upside in crude prices could last in the interim with OPEC likely to make more rumblings to try and get Brent to the Saudis’ cherished target of $90 or more.But with U.S. road travel seen easing hereafter and the oil market typically entering a seasonal low in demand during the fall season starting Sept. 23, the market could start feeling heavy without a commensurate downside adjustment.“Demand is always a bigger proponent than supply and eventually it’ll show if it’s weak,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “China is still not buying enough and Iran is exporting more and more oil to to challenge the hyped up tight supply picture that’s hijacked the market narrative now.”Reuters, using secondary sources on oil production, estimated that output within the narrower OPEC, or the 13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries led by Saudi Arabia, had climbed by 220,000 barrels per day — thanks to a jump in Iranian output.Iran is a founding member of the six-decade old OPEC that is essentially treated as an outcast within the cartel due to Trump-era sanctions on its oil exports. Once a major burden to its economy, the sanctions mean little these days to Tehran, thanks to little enforcement by the Biden administration. Iran’s crude production and exports have both been growing steadily the past two years to the consternation of the Saudis and Russians, who jointly steer OPEC+, the broader alliance of oil producers consisting of 23 countries.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)Related ArticlesOil jumps 7% on week as rally restarts on OPEC threat of more cutsGold up 1.4% on week as mixed U.S. jobs for Aug checks hawkish FedOil rises to highest in over seven months on supply worries]"

Shares have lost about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Prudential due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Prudential Financial Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Down Y/YPrudential Financial, Inc. reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted operating income of $2.94 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. However, the bottom line rose 25.6% year over year.Total revenues of $12,644 million decreased 2.4% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.3%. The decline in revenues was due to lower asset management fees, commissions and other income. Prudential Financial's second-quarter results were affected by declining income from the asset management business. Improving premiums, policy charges, fee income and net investment income partially offset the negatives.Operational UpdateTotal benefits and expenses amounted to $11,252 million, which declined 4.7% year over year in the second quarter. This decrease was due to lower insurance and annuity benefits and a change in estimates of liability for future policy benefits. However, the figure surpassed our estimate by 3.6%.Quarterly Segment UpdatePrudential Global Investment Management’s (PGIM) adjusted operating income of $179 million declined 13.1% year over year. The metric missed our estimate by 10.1%. The decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees due to net outflows and higher rates in the quarter. The negatives were partially offset by higher other-related revenues.PGIM assets under management of $1.3 trillion in the reported quarter were up 1% year over year due to appreciation in equity markets, partially offset by higher interest rates and net outflows.The U.S. Businesses delivered an adjusted operating income of $956 million, which increased 66.8% year over year. The metric beat our estimate by 11.2%. The upside was due to higher net investment spread results and lower net fee income. This segment also benefited from more favorable underwriting results.International Businesses adjusted operating income increased 13.3% year over year to $784 million in the second quarter. The metric beat our estimate by 10.6%. This increase primarily reflects improving emerging market earnings and business growth.Corporate and Other incurred an adjusted operating loss of $527 million, wider than $321 million reported a year ago. The metric was higher than our estimate of a loss of $363.1 million. This higher loss was due to higher expenses, negative foreign exchange impact and lower net investment income.Story continuesCapital DeploymentPrudential Financial managed to return capital to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases worth $250 million and dividends worth $463 million in the second quarter.Financial UpdatePRU exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $14,652 million, which decreased from $17,251 million at 2022-end. Total debt balance of $19.6 billion decreased from $20.7 billion at 2022-end.As of Jun 30, 2023, Prudential Financial’s assets under management and administration increased 1.7% year over year to $1.6 trillion. Adjusted book value per common share, a measure of the company’s net worth, was $97.38, which decreased 0.5% year over year. Operating return on average equity was 12.2% in the second quarter, which improved 280 basis points year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Prudential has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

(NYSE:URI) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United RentalsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO, Dale Asplund, for US$5.8m worth of shares, at about US$436 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$477, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was 52% of Dale Asplund's holding.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of United Rentals shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does United Rentals Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. United Rentals insiders own 0.5% of the company, currently worth about US$147m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About United Rentals Insiders?The fact that there have been no United Rentals insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the United Rentals insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing United Rentals.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence market, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Artificial intelligence has been all the hype so far in 2023. Every notable tech company is trying to roll out advanced artificial intelligence products and services, while every consumer and investor is obsessively following AI-related news to keep apprised of how this technology develops and evolves even further. With rising interest in this technology, companies investing in this space are trying to make the most out of the artificial intelligence craze, as recent moves by several big tech names have shown.Competition In The AI SpaceAn example of one such company is that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The tech giant has recently announced that it is now going to be offering the company's Duet AI, a technology that is introducing generative AI applications to the Google suite of products, generally in Google Workspace. It is charging large businesses about $30 per month for each user making use of its artificial intelligence enhancements, which are being added to Gmail and other Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) productivity apps. The technology is being offered with a free trial before the paid subscription begins, allowing users to get a feel of what they can accomplish on their Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) applications with this technology incorporated in them. According to the company's announcement, a consumer version of Duet AI is expected to be made available in Google Workspace early in 2024, leaving those who are following the news closely in anticipation of the transformations they can expect from this tech.Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Duet AI is set to rival its competitor Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 Copilot enhancements in both pricing and user experience. The rivalry between the two big tech companies really goes to show how neither wants to be left in the dust by the other, leading both to continue working on and investing in AI-related products and services to make them readily available to their respective consumers. While companies are busy competing with each other over besting the other in the AI race, investors are in a panic over how to invest in this space to make the most of the AI boom we have been seeing. Considering this, here are some comments from CNBC's Financial Advisor Council member, Barry Glassman, about artificial intelligence, made this August:Story continues""AI has the potential to transform every company and how we go about the world. I believe AI is going to be as transformative as the internet itself. There's going to be distruptions just like the internet, there are going to sectors, industries, companies that fail because AI is just too easy and cheap. But at the same time, the overall productivity of the US and global economy, I think is going to take leaps and leaps so that we get so much more done and so many more innovations that the economy as a whole will benefit.""Niche Players Or Outliers?On the subject of how to invest in AI, Glassman said the following:""The niche players early on may not, in fact, be the long-term plays. For example, the early internet investments like AOL and Cisco were phenomenal in the first few years - they weren't the major players over the next 10 or 20. The same was true during the pandemic stocks... Even the non-AI companies, even the non-technology companies, they're going to benefit so much from this technology that I'm not sure it makes sense to just invest in the niche players in today's market.""Investors can thus benefit from taking a broader view of the market to find outliers that have the potential to benefit from AI alongside companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) that are right in the middle of the AI boom. Considering the above, we have gone through Goldman Sachs' AI stock picks to give investors an idea of what sort of companies institutional investors are leaning toward in this space today. These include top AI stock picks for the long term alongside many cheap AI stocks.Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksCopyright: kentoh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' second-quarter 13F holdings to pick 10 AI stocks based on the investor's stakes in them.

Demand was weaker in all markets except auto. While revenue was down 11% due to the slowing economy, we believe the outlook is positive.

We also trimmed our weighting in Accenture, our second trim in the past four months, as the company returns to a normal growth trajectory after an extended stretch of robust results brought about by the pandemic. In addition to growth normalizing, we see increased signs of slowing enterprise tech spending.

313,0678d7d4-e063-3e96-9287-ade29e4c64fb,ORCL,2023-09-01,Investors Heavily Search Oracle Corporation (ORCL): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-oracle-corporation-130010948.html,1693486810,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Oracle (ORCL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this software maker have returned +4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Oracle belongs, has lost 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.15 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Oracle.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Oracle, the consensus sales estimate of $12.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.8%. The $53.85 billion and $57.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.8% and +7.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $13.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. EPS of $1.67 for the same period compares with $1.54 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was +5.7%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our discussion on the semiconductor market, head directly to 5 Best Semiconductor ETFs. Ever since the world has moved towards digital transformation, the semiconductor market has created quite the buzz. Semiconductors are crucial components for technology, be it smartphones, computers, electric vehicles, or healthcare, the demand for semiconductors is immense. While the demand for semiconductors was always high, the pandemic induced a global shortage. According to S&amp;P Global, the industry generally operated a just-in-time inventory system, which meant that raw materials were acquired as per sale orders. However, as the world was locked down during the pandemic, the industry experienced a major supply chain disruption. Not only was transportation halted, but as the world moved towards an online model, the demand for electronic devices soared. Consequently, this caused major delays in production for components used in electronics. While industries operated at roughly 80% of their utilization before the pandemic, companies still struggled to cope with the post-pandemic demand, despite operating at 95% capacity. Don't Miss: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeAccording to the The Semiconductor Industry Association, chip sales have decreased by roughly 22% in 2023, as compared to the previous year. As of April 2023, the global semiconductor market reported sales worth $40 billion, which increased merely 0.3% than that of March 2023. This figure was over $50.9 billion in April 2022. While monthly sales have increased in China and Japan – Europe, Asia, and America have all experienced declines. As per World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), the industry is expected to bounce back in 2024. As of May 2023, WSTS expects the market to grow by nearly 12% in 2024. While semiconductor usage is expected to increase in all major categories, this increase will be driven by the Memory segment, which is expected to rise by 40% over the year. Story continuesAs reported by Fortune Business Insights, the semiconductor market size was estimated at almost $528 billion in 2021. This is expected to grow to nearly $1381 billion over the next 7 years. This can be generally attributed to the increased dependence on the internet-of-things. While the automotive industry continues to grow, innovation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing is only going to boost the demand for integrated chips. Also Read: 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI BoomRecently, KPMG interviewed over 150 executives in the semiconductor space. According to their reports, 81% of the executives expect revenues to increase, as supply chain issues start to ease up in 2023. As per Mark Gibson, the Global Sector Head of Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications at KPMG International, the industry’s expectations of an increase in revenue hint that companies are “almost at the point of having excess inventory”. Mr. Gibson considers this a step in the right direction, as supply chain constraints alleviate over the next few months. In line with this, Gartner reported that while the demand for computers and smartphones stabilize, the industrial, automotive, and military sectors are set to dominate the demand. This means that the semiconductor industry is expected to experience more business spending than consumer spending. This article discusses some of the best semiconductor ETFs that provide investors with access to market leaders like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).Our Methodology We used an ETF screener and filtered out the best performing semiconductor ETFs based on 5-year share price performance.

The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's deep dive into McDonald's Corps dividend performance and assess its sustainability.Introducing McDonald's CorpWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with GM. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?McDonald's is the largest restaurant owner-operator in the world, with 2022 system sales of $116 billion (by our estimates) across more than 40,000 stores and 115 markets. McDonald's pioneered the franchise model, building its footprint through partnerships with independent restaurant franchisees and master franchise partners around the globe. The firm earns nearly 60% of its revenue from franchise royalty fees and lease payments, with most of the remainder coming from company-operated stores across its three core segments: the United States, internationally operated markets, and international developmental/licensed markets.McDonald's Corp (MCD): A Deep Dive into Its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityA Look at McDonald's Corp's Dividend HistoryMcDonald's Corp's dividend history showcases a firm commitment to rewarding shareholders. The company's Dividends Per Share has seen consistent increments over the years, indicating a solid dividend distribution approach. McDonald's Corp has increased its dividend each year since 1977, earning the title of a dividend aristocrat, an honor bestowed to companies that have consistently increased their dividend each year for at least the past 46 years.McDonald's Corp (MCD): A Deep Dive into Its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityUnderstanding McDonald's Corp's Dividend Yield and GrowthThe company's 3-year and 5-year dividend growth rates illuminate its commitment to enhance shareholder returns. McDonald's Corp's dividend has changed by 6.20% per year on average over the past three years, a performance that outperforms approximately 64.81% of global competitors. Over the past five years, the company's dividend has increased by approximately 8.00% per year on average. Based on McDonald's Corp's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of McDonald's Corp stock as of today is approximately 3.09% per year.Story continuesMcDonald's Corp (MCD): A Deep Dive into Its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityAssessing Dividend Sustainability: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityWhen evaluating the sustainability of the dividend, the company's payout ratio is a critical factor. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, McDonald's Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.55.McDonald's Corp's profitability rank of 8 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30 suggests good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability. Additionally, the predictability rank of 2 stars out of 5 suggests that revenue and earnings growth of McDonald's Corp is not consistent.McDonald's Corp's Growth Metrics: A Peek into the FutureFor dividends to be sustainable, a company must exhibit robust growth metrics. McDonald's Corp's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests a good growth trajectory relative to its competitors. The company's revenue per share and 3-year revenue growth rate indicate a strong revenue model, with an average increase of approximately 3.80% per year, a rate that outperforms approximately 68.28% of global competitors. McDonald's Corp's 3-year EPS growth rate and 5-year EBITDA growth rate further underline its growth potential, outperforming approximately 44.64% and 59.55% of global competitors, respectively.Concluding ThoughtsWith a consistent dividend payment history, robust dividend growth rate, a healthy payout ratio, and promising profitability and growth metrics, McDonald's Corp presents a compelling case for dividend investors. However, the company's inconsistent revenue and earnings growth warrant caution. As always, investors should conduct their due diligence before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -1.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which McDonald's falls in, has lost 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.98 per share, indicating a change of +11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.49 points to a change of +13.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.41 indicates a change of +8% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.56 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $25.46 billion and $27.37 billion estimates indicate +9.8% and +7.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $3.17 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.31%. The EPS surprise was +14.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.McDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Paying a dividend while unprofitable is generally considered an aggressive policy, and with limited funds retained for reinvestment, growth may be slow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 53%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.28 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakySome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings per share has shrunk at 12% a year over the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesSeagate Technology Holdings' Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Paccar and Tesla are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PCAR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.68, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 74.02. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.97. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.39.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.87. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 15.71.Based on these metrics and many more, PCAR holds a Value grade of A, while TSLA has a Value grade of D.Story continuesPCAR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Investors will also notice that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.12. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's industry has an average PEG of 2.75 right now. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.15.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 2.87. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 4.98. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.11 and as low as 2.26, with a median of 2.77, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.33. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.09.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.67. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 19.62. Within the past 12 months, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.24 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 9.97.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that PACCAR is likely undervalued currently.

That reputation for resilience will be tested again.A new five-year contract with the Teamsters union, ratified by the union’s rank-and-file Aug. 22, imposes a significant cost burden on UPS (NYSE: UPS) during its first year. The initial payout, which has been estimated at an 8%-9% increase over the prior contract’s most recent levels, is retroactive to Aug. 1.UPS will try to extract higher prices from its customers to recoup those higher costs, amid a cycle of slowing demand for parcel delivery services and increasing competition from regional carriers, parcel consolidators and most recently from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which announced in August that it would restart its long-dormant stand-alone shipping service.At the same time, UPS is trying to recover traffic that skittish shippers diverted to rivals during the noisy pre-contract negotiation process, as well as win volumes that shippers were originally expected to tender but subsequently withdrew out of an abundance of caution.UPS must also respond to rival FedEx Corp.’s (NYSE: FDX) announcement this week of a 5.9% noncontract rate increase — known in the trade as “general rate increases” — on its 2024 FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services. That is 100 basis points below the record 6.9% rate hike that both carriers imposed in 2023.Tariff rates serve as a benchmark for the contractual agreements that dominate the parcel industry. The prices that customers actually pay will vary widely depending on multiple factors. For example, rates on certain shipments may exceed 5.9%, while rates on others may drop below that threshold, thus neutralizing each other and resulting in a 5.9% overall increase. Delivery surcharges, which have grown in number and cost, will likely take up many shipper rates by 10% year on year, said Branden Burt, director of parcel operations for consultancy TransImpact LLC.Story continuesWith current inflation rates abating over 2022 levels, FedEx’s lower GRI threshold could not have been all that much of a surprise. Still, the timing of the move left some wondering if FedEx was sending a shot across the bow at UPS and if it was intent on keeping UPS’ business that came its way in the months leading up to the contract’s ratification.In a research note, Ken Hoexter, analyst at Bank of America, said that FedEx appears “poised to set a market ceiling in the global integrator sector, potentially limiting UPS’ ability to offset steep year 1 Teamster pay increases” in the contract.Ronald Leibman, partner and head, transportation, logistics and supply chain management group for the law firm McCarter &amp; English LLP, said it is “more likely” that UPS’ GRI will exceed FedEx’s because of the cost pressures emanating from the Teamsters contract.When calculating its GRI, UPS will need to balance its higher cost to serve with concerns that it may alienate shippers it is trying to win back. Under current market conditions, it will be difficult for UPS to move much above FedEx’s GRI, if it can at all. Nate Skiver, head of consultancy LPF Spend Management LLC, said stagnant volumes don’t justify it. Burt, who forecast a 5.9% increase for FedEx, expects UPS to match FedEx in part because decelerating inflation makes anything above that threshold implausible.Scott Lord, a former UPS executive who now runs Strategic Growth Advisory LLC, a consultancy, expects UPS to clock in with a 6.9% rate increase in part because tight capacity gives shippers little leverage. That view runs counter to estimates from SJ Consulting, another consultancy, that daily capacity currently exceeds 110 million parcels while daily demand is a little more than half that.UPS is highly skilled at growing per-package revenue without straight rate hikes and will no doubt leverage those capabilities to build profitable revenue absent a sky-high GRI, experts said. UPS often ties shipper discounts to strict revenue commitments, an approach that Skiver said effectively locks in customers for the duration of a contract. Skiver also said that he expects UPS to be “selectively aggressive” in order to regain large shipper business, but that it won’t fully open the spigots just to fill the network. “It’s not their approach,” he said.In addition, UPS is gradually parting ways with Amazon, which remains UPS’ largest customer but which generally tenders it lower-yielding traffic. UPS will replace that business with higher-margin business from small and midsize (SMB) customers, Skiver said. “This affords UPS the flexibility to backfill Amazon revenue with a combination of high-yield volume from SMBs and ‘aggressively discounted’ enterprise retailer volume,” Skiver said.While UPS has much ground to cover to replace lost revenue and cover increased labor expenses, “I don’t think they need to do it through a higher GRI,” he said.Lord said UPS will continue to work toward improving the profitability of its relationships with large shippers. “I am sure that UPS has been either removing rate caps” — which are maximum allowed annual rate increases allowed under contract — “or increasing what the caps are,” Lord said. Traditionally, the rate caps have been in the 3% range, but Lord surmised they are hitting the 4% range or higher.UPS is also extremely proficient at increasing surcharges to cover segments of its network that have higher costs to serve, such as residential deliveries, Lord said. In addition, UPS will tout its reputation as a premium service provider to convince shippers that the company offers a superior value proposition to FedEx, he said.UPS declined comment for this story. Around mid-September, it is expected to hold an in-depth analyst meeting to discuss the contract’s impact. In a statement, FedEx said “this year’s adjustments reflect our intent to support our customers by continuing to deliver outstanding service at competitive rates.” FedEx will provide more detail on its pricing moves on Sept. 7.In its GRI announcement, FedEx said it would also raise rates on its Ground Economy product but declined to be specific. Ground Economy is designed to handle lightweight, non-urgent parcels at low rates. Because it competes with UPS’ SurePost product managed in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Service’s last-mile delivery network, those changes will be keenly monitored, especially since language in the Teamsters contract calls for diverting as much as 50% of SurePost volumes from the Postal Service to UPS Teamster drivers by the end of the contract.The post With FedEx GRI in books, ball now in UPS’ court appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

As part of our effort to efficiently manage our airline, we are offering a voluntary separation benefit to eligible UPS pilots,” UPS (NYSE: UPS) said in an emailed statement. “Those who choose to accept the offer will receive a comprehensive compensation package that includes cash and healthcare benefits.”UPS did not disclose specific details of the offer.UPS reduced its flight activity in July by 14% from the prior month, and flight hours were down 13% year over year, according to tracking data compiled by Morgan Stanley.UPS reported second-quarter domestic next-day air revenue fell 9.4% on a 12% drop in volume. Management attributed a large chunk of the domestic decline to customers trading down to UPS’ lower-cost ground network.Within the United States, UPS is adjusting package flows to maximize utilization of Next Day Air flights, which enables it to reduce block hours — time in flight and taxiing at the airport — in the two-day operation. By filling overnight flights from its Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky, it has reduced the need to operate as many daytime flights. CFO Brian Newman said the changes resulted in domestic flight hours that were 6.5% lower versus the 2022 quarter.UPS began retiring its fleet of older MD-11 aircraft in January. A total of 42 tri-jet freighters will be discharged over the next few years and replaced by 28 new Boeing 767 medium widebody aircraft, the first six of which are scheduled for delivery this year. The 767s offer lower operating costs, with better reliability and fewer emissions.Louisville TV station WDRB was first to report the UPS effort to downsize crew levels at its cargo airline.

In the long term, the company foresees earnings growth in the mid-teens.American Express — with a market cap of $118 billion — is a diversified financial services company, offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining in your portfolio at the moment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXP’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $11.14 per share, indicating 13.1% year-over-year growth. The estimate has remained stable over the past week. American Express beat on earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed twice. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues stands at $60.9 billion, suggesting a 15.2% rise from the prior-year reported number. In the long run, the company expects revenue growth of more than 10%.Both Billed Business and Processed Volumes are expected to continue on their growth path in the future, boosting network volumes. Our estimate for total network volumes in 2023 indicates 11.5% year-over-year growth, signaling higher spending.We expect cards in force for 2023 to jump 9% from a year ago, accompanied by a nearly 13% increase in the average fee per card. Global Merchant and Network Services, as well as the International Card Services segment, are expected to continue witnessing growth thanks to a rise in card member spending and growing network volumes.AXP’s focus on small and medium-sized enterprises positions it well for long-term growth. It undertook a series of collaborations in a bid to solidify its digital capabilities and provide an efficient billing and payment process for clients. Deals with Envestnet | Yodlee, Bluechain and Plaid are helping the company in this regard.Story continuesIts moves like launching new products and expanding its presence in an existing market are noteworthy. This month, its subsidiary American Express Canada introduced the facility of tap to pay across the network of the public transit services provider, Toronto Transit Commission. This will help in expanding American Express’ network, address the everyday spending needs of its Cardmembers and boost its card-issuing business.Key Risks   However, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on.Rising expenses are lowering its margins. Last year, expenses jumped 24.1% year over year. We expect total expenses for 2023 to jump almost 12% year over year due to higher Card Member Rewards, Business Development costs, Data Processing and Equipment costs.Also, American Express’ 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple of 13.3X is higher than 11.8X of the industry, making it a little expensive at the current level. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive AXP’s growth in the long term.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are WisdomTree, Inc.

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering computer storage product requirements. These factors are favorable for prominent industry players like NetApp NTAP, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Teradata TDC. The democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G, will likely act as a tailwind for industry participants. The rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, cautious IT spending amid global macroeconomic turbulence is a significant headwind in the near term, along with volatile supply chain dynamics and inflation.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.4 Trends Shaping the Computer - Storage Industry's FutureNew Normal Trends &amp; Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: Implementation of hybrid work models has triggered the demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Adequate storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones. The accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance have led to a data explosion for enterprises.Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Broader storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth owing to a rapid increase in data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, a positive for industry players.Macro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending in the Near Term: Weakening IT spending amid global macroeconomic weakness is likely to remain a headwind in the near term. Increased budget scrutiny, especially cloud-cost optimization by clients and forex volatility are affecting the top-line performance of the industry participants. Consumer spending cuts on purchasing PCs, tablets and printers will likely hinder IT spending growth. In the long run, higher technology spending on transformation projects, including data security, application modernization, analytics and AI by enterprises, augurs well for industry participants.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments declined 16.6% to 59.7 million units in the second quarter of 2023, according to the data compiled by Gartner. Global macroeconomic weakness and inflationary pressure are leading to careful IT spending by business organizations. A slowing PC market does not augur well for the industry participants. However, Gartner expects PC inventory to normalize by the end of this year while PC demand is expected to return to growth in 2024.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector.

Shares have lost about 4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is JBT due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.John Bean Q2 Earnings Up Y/Y on Strong FoodTech ResultsJohn Bean Technologies reported adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share in second-quarter 2023, which came in 11.5% higher than the prior-year quarter. High order levels, improved price-cost realization, lower discretionary costs, and gains from the company’s restructuring actions were instrumental in driving the improved results in the quarter. JBT also completed the sale of the AeroTech segment, fulfilling its target to become a pure-play provider of food and beverage solutions.On a reported basis, the company’s earnings per share (from continuing operations) were 87 cents, compared with the prior-year quarter’s earnings per share of 80 cents.AeroTech Sale CompletedJBT closed the previously-announced sale of the AeroTech segment to Oshkosh Corporation for $800 million. Effective second quarter, AeroTech's financial results have been classified as discontinued operations.John Bean expects net proceeds (after taxes and transaction costs) to be around $650 million, which will be utilized toward repaying debt and investing in strategic acquisition.Higher Orders Drive RevenuesRevenues of $428 million increased 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. Organic growth was 2% in the quarter while acquisitions contributed 8%. However, unfavorable foreign currency impacted sales by 1%. Higher mix of recurring revenues also aided the improvement.The top-line figure was in line with our model estimate of revenues of $429 million for the FoodTech segment. We had estimated organic growth at 5% for the segment and a contribution from acquisitions of 5.6%.In the reported quarter, the company’s orders (from continuing operations) increased 13% year over year to $445 million. The figure came in higher than our projection of orders of $423.6 million for the FoodTech segment.Backlog (from continuing operations) was $697 million at the end of the second quarter, up 4% year over year. Our projection for the FoodTech segment’s backlog was at $673 million.Story continuesMargin ExpansionThe cost of sales increased 6% year over year to $281 million in the second quarter. Gross profit was up 14% year over year to $146 million. The gross margin was 34.2%, compared with the year-earlier quarter’s figure of 32.7%.Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 4.7% year over year to $100 million. Adjusted operating profit improved 40% year over year to $46 million from the prior-year quarter’s $33 million. Adjusted operating margin was 10.7%, compared with 8.3% in the second quarter of 2022.In the quarter under review, adjusted EBITDA was around $71.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 34%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.7%, compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of 13.5%.  Excluding corporate related costs, the adjusted EBITDA margin for JBT's FoodTech operations was 19.7%. The figure was higher than the company’s guidance of 18-18.75% and our model estimate of 18%.Financial PerformanceJohn Bean reported cash and cash equivalents of $43 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023, down from $72 million at the end of 2022. The company generated around $63 million in cash from operating activities in the six-month period ended Jun 30, 2023, compared with $75 million in the prior-year period.The company’s total debt was $951 million as of Jun 30 2023, down from $975 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Liquidity, as of the end of the second quarter, was $600 million (prior to the sale of the AeroTech segment).Guidance for 2023The company expects revenues in 2023 to be in the range of $ $1,670 - $1,720 million.  Adjusted earnings per share is projected to be between $3.80 - $4.05. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated within $263-$278 million.For the third quarter, revenues are expected to be in the range of $410 million to $425 million.  Adjusted EBITDA will range between $63 million and $68 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share to be between 90 cents and $1.05 for third-quarter 2023.The company stated that during this year, it will be initiating additional restructuring actions and the same will be around $11 - $13 million. This brings the total cost of its existing restructuring program to $16 - $18 million. The company expects annualized run-rate savings of $18 - $20 million by mid-2024 stemming from these actions.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -32.22% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, JBT has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B.

TSCO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSCOUnveiling the Investment Potential of Tractor Supply Co (TSCO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Financial Metrics and Competitive StrengthsDecoding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Tractor Supply Co's GF Score components are as follows:1. Financial strength rank: 6/102. Profitability rank: 10/103. Growth rank: 10/104. GF Value rank: 6/105. Momentum rank: 7/10Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis. Through backtesting, we know that each of these key aspects has a different impact on the stock price performance. Thus, they are weighted differently when calculating the total score. With a high profitability rank and a slightly lower financial strength rank, GuruFocus assigned Tractor Supply Co the GF Score of 96 out of 100, which signals the highest outperformance potential.Understanding Tractor Supply Co's BusinessTractor Supply Co, with a market cap of $23.57 billion and sales of $14.76 billion, is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States.

A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is computed based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to our valuation method, Tractor Supply Co (NASDAQ:TSCO) is estimated to be modestly undervalued. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. At its current price of $216.92 per share, Tractor Supply Co has a market cap of $23.60 billion. Because Tractor Supply Co is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Tractor Supply Co (TSCO)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Examining Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to check its financial strength. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are great indicators of a company's financial strength. Tractor Supply Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.13, which is worse than 77.18% of 1100 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry.

Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Tractor Supply Co is 22.3%, which ranks better than 83.97% of 1048 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 26.8%, which ranks better than 77.05% of 902 companies in the Retail - Cyclical industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to look at its profitability.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has gained 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share, indicating a change of -62.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.81 points to a change of -59.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.44 indicates a change of +42.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -24.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $28.39 billion and $30.62 billion estimates indicate -23.5% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $6.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.3%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $3.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.95%. The EPS surprise was -2.86%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

348,9675e1de-db3f-38ed-a978-70e11a6d6416,COF,2023-09-01,Smucker sees stickiness in high prices for most packaged foods,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smucker-sees-stickiness-high-prices-182053255.html,1693506053,STORY,"['KC=F', 'SJM']","[Smucker highlights sticky pricesWith the prices of many commodities and unprocessed foods coming down, it’s natural to wonder whether CPGs would respond by reducing prices to compete for volume. In response to an analyst’s question on Tuesday’s earnings call, Mark Smucker, CEO of the J.M. Smucker Co., said that in general, he is not seeing price reductions in the packaged foods industry. The general lack of elasticity in CPG explains why — for instance, Smucker’s comparable net sales grew 6.5% in the most recent quarter despite a 4% price increase with a 2.5% sales boost from volume and mix.Coffee futures are at their lowest levels since mid-2021, and that is being partially passed through to consumers. The price relief in that category is an exception to most other CPG items. (Chart: Barchart.com Inc.)Packaged coffee is one exception where prices are more of a pass-through of commodity costs than other packaged consumables that require more processing. The executive noted that his company’s costs remain inflationary in total and the company is now fully offsetting cost inflation through price increases — that was reflected by the company increasing its gross profit margin guidance to the high end of its prior range (from 36.5%-37% to about 37%). Smucker, and most other CPGs, endured severe margin pressure during the pandemic and the period of heightened inflation that started in early 2021, and retail prices have finally risen to the point where inflation is being offset relative to the year-ago period.Instacart prospectus touts benefits of targeted online advertising(Image: SEC.GOV)Twelve percent of grocery sales now come from e-commerce, a quadrupling in share since before the pandemic and a trend that appears sticky as consumers become addicted to the convenience. So far, CPG companies have migrated about 25% of their advertising spending online, which suggests there is considerable room for growth in the space.In addition to providing material required by the Securities and Exchange Commission for prospective initial public offering investors (such as showing that Instacart was profitable in 2022 and in the first half of 2023), Instacart’s prospectus published Friday highlights why CPG companies may want to advertise with the company. According to the grocery e-commerce enabler, CPG companies typically see a 15% increase in sales on the platform after using targeted advertisements, with some experiencing boosts twice that large. Pepsi is investing $175 million in Instacart as part of a private placement. Other major CPG brands that advertise on the platform include Nestle and Campbell’s, while emerging clients include lesser-known Banza, Whisps and Chloe’s Fruit Pops.Story continuesGoing forward, Instacart says it plans to grow advertising dollars with emerging brands and nonfood categories that have higher advertising budgets, such as household products, pet items and personal care. In total, 5,500 brands have advertised on the platform for services that include display ads, sponsored products, brand pages, coupons and even options to buy in bulk at discounted prices (limited to items that Instacart is confident will be in stock).I recommend this article from Winsight Grocery Business, which highlights risks to investing in the offering.Warehousing capacity remains tight in many locations(Chart: SONAR)On this week’s The Stockout show, I interviewed Joe Oliaro, chief real estate officer at Wagner Logistics. Wagner Logistics is heavily involved in warehousing and works on behalf of manufacturers in a wide range of industries, including CPG and automotive. While many industry players have speculated that the extremely tight market for warehousing space during the pandemic would give rise to an overbuilding of warehouses, sharp increases in interest rates and building material prices have kept the warehousing market tight in many locations, such as California’s Inland Empire. Meanwhile, shippers’ perceptions of their own inventory levels are mixed: Some are satisfied while others say their inventories remain elevated.Warehouses are being automated at a breakneck pace, which, for Wagner, has led to incredible improvement in picking efficiency. Still, not all processes can be automated, and the availability of needed warehouse workers remains tight, as it has always been.

Our article on the release can be found here.My favorite is the above chart on Total Trucking Authorities in the U.S. While a count of trucking authorities doesn’t tell you how many trucks are in the fleets, most of the new entrants were very small fleets or even previous company drivers who recently got their operating authority. In short, the chart suggests that lots of capacity still needs to come out of the market for it to be a healthy market for small carriers that rely on the spot market.To subscribe to The Stockout, FreightWaves’ CPG supply chain newsletter, click here.The post Smucker sees stickiness in high prices for most packaged foods appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Shares have lost about 0.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Incyte due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Beats on Q2 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesIncyte reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. The company recorded earnings of $1.01 per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues came in at $954.6 million, up 5% year over year. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $920 million owing to higher net product revenues from Jakafi and Opzelura.Quarter in DetailJakafi’s (a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for polycythemiavera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease) revenues came in at almost $682.3 million, up 14% from the year-ago quarter’s number. This was primarily driven by growth in patient demand across all indications. Jakafi's sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $647 million.Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream generated $80 million in sales. The figure grew almost 384% year over year and beat the consensus estimate of $78 million. This was due to growth in patient demand and label expansion in the indication of atopic dermatitis (AD).In July 2022, the FDA approved Opzelura cream 1.5% for the topical treatment of non-segmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Opzelura is also approved by the FDA for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate AD.The newly approved medicine, Zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr), generated first-quarter sales of $0.57 million. The company obtained an accelerated approval of Zynyz earlier in March for treating metastatic or recurrent locally advanced merkel cell carcinoma. Story continuesNet product revenues of Iclusig were almost $29.09 million, up 11% year over year. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.53 million.Pemazyre generated $21.6 million in sales, indicating a year-over-year increase of 14%. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.05 million.Minjuvi's revenues totaled $13.16 million, up 198% from the prior-year quarter’s number. The revenues significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.89 million.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country. The drug’s royalty revenues from Novartis for commercialization in ex-U.S. markets surged 8% to $90.5 million. Jakavi royalties beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 million.Incyte also receives royalties from sales of Tabrecta (capmatinib) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Its partner, Novartis, has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights for Tabrecta. The drug’s product royalty revenues amounted to $4.8 million, up 34% year over year.Olumiant’s (baricitinib) product royalty revenues totaled $32.01 million, up 6% year over year. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.83 million.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly for Olumiant. The drug is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to LLY. It is approved for several types of autoimmune diseases.Adjusted research and development expenses totaled $367.9 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter’s actual, owing to higher investments in late-stage pipeline development. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $263 million, up 12% from the prior-year quarter’s number. This was due to expenses related to supporting the launch of Opzelura for the treatment of vitiligo.Incyte’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.4 billion as of Jun 30, 2023 compared with $3.1 billion as of Mar 31, 2023.2023 Guidance UpdatedBased on its second-quarter performance, Incyte updated its previously issued guidance for 2023. The company now expects Jakafi revenues in the range of $2.58-$2.63 billion compared with the earlier projection of $2.55-$2.63 billion.Pipeline and Regulatory UpdatesEarlier yesterday, the company entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with Replimune Group, Inc. The agreement is aimed at advancing Replimune’s lead product candidate, RP1, in combination with INCB99280, Incyte’s small-molecule oral PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.The clinical study is expected to start in early 2024. Under the agreement, Incyte will initiate and sponsor the clinical study and Replimune will supply RP1 to Incyte for the same. The companies will equally share the costs of the study.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Incyte has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Incyte has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerIncyte belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Another stock from the same industry, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), has gained 6.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.BioMarin reported revenues of $595.28 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.5%. EPS of $0.54 for the same period compares with $0.59 a year ago.For the current quarter, BioMarin is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter.

355,e5f4c288-5e6f-3551-9d45-6d86672ec1c3,INTU,2023-09-01,Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 12 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-growth-stocks-top-030336914.html,1693537416,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'NVDA', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'INTU', 'AMT', 'MRK', 'ZS', 'MA', 'SPLK', 'COST']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Goldman Sachs' top 12 growth stock picks. If you want to skip the latest about one of America's most well known banks, then head on over to Goldman Sachs Growth Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is making a lot of headlines these days, and not all of these are good. There's turmoil brewing within its walls and its chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon has continued to come under fire from a lot of quarters. 2022 wasn't kind to Goldman, as its revenue and net income dropped annually in the wake of the Federal Reserve's historic interest rate hikes. The bank's revenue for the 12 months ending in December last year stood at $47 billion and marked a sizeable drop of $12 billion. Similarly, its net income also dropped by $10 billion. This necessitated the bank to make some hard changes, one of which was reducing employee compensation.As you'd likely know if you've been reading Insider Monkey regularly, last year wasn't great for anyone who isn't a multi millionaire or a billionaire. Inflation touched a record high and right during this time, Goldman Sachs' employees also saw their compensation go down - a decision that didn't win Mr. Solomon any fans. At the center of this turmoil is the bank's much hyped Marcus division, which would provide loans to consumers and accept deposits. Goldman's reputation on Wall Street helped with the product launch and the bank soon attracted billions of dollars in deposits. It slowly expanded Marcus to include investment management and advising services. However, this is where the bank made mistakes, as it relied too much on its experience with high net worth individuals to develop profitability models for the Marcus investment division.Another mistake during this time period was Goldman's acquisition of GreenSky, a buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform. GreenSky is reported to be making hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, adding further to Mr. Solomon's woes. Seems like the Goldman boss really can't do anything right as far as sentiment in some quarters is concerned, with layoffs, Marcus, and GreenSky all heating up the pot against him.Story continuesBut wait, there's more. A big announcement that was also part of Goldman's push into the consumer world is its partnership with the Cupertino, California consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The pair partnered up in 2019 to provide the Apple Card platform, which allowed Apple customers to open savings accounts and conduct other financial actions. However, Goldman has lost billions of dollars from Apple Card, and most of these are believed to come from consumer disputes that have proven to be a bit too much for the investment bank to handle. With Apple Card's losses believed to sit at $5 billion as of late 2023, Mr. Solomon extended the partnership with Apple until 2029 in October 2022, so perhaps some of the ire directed at him does make some sense.Being on the back foot isn't great, and with August coming to an end, Goldman announced that it is selling its Personal Finance Management (PFM) business division. PFM was a wealth management unit that managed millionaires' money and Goldman's shares gained a couple of dollars on the market when the sale was announced. Year to date though the stock is down 5.35% and represents a cyclical roller coaster track that shows an inherent conflict in investors' minds when it comes to betting about the bank's future.Thought the bank's troubles were over? Think again as the Financial Times reports that the Federal Reserve has warned Goldman about its business dealings with financial technology and payments firms such as Stripe and Wise.However, even though it might very well be the case that someone has hexed Goldman Sachs, the fact still remains that its research division is one of the most credible in the world. An analyst's true test comes when he or she stands against the tide, and Goldman has been one of the very, very few in the industry that has been skeptical of a deep recession in the U.S. So, its stock picks still merit a deeper look and today we'll analyze some growth stocks. As a primer, growth stocks are those whose share price diverges significantly from the earnings per share, and if you're wondering why that is, check out 10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence market, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Artificial intelligence has been all the hype so far in 2023. Every notable tech company is trying to roll out advanced artificial intelligence products and services, while every consumer and investor is obsessively following AI-related news to keep apprised of how this technology develops and evolves even further. With rising interest in this technology, companies investing in this space are trying to make the most out of the artificial intelligence craze, as recent moves by several big tech names have shown.Competition In The AI SpaceAn example of one such company is that of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The tech giant has recently announced that it is now going to be offering the company's Duet AI, a technology that is introducing generative AI applications to the Google suite of products, generally in Google Workspace. It is charging large businesses about $30 per month for each user making use of its artificial intelligence enhancements, which are being added to Gmail and other Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) productivity apps. The technology is being offered with a free trial before the paid subscription begins, allowing users to get a feel of what they can accomplish on their Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) applications with this technology incorporated in them. According to the company's announcement, a consumer version of Duet AI is expected to be made available in Google Workspace early in 2024, leaving those who are following the news closely in anticipation of the transformations they can expect from this tech.Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Duet AI is set to rival its competitor Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 Copilot enhancements in both pricing and user experience. The rivalry between the two big tech companies really goes to show how neither wants to be left in the dust by the other, leading both to continue working on and investing in AI-related products and services to make them readily available to their respective consumers. While companies are busy competing with each other over besting the other in the AI race, investors are in a panic over how to invest in this space to make the most of the AI boom we have been seeing. Considering this, here are some comments from CNBC's Financial Advisor Council member, Barry Glassman, about artificial intelligence, made this August:Story continues""AI has the potential to transform every company and how we go about the world. I believe AI is going to be as transformative as the internet itself. There's going to be distruptions just like the internet, there are going to sectors, industries, companies that fail because AI is just too easy and cheap. But at the same time, the overall productivity of the US and global economy, I think is going to take leaps and leaps so that we get so much more done and so many more innovations that the economy as a whole will benefit.""Niche Players Or Outliers?On the subject of how to invest in AI, Glassman said the following:""The niche players early on may not, in fact, be the long-term plays. For example, the early internet investments like AOL and Cisco were phenomenal in the first few years - they weren't the major players over the next 10 or 20. The same was true during the pandemic stocks... Even the non-AI companies, even the non-technology companies, they're going to benefit so much from this technology that I'm not sure it makes sense to just invest in the niche players in today's market.""Investors can thus benefit from taking a broader view of the market to find outliers that have the potential to benefit from AI alongside companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) that are right in the middle of the AI boom. Considering the above, we have gone through Goldman Sachs' AI stock picks to give investors an idea of what sort of companies institutional investors are leaning toward in this space today. These include top AI stock picks for the long term alongside many cheap AI stocks.Goldman Sachs AI Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksCopyright: kentoh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' second-quarter 13F holdings to pick 10 AI stocks based on the investor's stakes in them.

CAH recently launched its next-generation NTrainer System 2.0. The medical device is expected to help in reducing the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) length of stay for premature and newborn infants.The NTrainer System 2.0 is currently the only FDA Class II biofeedback device designed to help newborns and infants born prematurely develop their non-nutritive sucking skills needed for independent oral feeding.The latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen Cardinal Health’s Medical business.Significance of the LaunchThe NTrainer System is expected to improve vital pre-feeding skills in newborns and preterm infants, known as non-nutritive suck (NNS). NNS is crucial for the safe transition from feeding tubes to breast or bottle. This is a developmental milestone for preterm infants and has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics as the criterion for discharge from the NICU. Cardinal Health's NTrainer has been clinically proven to improve feeding outcomes while also reducing the length of NICU stay by utilizing its patented technology for improving NNS proficiency.Also, the NTrainer System provides clinicians with the required objective data via real-time assessment technology to track the progress of an infant in developing pre-feeding skills. This is also likely to assure parent about their infants' progress and potential to thrive after discharge.Per management, the NTrainer System is expected to aid some of the most vulnerable patients at the beginning of life via the biofeedback device to improve NNS patterns in newborns and infants born prematurely.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Spherical Insights, the global biofeedback instrument market was valued at $165.4 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $263.2 million by 2032 at a CAGR of approximately 4.8%. Factors like the increased prevalence of stress-related mental diseases and the growing need for improving vital pre-feeding skills in newborns and preterm infants are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest launch is likely to provide a significant boost to Cardinal Health's business.Recent Developments in Medical SegmentThis month, Cardinal Health reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it recorded a solid uptick in its overall top line.

The uptick in the overall top and bottom lines and robust performances by both segments during the quarter were impressive. The company continues to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions with new small- to mid-sized customer additions and strong win rates in core Veeva CRM looked promising.Veeva Systems registered great traction in newer areas, including Veeva Vault Safety, Vault LIMS and Veeva Compass, which augurs well. The continued momentum in CTMS and eTMF in clinical operations raises our optimism.On the flip side, the rising operating costs putting pressure on the margins during the quarter was concerning. The continued project scrutiny across the board and the challenging funding environment are putting pressure on smaller companies while some smaller companies have been acquired, sold assets or ceased operations. These dynamics are impacting some of Veeva Systems’ smaller biotech customers using its R&amp;D products.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the top 10 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USA. On 21st July 2023, seven major tech giants, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pledged a ""voluntary commitment"" to collaborate with the Biden administration to mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Following a meeting with President Joe Biden, these companies agreed to focus on safety, security, and trust in AI development. This included subjecting AI systems to external testing for safety and capabilities, safeguarding against cyber and insider threats, and ensuring that AI does not promote bias or discrimination. How Real is the AI Hype?Whenever a new technology enters the market, investors deliberate its economic implications and its potential to augment corporate profits. The hype around Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has now gained significant momentum which can be realized by the fact that it has contributed to a surge of nearly 40% in the Nasdaq Composite, in the first half of 2023. While some analysts have coined this surge as an ""A.I. gold rush,"" there are contrasting perspectives. Some believe that investors might be preemptively optimistic about the valuation of A.I-related stocks. These cautious perspectives suggest that the anticipated A.I. boom might not unfold as projected, especially concerning stock market investors.However, the analysts at Goldman Sachs present a differing view, contending that the hype about A.I. is indeed real. Kash Rangan, a software analyst at the bank, conveyed his viewpoint through an interview featured in Goldman's latest publication, ""Top of Mind."" Rangan stated, ""A.I likely isn't undergoing a period of unwarranted exaggeration. When there's a unanimous consensus within the technology provider community that a genuine technological shift is taking place, it signifies an actual transformation. Furthermore, when customer interest starts to escalate, such enthusiasm shouldn't be dismissed as mere hype. The growing interest from customers solidifies the authenticity of the trend.""

In fact, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, Ben Snider, projects a 1.5% annual productivity growth over the next decade through A.I which can potentially lead to a 30% or higher boost in S&amp;P 500 profits. To read about how AI can replace human jobs, check out our article about Jobs That Will Disappear in the Future Due to AI.To exemplify, we can look at how NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has risen as a leader in AI by spearheading the development of specialized GPUs optimized for intricate AI computations. These GPUs, built with powerful parallel processing capabilities, are exceptionally well-suited for AI tasks. With a 95% market share in the GPU sector, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominance has become more than evident, as it empowers a number of AI applications with outstanding performance and efficiency. Mairs &amp; Power, an investment advisor, released “Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund” that commented in second quarter investor letter:“Regarding stock selection in the first half, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a massive outperformer, up 189.54%. Amazon and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year. Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) computation for both learning and inferencing, and its stock rallied significantly on a massive earnings report in the first quarter as cloud data center companies invested heavily in AI.”In fact, in Q2 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue leaped to $13.5 billion, a twofold YoY increase, driving its stock up 220% since the year's start, with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. The company's specialized AI chips underscore its advantage, and thus, dominate 80% of the global market.Moreover, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s H100 chip which is vital for AI commands double its initial price due to high demand. On the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is pioneering a transformative trend with its groundbreaking ""Algorithm of Thoughts"" (AoT) which signifies a substantial leap forward in AI training. By combining human cognition and algorithmic logic, AoT aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This innovative approach, guided by in-context learning, streamlines problem-solving pathways which would result in faster and less resource-intensive outcomes. With AoT, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) envisions a more organized and systematic exploration of solutions, potentially surpassing the performance of the algorithms themselves. This marks a pertinent shift from traditional supervised learning methods to an integrated search process. As Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) drives this paradigm shift, it underscores their commitment to shaping the future of AI through innovative techniques that can revolutionize problem-solving across industries.List of 55 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USAPhoto by Possessed Photography on UnsplashMethodologyTo prepare the list of artificial intelligence companies in USA, we conducted an extensive research to find out the companies that have been highly active and innovative in the US with their AI applications.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best September Dividend Stocks To Buy.Dividend investing is a popular way to increase your earnings and generate income through investments. While it might appear straightforward to invest in stocks that pay dividends, this strategy actually involves various other aspects to consider. One approach within dividend investing is the dividend capture strategy. It involves buying a stock just before its ex-dividend date and then selling it shortly after, once the dividend has been paid. The goal is to capture the dividend payout without necessarily holding onto the stock for the long term.Investors who prefer a more active approach might find the dividend capture strategy suitable, as it involves relatively short holding periods. This can be appealing to those who don't want to commit to long-term investments. However, dividend investing offers benefits in the long run as they have the potential for capital appreciation over time. Dividends have contributed significantly to the market’s overall returns. A study by Hartford Funds revealed that from 1930 to 2019, dividends on average made up about 42% of the total returns each year. This is a yearly average of 1.8%.Another report by Wisdom Tree also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the past. According to the report, dividends played a substantial role in the S&amp;P 500's annual total returns of 10.4%, contributing almost 30%. The report also mentioned that the 2000s were the only decade when the S&amp;P 500 had negative overall returns. During this time, dividend returns of around 2% acted as a buffer, helping to counterbalance the negative price returns caused by the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the Global Financial Crisis.When investing in dividend stocks, companies that regularly grow their dividends remain on investors’ radars. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks in this regard as these companies have a history of steadily raising their dividend payments for many years.Story continues10 Best September Dividend Stocks To BuyOur Methodology:This list presents the dividend capture strategy for choosing prominent dividend stocks scheduled to go ex-dividend in September 2023.

However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 13.1%, better than 76.47% of companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCReturn on invested capital (ROIC) is a measure of how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business.

Rendering: Sunset Pier 94Most Hollywood creatives have been on strike this year, but New York is betting the entertainment industry will need state-of-the-art studio space minutes from Midtown in the near future.Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), Hudson Pacific Properties and Blackstone (BX) are joining the city in a $350 million public-private partnership to build Manhattan’s first-ever production studio center on Pier 94 on the Hudson River, the city announced Tuesday.The site, which will include a 250,000-square-foot campus with six soundstages, is expected to create 1,300 construction jobs and 400 permanent ones on the site and generate $6.4 billion within New York’s economy, according to city officials. It aims to put studio space outside the outer boroughs — where soundstages have proliferated thanks to cheaper land — and in the heart of Manhattan, making it more convenient for stars than schlepping out to Queens.“In many ways, I do think it’s a crown jewel for the city,” Melissa Román Burch, New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) chief operating officer, said. “New York City is rapidly becoming a true national and global destination for film, television and media content production, but we don’t rest on our laurels. We know it’s a competitive marketplace.”Plans to remake the Far West Side piers have been swirling for 15 years, when the EDC awarded Vornado a 49-year lease for Pier 94 and the neighboring Pier 92 in 2008, with one headline touting, “A Project That’s Actually Happening: Vornado Redoing Pier 94.”Vornado initially wanted to double the size of the pier and build a convention center that would rival the Javits Center. But the project stalled and the city determined in 2019 that Pier 92 was structurally unsound. Then the pandemic interrupted large-scale events from occurring at all.Earlier this year, Vornado renegotiated its deal with the city and came up with a new proposal for a movie studio and a longer, 99-year lease, giving Pier 92 back to the city (some real estate leaders were surprised that the city gave Vornado a deal after it did little to fix up Pier 92 for the decade it leased the site).  Story continuesVornado would own 49.9 percent of the lease and be responsible for the site’s development, while its new partners, studio owner Hudson Pacific Properties, would own 25.6 percent and oversee the design while managing leases, and Blackstone’s real estate arm would own 24.5 percent.  “Our partnership with Blackstone, Hudson Pacific and the City of New York will solidify New York as a leading market for content production and studio space, create jobs, drive economic momentum, and deliver a host of amenities to the surrounding community,” Michael Franco, president and chief financial officer at Vornado, said in a statement. “Together we’ll raise the bar for one of New York City’s signature industries and breathe new life into a key waterfront site.”The entertainment industry currently has little need for new studio space. The combined writers’ and actors’ strikes shut down dozens of productions starting in May, and shoots have not resumed at most of the city’s 60 registered production facilities that constitute almost 2 million square feet of production space. Jeff Stotland, executive vice president of global studios for Hudson Pacific, believes that pent-up demand will materialize across the country once the writers’ and actors’ strikes are resolved, putting the Manhattan studio in a position to host new productions.“Studios have seen firsthand that their success is largely reliant on continuing to produce original scripted content, and Los Angeles and New York remain the most sought-after markets for this production,” Stotland said. “We have strong conviction that the underlying fundamentals of content production will benefit the Sunset Pier 94 Studios project, as well as the rest of our growing studio platform.”Other New York production studio owners welcomed the Manhattan-based project to the city’s mix, even as the writers’ strike stretched into its fifth month.“The impact of the recent WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes have been far-reaching, but we anticipate that industry demand will continue to grow once the strikes have been resolved,” Gina Argento, president and CEO of Broadway Stages, which has studio space in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, said. “We are hopeful that any new and existing studios will also commit to supporting the local community in ways that are impactful and equitable.”Strikes aside, studio space has boomed in recent years thanks to the proliferation of streaming services like Netflix and Apple that are hungry to create compelling content to win subscribers. But, that has started to turn as streaming services dealt with a saturated market while providers faced huge losses, leading to layoffs and halted productions to cut costs.Studios also have to face the problems hitting much of the commercial real estate industry — rising interest rates, inflation, regional bank failures, declining values and dragging debt — making the market reeling even before the strikes.“Production in the U.S. has halted at a time when the sector is under pressure to mitigate the secular decline in linear TV and show it can operate streaming platforms at a profit to mitigate linear decay,” Moody’s Analytics reported. “In a prolonged strike in which new theatrical Hollywood tentpole product is spread more thinly or runs dry, these companies could face earnings, cash flow and liquidity pressures.”The Pier 94 site itself will soon be transformed regardless of the labor strife and streaming woes. Construction is expected to begin this fall as existing facilities next to the pier will be demolished for new soundstages and parking, while the pier’s warehouse will be turned into support space. The city will also be getting 25,000 square feet of waterfront space as well as an 1,850-square-foot community facility, public access to the pier, new public bathrooms, and new safety improvements to the Hudson River bikeway. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end 2025.Trending Commercial Observer StoriesShake Shack Opening Jackson Heights Outpost‘Writing Is on the Wall’ for B6 as Talent Exits Amid Financial StrugglesHouse Bill Would Create Tax Incentive for CRE Loan Modifications and Debt WorkoutsTarget to Close East Harlem Store, Blames ShopliftingCommercial Observer's Power Gala Attendees Tout Bullishness Amid ChangeRead the original story Developers Plot Manhattan’s First-Ever Film Studio as Actors Remain on Strike and others by Aaron Short at Commercial Observer.]"

They ignore this strike vote at their peril,” Julie Hedrick, APFA national president, said in announcing the vote on Aug. 30.“Our contributions to the success of American Airlines must be recognized and respected.”Last month, AA pilots voted to ratify a new and tentative four-year contract with management, as Kiplinger reported. The contract, valued at about $9 billion, was reached on Aug. 1 and includes a 21% pay hike.In an Aug. 24 statement, APFA noted that the agreement provides those pilots with a total of 46% wage increases over the duration of their contract, and said “It’s our turn and we are ready.”The APFA, which represents more than 26,000 AA flight attendants, is seeking wage increases and other provisions including boarding pay and improvements to its 401(k) plan and profit sharing benefits.“We’re proud of the progress we’ve made in negotiations with the APFA, and we look forward to reaching an agreement that provides our flight attendants with real and meaningful value,” an AA spokesperson told Kiplinger. “We understand that a strike authorization vote is one of the important ways flight attendants express their desire to get a deal done. The results don’t change our commitment or distract us from working expeditiously to reach an agreement.”More than 93% of eligible flight attendants participated in the vote, with 99.47% of them voting to authorize a strike, APFA said. The vote is an important step because it allows the union’s negotiations team to “return to the bargaining table with a clear message to management that American Airlines flight attendants are fired up and ready for our contract,” the APFA said.Story continuesThe union made a filing with the federal National Mediation Board (NMB) in April and cannot strike until the NMB releases it from mediation and following a 30-day cooling off period.“But if management continues proposing concessions coupled with meager improvements to compensation and retirement, we will not hesitate to request a release (from the NMB) to strike if necessary,” the APFA said.Airline ticket prices are fallingLast month, the NMB denied Southwest Airlines Pilots Association's request to halt contract talks with its carrier. The union, which has been in negotiations with the airline for more than three years, held strikes at Los Angeles International and several other airports on Aug. 30.Pilot strikes are historically rare, Kiplinger previously reported. The last one occurred in 2010 at Spirit Airlines. Agencies like the NMB take pains to prevent work stoppages from disrupting the flow of interstate commerce via the airline and railway industries, with Congress also sometimes stepping in.Meanwhile, while the airline industry has faced pilot shortages and a number of issues since the pandemic, it has made some progress for travelers as airline ticket prices are coming down, Kiplinger recently reported. These include prices for domestic flights, which are down from last year, as reported.RELATED CONTENTBiden Proposes New Rule to Help When Flights Get Canceled or DelayedAmerican Airlines Pilots Ratify New ContractSouthwest Pilots' Request to Halt Negotiations Denied]"

They will be taking to the skies. It's the usual chaos because all year long, it's not really seasonal. Flights have been full. Airports have been crowded and sometimes overcrowded.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And for many consumers, the southwest meltdown that we saw in December, still top of mind. We also had multiple delays this summer amid pilot and other labor shortages. What does that mean for this weekend and looking beyond into the back half of the year when it comes to some of those potential disruptions?Story continuesPETER GREENBERG: Well, beyond pilot shortages and computer meltdowns, you've got a lingering problem with the FAA. Three of the four major air traffic control centers are below their 85% staffing threshold, which means even in the best of weather, they have to slow things down because they literally do not have enough controllers to work the number of flights the airlines have scheduled.So you can expect delays just on that alone, then you throw weather in. So let's just hope there's not any weather. It'll just be slow.AKIKO FUJITA: Now, Peter, you mentioned that we're already starting to see some consumers pull back from their travel plans this time of year. What does that suggest in terms of how things are going to look come holiday season? That is another big driver for so many of these airlines.PETER GREENBERG: It is. But we have to go back to the COVID days, where so many of us came up close and personal with our own sense of personal mortality and made a decision that we were going to forego expensive material goods and new cars and clothing and jewelry. We wanted to focus on buying experiences.So all that money that was saved up during COVID was spent on that. Here's the problem. We've blown through those savings and now we're putting it on our credit cards, as you've already reported numerous times, I suspect. Consumer credit debt on credit cards is over $1 trillion.So part of that weakening and demand is because people are getting their credit card bills at 24% interest and trying to reassess what their priorities really are.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And amid a lot of those higher prices is there anything the consumer can do to try and score better deals?PETER GREENBERG: Yes, the good news is, as demand is falling, we're now starting to see drastic reductions in international affairs. Just about a month ago, a round trip ticket from New York to London in Coach was about $2,200. That's crazy. Today, I'm seeing fares starting now, not just waiting for Labor Day, down to $208 each way. And that includes taxes and fees. That's a remarkable change.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Peter, you know, we've heard so much from these airlines about the strength they're seeing in international travel versus domestic. What are you seeing going into this weekend? Where are travelers going?PETER GREENBERG: Well, most of them are not going internationally. They're coming back from their foreign vacations. Most of them are staying home close to home because of school seasons and having to start the season after Labor Day. But if you want to be a smart traveler, now's the time book international flights. As I said, that $208 example I gave you is just one of them.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. I'll have to get some notes there on where to travel internationally. CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

An example of this is an American Airlines passenger who took to Reddit to express frustration at other passengers who choose to recline their seat in the row in front of them. The passenger expressed their opinion on the matter in no uncertain terms.Continue reading]

Only a few days after the company’s pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots Association or APA, approved a four-year deal pertaining to wage increase, its flights attendants have voted to give their union, Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the power to call a strike if needed.More than 26,000 flight attendants at AAL are represented by the APFA. Highlighting their frustration at a suitable deal not being reached, 99.47% of the APFA covered flight attendants voted for a strike in the event of a contract not being agreed upon.Per APFA’s national president Julie Hedrick, ""Flight attendants are fired up and ready for a contract. They (the company) ignore this strike vote at their peril,"", national president of APFA, said in a statement. In the event of AAL’s management and APFA failing to come to an agreement through federal mediation, the latter can request to be released into a 30-day cooling-off period. Following the expiry of that period, the attendants may commence a strike.Even though flight attendants have voted in favor of a strike, it is highly doubtful whether the same will materialize, as the law makes it extremely difficult. So, negotiations are likely to continue. The union hopes that this strike approval will exert pressure on AAL in ongoing negotiations. Naturally, we expect investors to eagerly wait for further updates on this crucial issue.With U.S. airlines grappling with labor shortages, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased as air-travel demand is buoyant, having bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows. As a result, we are seeing many labor deals being inked in the space. Apart from AAL’s deal with pilots, referred to above, in July, United Airlines’ UAL pilots provisionally agreed on a multi-billion-dollar contract to increase their pay up to 40% over the four-year duration of the contract. In March, Delta Air Lines’ DAL pilots ratified a four-year deal, which made DAL’s pilots eligible for a 34% pay-hike over the next four years.Story continuesAmerican Airlines and Delta carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each while United Airlines currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

376,c764c56c-b126-3f83-a2bf-14db1eff1fe2,AAL,2023-09-01,Busy Labor Day Weekend Awaits US Airlines: 3 Stocks to Watch,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/busy-labor-day-weekend-awaits-121000635.html,1693483800,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL']","[It is a well-documented fact that air travel demand has bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows. Driven by the buoyant passenger volumes in the current summer season, which has been the busiest one ever, the upcoming Labor Day holiday period is expected to be a very busy one for U.S. airlines.The bullish expectation of the Transportation Security Administration or TSA pertaining to traffic volumes during the Labor Day holiday weekend further highlights the encouraging scenario. Therefore, we believe that investors interested in the industry would do well to keep U.S. airline stocks like United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Delta Air Lines DAL on their radar.With people taking to the skies in a big way in the post-COVID period, the airline industry, one of the hardest hit corners in the pandemic peak, is currently in good shape. Driven by the concept of ‘Revenge travel’, a term emanating from the prolonged periods of lockdown, people remain eager to undertake a flight despite headwinds like flight disruptions caused by labor shortages. Revenge travel highlights a strong desire to travel in response to the monotony and exhaustion of life caused by the COVID-19-induced lockdown.Driven by the travel surge, the Federal Aviation Administration expects the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend to be the third busiest one in 2023 so far, after the Juneteenth weekend, which was inclusive of Father's Day, and the break for Presidents Day.The TSA’s ProjectionThe TSA anticipates screening more than 14 million passengers in the Sep 1-Sep 6 period, despite the likely disruptions caused by the tropical storm Idalia. The busiest day during the period is likely to be Sep 1. On that day, TSA expects to screen more than 2.7 million travelers passing through security checkpoints.Per TSA administrator David Pekoske, “We anticipate this Labor Day holiday weekend will be busy, with passenger volumes nearly 11% higher than last year, volumes that already exceeded 2019 Labor Day holiday travel volumes.”Story continuesHighlighting the upbeat air-travel demand scenario, the TSA stated that it has screened approximately 227.5 million passengers since the Memorial Day weekend. This translates into an average of 2.5 million per day. To aid travel, many U.S. airlines are offering low fares for passengers who book their travel by Labor Day.Given this rosy scenario, we have highlighted three airline stocks, that investors should keep tabs on.Our ChoicesUnited Airlines: UAL is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and international air travel demand. Anticipating to be extremely busy over the Labor Day holiday period, UAL’s management expects that nearly 2.8 million passengers will travel by its flights in the Aug 31-Sep 5 period.Riding on the buoyant air traffic scenario, UAL shares have gained 32.9% year to date. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other occasion. The average beat was 17.2%. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereAmerican Airlines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. To meet the anticipated demand swell over the Aug 31-Sep 5 period, AAL aims to operate approximately 32,000 flights during this period. The carrier expects that nearly 3.5 million passengers will travel by its flights in the above timeframe.AAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the last four quarters, with an average of 19.2%. AAL shares have gained 16.1% year to date.Delta Air Lines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is likely to aid Delta in attracting significant traffic during the Labor Day holiday period.DAL surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark on the other two occasions.

(NASDAQ:PFG) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Principal Financial Group's shares on or after the 6th of September, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.65 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.60 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Principal Financial Group has a trailing yield of 3.3% on the current stock price of $77.71. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Principal Financial Group paid out a comfortable 39% of its profit last year.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. So we're not too excited that Principal Financial Group's earnings are down 3.7% a year over the past five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Principal Financial Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIs Principal Financial Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have shrunk noticeably in recent years, although we like that the company has a low payout ratio. This could suggest a cut to the dividend may not be a major risk in the near future. We're unconvinced on the company's merits, and think there might be better opportunities out there.If you want to look further into Principal Financial Group, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Eaton (ETN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ETN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Eaton's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Eaton's main business drivers.Dublin, Ireland-based Eaton Corporation plc is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems. It sells products in more than 175 countries and has 92,000 employees. The company was founded in 1916.Eaton’s current reportable segments post closure of the Hydraulics segment on Aug 2, 2021 are Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility.The Electrical Americas segment includes sales contracts that are primarily for electrical and industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, residential products, single and three-phase power quality, wiring devices, circuit protection, utility power distribution, power reliability equipment, as well as services that are primarily produced and sold in North and South America. The Electrical Global segment consists of the same activities as mentioned in Electrical Americas but are primarily produced and sold outside of North and South America.Vehicle segment includes the company's erstwhile truck and automotive segments. The truck segment designs, manufactures and markets powertrain systems and other components for commercial vehicle markets. Aerospace segment is a supplier of aerospace fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use.The eMobility segment focus on two technologies within electrical vehicles, namely Power electronics &amp; conversion and Power distribution &amp; circuit protection.Eaton's segments — Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility — contributed 41%, 28.2%, 14.6%, 13.6% and 2.6%, respectively to 2022 revenues.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Eaton a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in August 2013 would be worth $3,633.61, or a gain of 263.36%, as of August 31, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 176.48% and gold's return of 32.72% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for ETN.Eaton’s second-quarter earnings and sales were better than expected. The ongoing research and development are allowing it to develop products for providing efficient power management solutions. Eaton will benefit from the improving end market conditions and contribution from its organic assets which will assist it to retain a strong market position. ETN is expanding via strategic acquisitions and its rising backlog shows strong demand for its products. Eaton's strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it to cut costs. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. Yet, ETN’s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, changes in tax rates and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operationsThe stock has jumped 5.12% over the past four weeks.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Aflac's Q2 Earnings Beat on Lower Benefits and ClaimsAflac reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.58, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.3%. The bottom line increased 7.5% year over year.The strong second-quarter earnings were supported by higher sales, reduced benefits and claims, and improved profit levels from U.S. businesses. However, the positives were partially offset by lower net investment income and tepid performance in the Japan unit.Aflac’s revenues dropped 2.7% year over year to $5,172 million in the quarter under review. The top line, however, beat the consensus mark by 14.5%.Notable Q2 PerformanceAdjusted net investment income fell 3% year over year to $892 million.Total net benefits and claims of $2,098 million declined 7.7% year over year in the second quarter but remained above our model estimate of $2,037.3 million.

Total net earned premiums of $2,064 million dropped 11.6% year over year because of limited pay products attaining paid-up status and implementation of a reinsurance transaction earlier. The figure beat our estimate by 4.2%.Adjusted net investment income decreased 11.9% year over year to $637 million due to reduced variable investment income, increased hedge costs and asset transfers, but beat our estimate of $626.1 million.

Month to date, major stock indexes are in negative territory. However, U.S. stock markets have returned to the northward journey in the last week of August.The primary reason for this turnaround is the release of a series of weak economic data. These data indicate that the U.S. economy is cooling. Market participants believe that a slowing economy may compel the Fed to control monetary hardness and aggressive interest rate hikes.Weak Economic DataThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the U.S. GDP grew at 2.1% in second-quarter 2023, lower than the previous estimate of 2.4%. The consensus estimate was 2.4%.The latest Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey reported that there were 8.8 million jobs open at the end of July, a decrease from the 9.16 million job openings in June. July’s data was the lowest since March 2021. Job hiring in July was 5.78 million, the lowest total since January 2021. The ADP jobs data has shown U.S. private employers added 177,000 jobs in August, sharply lower than revised data of 371,000 for June. The consensus estimate was 200,000. However, investors are waiting for the government nonfarm payrolls data to be released on Sep 1.The Conference Board reported that U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for August fell sharply to 106.1, well below the consensus estimate of 116. July’s reading was also revised downward to 114 from 116 reported earlier.The Present Situation Index, which gauges consumers’ views on current market conditions, fell to 144.8 in August from 153 in July. The Expectations Index, which is a measure of consumers’ short-term (next six months) outlook on income, business, and labor market conditions, dropped to 80.2 in August from 88 in July. The Expectations Index has remained below 80 (the level indicates expectations of a recession within a year) since February 2022 excluding last December.A similar kind of survey, conducted by the University of Michigan, reported that the final reading of the U.S. Consumer Sentiment for the month of August came in at 69.5 compared with the preliminary reading of 71.2.

386,b4f2d3d2-6421-3bc4-968d-5c4e9c103a14,AWK,2023-09-01,5 Utility Stocks to Invest in for a Stable Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-utility-stocks-invest-stable-120600909.html,1693483560,STORY,"['PNM', 'CWCO', 'YORW', 'AWK', 'ATO']","[Volatility has reappeared on Wall Street in August. The first three weeks of this month witnessed a reversal of the impressive bull run in the last seven months. However, U.S. stock markets regained momentum in the last week of August.At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank to strengthen your portfolio. Out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) suffered the most in 2023 as market participants’ thrust shifted from defensive to growth/momentum stocks. Year to date, XLU is down 9.4%.However, markets may remain volatile in the near future. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Weak economic data will indicate that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy for one and half year has started giving fruitful results. On the other hand, this will also indicate a slowdown in economic activities. At present, investors are clueless regarding the outcome of the Fed’s September FOMC meeting.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. Such companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Story continuesAdditionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have good potential for the rest of 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

391,f7d0f237-6022-3d0b-96bf-2521752c7fbd,PEP,2023-09-01,5 Safe Stocks to Buy Amid Declining Consumer Confidence,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-safe-stocks-buy-amid-122700199.html,1693484820,STORY,"['ETR', 'FE', 'PEP', 'JJSF', 'ATO']","[Job openings are shrinking, and the confidence level of Americans has taken a hit. Also, the second-quarter GDP grew slower than it was earlier estimated. Understandably, fears about the economy’s health and an impending recession have once again escalated over the past month.Americans, who were a lot more confident in July, are suddenly worried. Given this situation, investing in defensive stocks that assure steady returns seems prudent.Q2 GDP Growth Revised, Job Openings NarrowOn Aug 30, The ADP (ADP) National Employment report showed that private payrolls increased by just 177,000 in August, a lot lower than the upwardly revised reported 371,000 in July. This also missed the consensus estimate of 195,000.This follows the JOLTS report released on Aug 29, which showed that job openings declined to 8.8 million in July, lower than the consensus estimate of 9.5 million. Also, only 3.5 million workers quit their jobs in July, the lowest level in nearly two-and-a-half years.Clearly, the labor market is cooling. Lower job openings mean lower chances of people getting jobs. At the same time, fewer workers quitting their jobs decreases the chance of higher wages, which means lower personal income.In fact, the ADP report mentioned that job stayers saw a pay rise of 5.9% year over year in August, the slowest growth since October 2021.This came as the U.S. second-quarter GDP growth was revised down to 2.1% at an annualized rate from the earlier reported 2.4%.Consumer Confidence Takes a HitA slowing economy and sky-high inflation have been denting investors’ confidence. The confidence level reflected in Americans in July took a hit in August and declined to 106.1 from July's revised reading of 114, the Conference Board said on Aug 29. Analysts had expected it to touch 116.Moreover, a drop in consumers' assessment of future business scenarios is a distinct indicator that people are experiencing a sense of helplessness concerning an imminent economic downturn.Story continuesIn August, consumers' evaluation of current economic conditions saw a significant decline, plummeting to 114.8 from the previous month's reading of 153. Moreover, their outlook on economic conditions for the upcoming six-month period also deteriorated, dropping to 80.2 this month compared to 88 in July.Although inflation has more than halved over the past 12 months, it still remains elevated and a lot higher than the Fed’s target range of 2%. This has made Fed officials maintain their hawkish stance, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating more interest rate hikes.This is likely to further dent consumer confidence given that borrowing costs are already high after the central bank raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors such as consumer staples, and utilities. Also, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1).

392,c949da94-015c-3e94-a491-5fb9bebbddd6,REGN,2023-09-01,Regeneron (REGN) Gains 13% in 1 Month on FDA Nod For Eylea HD,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-regn-gains-13-1-174300973.html,1693503780,STORY,['REGN'],"[It has been an eventful month for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN, which managed to reverse its trajectory in the year so far with the recent FDA approval of a higher dose of aflibercept.Shares of the company have gained 13% in one month compared with the industry’s growth of 1.6%.Earlier in the month, the FDA finally approved aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) under the brand name Eylea HD.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe recommended dose for the drug is 8 mg every 4 weeks for the first 3 months across all indications, followed by 8 mg every 8 to 16 weeks (2 to 4 months) in wAMD and DME and every 8 to 12 weeks (2 to 3 months) for DR. The approval was based on the 48-week results of two studies, PULSAR and PHOTON. These two double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials compared Eylea HD to aflibercept injection at 2 mg. We note that a 2 mg dose of aflibercept is already approved under the brand name Eylea for various ophthalmology indications.The FDA earlier issued a complete response letter to the company’s biologics license application seeking approval for the 8 mg dose of aflibercept for these indications, which disappointed investors.The approval of Eylea HD will somewhat relieve investors, as Eylea had been a consistent performer for Regeneron, but sales in the last few quarters have been under pressure due to increasing competition from Roche’s RHHBY Vabysmo for wAMD and DME. Moreover, impending competition from biosimilars looms large over the drug.The uptake of Roche’s Vabysmo has been outstanding. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A. The European Commission also approved Vabysmo for these indications.Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY. Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Story continuesConcurrently, the FDA approved pozelimab-bbfg for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with CHAPLE disease, also known as CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy. The candidate has been approved under the brand name Veopoz.Per Regeneron, Veopoz is the first and only treatment indicated specifically for CHAPLE, an ultra-rare hereditary disease that can cause potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and ConsensusRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

DBTX for $213 million to expand its gene therapy programs for hearing loss.Decibel’s lead investigational gene therapy, DB-OTO, is in a phase I/II study.The pipeline progress has been encouraging as well. The European Medicines Agency recently accepted the marketing authorization application (MAA) for its pipeline candidate, odronextamab.The MAA is seeking approval for the candidate to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies.Regeneron is looking to solidify its presence in the lucrative oncology space.Its portfolio already includes an approved PD-1 inhibitor, Libtayo, which is approved to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation. The company is also evaluating multiple CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies, including PSMAxCD28, EGFRxCD28, MUC16xCD28 and CD22xCD28, in ongoing phase I studies in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo or in combination with corresponding CD3 bispecific.The successful development of additional drugs will diversify its product base.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Amid a drop in rail traffic, Union Pacific has furloughed at least 94 employees, including 43 machinists in 11 locations, according to an official with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).Josh Hartford, special assistant to the international president of IAM, said employees were told that the furloughs were happening because of plans to store 200 locomotives now and potentially an additional 100 within the next few weeks or months.UP confirmed that furloughs were occurring in response to lower volumes overall, but did not confirm the storing of locomotives nor the number of workers furloughed.IAM members are affected by the storing of locomotives because that translates into fewer locomotives for mechanics to maintain.Members were notified of the furloughs around Aug. 23, according to Hartford, with many of the furloughs occurring at outlier points with smaller repair shops than the bigger shops in Kansas City, Missouri, or North Platte, Nebraska.“It’s always concerning when they [furlough], but especially at this time of year, there should be an increase in demand. Grain season, harvest season coming on, the holidays coming up — they should be seeing increased traffic. To be parking locomotives now is really concerning,” Hartford said.“There’s no indication that this is a short-term furlough,” he added.Other unions whose members could be affected by furloughs include the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers (NCFO) and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Mechanical Division (SMART-MD), according to Hartford.An unconfirmed number of furloughs occurred among SMART-MD members, according to SMART spokesman Ben Nagy. IBEW and NCFO didn’t return requests for comment.The railroad said it has reached out to individuals affected by the furloughs.“As a routine part of business, we constantly examine our resources against volume needs,” UP told FreightWaves. “While some targeted furloughs are occurring in a handful of mechanical shops and an intermodal terminal, we are also hiring train crew professionals in several locations impacted by attrition and tight labor markets. Our Recruiting team has connected with every individual impacted by furloughs to consider pursuing other openings. The furloughs represent about 0.3% of all craft employees and 2% of mechanical craft employees.”Story continuesCarloads in 2023 have been trending lower than in 2021 and 2022 since May of this year. (FreightWaves SONAR) To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, click here.A comparison between grain carloads of the Class I railroads overall and Union Pacific’s grain volumes. (FreightWaves SONAR)Amid the furloughs, Hartford urged lawmakers to pass the Railroad Employee Equity and Fairness (REEF) Act, which he said has bipartisan support in the House and Senate. The bill also has stakeholder support from the unions as well as from the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.The bill would remove the sequestration constraints on the unemployment insurance program for railroad employees, according to an April release. AAR defines the bill as permanently removing railroad unemployment insurance and sickness insurance benefits from the impacts of budget sequestration, “the only unemployment program to have these impacts.”A temporary version of the REEF Act was included in the December 2020 COVID-19 relief bill, but those provisions expired on May 10 of this year.“We need this passed now, because now we have furloughed members using the unemployment benefit at a reduced rate,” Hartford said.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Falling grain exports will affect US railroads’ capacity needs, expert saysNew labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millionsAll eyes on Vena as he takes helm at Union PacificThe post Lower volumes prompt furloughs at Union Pacific appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Rajiv?Story continuesRajiv RamaswamiThank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a good fourth quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance, capping off a strong fiscal 2023. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our fourth quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter. And we continue to see steady demand for our solutions in Q4. This is driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter. We were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered strong ACV billings growth and record quarterly revenue of $494 million, a nearly $2 billion annualized run rate. We also had another quarter of good free cash flow generation despite some expected onetime payments. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2023 results demonstrate the progress we've made with our subscription model. Specifically, we delivered healthy year-over-year ACV billings growth of 27%, led by outperformance of our renewals business. We also delivered our first year of non-GAAP profitability in the company's history with a non-GAAP operating margin of 9%. Finally, despite the impact of several onetime payments, we generated free cash flow in excess of $200 million, a roughly tenfold increase compared to our prior fiscal year. Beyond the financials, we made significant progress across all aspects of our business in fiscal 2023. On the product front, we delivered general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure, announced meaningful new products in areas such as Kubernetes, data services and cloud management and defined our data services vision with Project Beacon to enable companies to build portable applications. We also enhanced our corporate governance profile through amendments to our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Finally, on the go-to-market front, we closed multiple large deals with major enterprise and government customers. These wins demonstrate the strategic relevance of our platform to our customers' key transformation initiatives and the success of our focus on landing these larger, more strategic transactions. Overall, for fiscal 2023, we demonstrated consistent execution, solid top line growth, strong renewables performance, sharp improvements in profitability and free cash flow and continued progress on our longer-term strategic priorities. Moving on, gaining sales leverage by our partners has been a priority since I joined as CEO. We said that we would focus on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact in how we go to market as well as provide more opportunities within larger accounts. This week, we made a milestone announcement on this front with a global strategic partnership with Cisco. This partnership is about combining the best of breed between our 2 companies. Cisco will combine the Nutanix cloud platform, along with their UCS compute and cloud management, deeply integrated with their networking and security. It's a fully integrated solution with joint engineering and interoperability and expanded support that will be sold by Cisco. We are excited about working with Cisco on this partnership and having them sell our leading hybrid multi-cloud software, leveraging their extensive go-to-market reach. Now I'd like to talk about our customer wins this quarter, which demonstrate the success we've been having in landing large multimillion-dollar ACV deals. A good example is a significant expansion we won in Q4 with the U.K.'s Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP, the U.K.'s biggest public service department. This win demonstrated the value customers are seeing in the broader capabilities of our platform. DWP has already adopted our cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and Nutanix Unified Storage to run its business critical workloads and was looking for a way to extend its footprint into the public cloud. In Q4, DWP chose NC2 to enable the shift of workloads from the private cloud to the public cloud. In their words, ""Nutanix NC2 allows DWP to seamlessly extend our on-premise footprint into public cloud, while avoiding the cost traditionally associated with lift and ship migrations. Furthermore, NC2's cost effectiveness and ease of use enable us to maintain a layer of abstraction for our most critical workloads that avoid both platform and vendor lock-in"". We couldn't have said this better ourselves and are grateful for the opportunity to partner with DWP on their cloud journey. Another notable win in the quarter was as a service provider partner in the EMEA region that was implementing a nationwide electronic health record or EHR system for a government health ministry. This partner chose Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and our AHV hypervisor to host critical EHR applications across 20 strategically located sites. They also chose Nutanix Unified Storage for managing the data on GPU-based image servers associated with the project. We see this win as a testament to the value our customers see in adopting our full stack offering and the growing contribution we are seeing from our service provider partners. Now I'd like to talk about AI and what it means to Nutanix now and in the future. Today, we already have customers using our platform to deploy AI, often for inferencing on video or sensor data who are seeing the same agility, performance and TCO benefits from our platform as customers running other workloads. They're deploying us for use cases ranging from faster checkout and retail applications, ensuring compliance with safety protocols at construction sites, to quality assurance and manufacturing applications. However, we see an emerging opportunity in the surging demand for generative AI. To date, there has been a lot of investment in large language models or LLMs, running in the public cloud. However, as AI models become more compact and organizations become concerned with issues such as intellectual property leakage, compliance and privacy, we expect there will be more demand to fine tune and run models on premises and at the edge. We believe there's an opportunity to provide a turnkey solution for those looking to jumpstart these AI initiatives. That's why we recently launched GPT-in-a-Box. This is a full stack, software-defined AI-ready platform along with services to help our customers size and configure hardware and software to deploy a curated set of LLMs using the leading open source AI frameworks on our platform. It allows customers to easily deploy AI-ready infrastructure to fine-tune and run generative pre-trained transformers or GPTs, while maintaining control of their data and applications. While it's still early, we are pleased with the initial interest we've seen to date in GPT-in-a-Box. Moving on, I'd like to highlight the recent addition of Mark Templeton to our Board of Directors. Mark's previous tenure as a public company CEO, combined with the strong domain knowledge of both cloud and data center infrastructure software makes him an excellent fit for Nutanix. I look forward to working with him closely as we execute on our hybrid multi-cloud vision. Finally, on the back of our strong free cash flow performance in FY '23 and in conjunction with our earnings release, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $350 million share repurchase authorization. We see this repurchase program as a reflection of confidence in the company's long-term market opportunity and financial outlook and an important milestone in our subscription journey. In closing, we are encouraged with the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model, enable us to provide an initial outlook for fiscal '24 that calls for continued solid top line growth, improving profitability and solid free cash flow growth from a strong fiscal 2023 level. We look forward to providing an update on our strategic priorities and longer-term financial outlook at our Investor Day in September. And we remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?Rukmini SivaramanThank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q4 '23 results and fiscal year '23 results, followed by our outlook for Q1 '24 and fiscal year '24. Q4 '23 was a good quarter in which we exceeded all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q4 was $279 million, higher than our guidance of $240 million to $250 million. Revenue in Q4 was $494 million, higher than our guidance of $470 million to $480 million. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.562 billion, a year-over-year growth of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. New logo additions were about 500 in Q4. Average contract duration in Q4 was 3 years, flat quarter-over-quarter as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 85.8%, higher than our expectations because of higher revenue than expected, certain nonrecurring savings and timing of hiring. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $361 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 13%, higher than our guidance of 9% to 10%. Non-GAAP net income was $68 million or EPS of $0.24 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 286 million shares. Billings linearity was good and DSOs were 29 days in Q4. Free cash flow in Q4 was $46 million, implying free cash flow margin of 9%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected billings and collections. We ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.437 billion, up from $1.358 billion in Q3 '23. Looking at our full year financial results, we exceeded all guided metrics for fiscal year '23 as well. ACV billings in fiscal year '23 were $957 million, higher than our guidance of $915 million to $925 million, and representing a year-over-year growth of 27%. A reminder that the annual ACV billings is slightly lower than the sum of the ACV billings from the 4 quarters due to adjustments for deals with duration of less than a year. Revenue in fiscal year '23 was $1.863 billion, higher than our guidance of $1.84 billion to $1.85 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 18%. A reminder that revenue in fiscal year '23 benefited from the normalization of orders with future start dates, resulting from our partner supply chain challenges. Largely because of this dynamic, fiscal year '23 revenue included the benefit of approximately $23 million in deferred license revenue that would have been recognized in late fiscal year '22 instead. We ended fiscal year '23 with an ARR of $1.562 billion, as mentioned earlier, a year-over-year growth of 30%. GRR or gross retention rate at the end of fiscal year '23 was 90-plus percent, and NRR, or net retention rate was 123%. Our fiscal year new and expansion ACV performance was impacted by some of the macro uncertainty we have previously discussed and performed slightly below our expectations entering the year and below what we believe its longer-term potential is. The renewals business continues to perform well, and it tends to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to our new and expansion business. Our relative economics and renewals have also continued to improve over time as the renewals team has improved their execution. Average contract duration in fiscal year '23 was 3 years, lower than the 3.2 years in fiscal year '22 as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal year '23 was 84.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal year '23 were $1.414 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year '23 was 9%, representing our first year of non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million, or EPS of $0.60 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 282 million shares. Free cash flow in fiscal year '23 was $207 million, implying free cash flow margin of 11%, representing a free cash flow margin expansion of 10 percentage points year-over-year. Overall, fiscal year '23 was a significant year, marking our first year with a positive non-GAAP operating margin at 9%, significant free cash flow generation of over $200 million while growing ARR at 30% and growing revenue at 18% year-over-year, all in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Moving on to Q1. The outlook for Q1 '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $260 million to $270 million, revenue of $495 million to $505 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%, non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 11%. The guidance for full year fiscal year '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.075 billion to $1.095 billion, exceeding the $1 billion threshold and representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint, revenue of $2.085 billion to $2.115 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 12%; and free cash flow of $280 million to $300 million. I will now provide some commentary regarding our fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of sales cycles. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewal business will continue to perform well. And while our available to renew or ATR pool continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year '24, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year '25 based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that the average contract duration would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year '23 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings. And regarding our bottom line guidance, we will continue to make targeted and prudent investments into our go-to-market and innovation engine to continue to invest in growth, while improving our profitability and free cash flow margin year-over-year. Overall, we remain confident in our view around a large and growing market for our solutions combined with a growing mix of renewals as a significant driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $350 million. We remain focused on investing in our business to support profitable growth and on delivering strong returns for our shareholders. This share repurchase program is consistent with these objectives and a reflection of the confidence we have in our long-term market opportunity and financial outlook. In closing, we are pleased that our fiscal year '23 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Pinjam Bora from JPMorgan.Pinjalim BoraCongrats on the quarter. Rajiv, I wanted to talk about AI. The GPT-in-a-Box, help us understand, is that largely kind of an integrated offering, kind of with a bundled pricing? Or is there any new functionality that you have developed. And it seems like it spans across hardware, software and services. How are you kind of thinking of going to market with it?Rajiv RamaswamiYes. So first of all, in terms of the platform, it's the same Nutanix cloud platform integrated with standard server platforms with NVIDIA GPUs as part of the solution, okay? And on top of that, what we add is a curated set of MLOps, software and LLMs, largely open source models, and we put that all together with the services offering that helps customers deploy this out of the box. Now what do they use it for? So what we see with generative AI is there's been a lot of focus about training these large LLM models in the public cloud. But when it comes to the actual usage of these, what you're going to see is companies need to run these AI models where their data is. And in a lot of applications, enterprise applications, sensitive data is stored on-prem or perhaps at edge locations where they're actually gathering the data in the first place. So with GPT-in-a-Box, they can run their AI applications, they deliver AI applications by fine-tuning these large LLM models that have been trained in the public cloud using what we call foundational models and public data. They can find tune this, make them more compact to run with their own data and use it on-prem. So that's the offering. Now in terms of go-to-market, we have a small tiger team that's very focused on working with our customers as we put use cases together. We're also building an ecosystem of ISVs and SI partners that can help us take this to market and expand our scale. So it's still early days, but I'm excited about where this is going.Pinjalim BoraYes, understood. And one for Rukmini. Rukmini, you talked about ATR slowing this year. Maybe help us understand why would that be the case? Is that just because that ACV was a little bit slower this year? Is that kind of adding up to it? And then are you baking in any upside from the VMware opportunity in events?Rukmini SivaramanSo on the first question on ATR. So we expect continued growth in our renewals ACV business in fiscal year '24 and our GRR continues to be good at 90-plus percent. But as you noted and as we said in our prepared remarks, we do expect that the renewals ACV will -- is expected to grow at a slower rate in fiscal '24 than in '23 due to the shifting of some renewals from '24 to '23, largely due to co-terming and some natural variation, right, that we see, the timing of renewals as customers choose to renew based on their budget cycles or other factors. In fiscal year '25, we expect renewals to go to reaccelerate based on our current view of our available to renew or ATR. And I think it's important to emphasize also that we continue to believe that this growing mix of renewals over time as a proportion of our total billings continues to be a driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. And I think your second question, Pinjalim, was around have we baked in any benefit from VMware spending acquisition by Broadcom, and so we continue to see significant engagement and opportunities related to potential concerns around that transaction. And in Q4, we did see a few of these opportunities close including a 7-figure ACV deal with the Fortune 100 company. So while it's difficult to predict the timing of these wins as we've talked about before, just because of some of the dynamics in the market, we do expect some benefit from these deals influenced by this transaction and have factored that into our guidance.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler.James Edward FishNice quarter, nice guide. (inaudible) to also see the new customers pick up again, understanding there's some seasonality here. But was anything causing that in particular in this environment to see the 500 net new customers, including anything on the competitive front to the last question and I appreciate the details on the net retention rate in the quarter here. But can you walk us through kind of how we should be thinking about net retention into next year, given kind of what's going on with retention rates? And does this mean with the cash flow guide being close to $300 million of this year that we could be thinking about well north of $300 million for fiscal '25? Or is that just an Analyst Day item that we should be patient for.Rajiv RamaswamiYes. I think there are 3 questions there, Jim. Maybe I'll take the first 2, which is around new logos and the competitive outlook, and then Rukmini can focus on the financial questions. So on the new logos, we continue to focus on these higher quality, higher ASP new logos. Most of them just new logo account. But seasonally, of course, Q4 is a strong quarter for us and weaker we - you saw the strengthened new logos there, relatively speaking. It's also we're focusing on larger, more strategic transactions, and we are seeing success on that front, certainly. So that's the new logo piece. From a competitive perspective, Rukmini already talked about the VMware dynamic there. Clearly, we've seen the engagement level grow there. Clearly, we've seen some deals starting to close. And there's still a lot of variability in terms of how the pendulum is going to swing on this one from customers who might just use us to get at a lower price from VMware to customers who truly see us about bringing a second vendor, and then reducing their risk with an alternative provider. So we'll have to see how that plays out. The hybrid cloud piece is really starting to work in terms of customers using more of us in the public cloud. So that piece of it is working well. Our partnership with the hyperscalers is actually coming through actually also nicely in that regard. So we feel good about our competitive positioning as we get into FY '24. Rukmini, you can perhaps address the NRR and other questions?Rukmini SivaramanYes. Yes. Jim, so on NRR, we were happy with the 1.3% that we reported for fiscal year '23. And in terms of fiscal year '24, Jim, what I say is I think you should still assume that part or sort of new and expansion business, the majority does come from expansion, like we talked about that before. We're not giving out a specific number today, Jim, but more color to come on that at our Investor Day. And similarly, on free cash flow, yes, we're happy to sort of guide to $280 million to $300 million for fiscal year '24. And again, more to comment at Investor Day. What I will say, though, is we continue to be focused on all the elements of that profitable growth piece, which means that we do intend to continue to evolve our -- grow our margins, free cash flow margins over time, while growing the top line, right? So that continues to be the intent, but I'll sort of hold on any specific free cash flow outlook beyond '24 for our Investor Day.James Edward FishFair enough. Just last one for me, Rajiv, on that Cisco partnership, I mean, how much demand were you getting for this? Just nice to have as Cisco UCS is a much smaller shareholder of that server market relative to some of your other partners and understanding Cisco has one of the best sales motions out there with this. But are there any minimums to think about? Or how should we expect the impact probably more for fiscal '25, but any impact for fiscal '24?Rajiv RamaswamiYes. So again, let me pass it out there. So Jim, first of all, yes, we have seen customer requests in the past for customers. There are many large customers with UCS deployments. They would like to see this joint solution from us and Cisco. So we're happy that we're able to announce that. Also importantly for us, the fact that Cisco has a go-to-market machine that's much bigger than ours. We today have about 20 -- call it about 25,000 customers roughly but our addressable market in terms of customers are at least 100,000. And so Cisco's broad market reach could help us get those initial entries. And again, we're going to work, co-sell with Cisco. Cisco is going to be the front in terms of selling this but we're going to be helping them along the way. And just I look at this as an expansion opportunity for us with a much larger customer base. Good for the customer in terms of them buying an integrated solution for everything they need in the data center, right? There's a virtual platform, cloud platform from us, the hardware from Cisco, both in terms of servers and storage as well as the networking features and the security aspects of this. So we are excited about this. Now in terms of the numbers, what we expect is we just literally announced it here. And we -- there's a whole process of training, enabling the feel et cetera. So we are factoring in a small amount in the later half of this year, like more likely in our Q4, but we certainly expect the momentum to build here over time.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.Meta A. MarshallGreat. Maybe just as a first question, understanding kind of the new customer cohort you guys have said is kind of a focus on higher quality and larger customers. Is there any way to quantify just in terms of what that cohort -- just in terms of kind of initial deal size or anything that kind of makes the point on that metric. And then just on kind of the re-acceleration and kind of general elongation of sales cycles right now, do you think that, that is kind of the catalyst for that reverting in fiscal '25 is purely macro? Do you need to kind of see more multi-cloud spending? Like what is it, just a matter of macro? Or what kind of do you think is the main catalyst for that re-acceleration?Rajiv RamaswamiLet me take a crack at the first part and Rukmini can add on. So our new ASP for these new logo ASPs are certainly up year-over-year for us given the focus. We haven't put a number on it, but perhaps one of the things we could do, take that as an action for our Investor Day to come back to you with looking at, for example, how many customers we have with over $1 million, for example of ARR. So we -- it's a good question, we will come back to you with more color. But in general, yes, new logo ASPs have been going up as a result of our focus. Rukmini, do you want to take the rest?Rukmini SivaramanSure. Yes. Meta, thanks for the question. So I think you had a couple of things in the -- woven into your question, Meta. So one was, I think, around just sort of sales cycles, right, which as we've talked about in the past, continues to -- we continue to see a modest elongation there, and that is really affecting only our sort of new and expansion business, right? And so that's sort of what we continue to see and some of those macro factors are factored into our '24 outlook in the new and expansion portion. Now -- and then you referenced I think the acceleration that we talked about in '24 as it relates to our renewals ACV growth rate. So just again, to reemphasize, the renewals ACV will continue to grow year-over-year for a while as we've talked about in the past. What we said was at '24, renewals ACV growth is at a slower pace than '23 because of the some timing variations between '23 and '24 due to some co-terming, but also largely due to just some timing as it relates to when customers choose to make their purchases because of their budget cycles and so on. And so we view that as effect in '24. But when we look at available to renew pool for '25, we see that re-acceleration in '25. So that's what we were referencing. And I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the new and expansion portion versus the renewals. Meta,. I hope that answers your question.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham.Michael Joseph CikosI did want to come back to the ACV billing for a second. And I know that -- congrats on the outperformance on the guidance. I believe you guys have cited outperformance stemming from specifically renewals when I think about the ACV billings. What drove that outperformance? Can you put some finer parameters around it, whether it be -- it sounds like macro was relatively stable, but -- was it just better execution, potentially conservatism for the guide? Like how do we view the different pieces that contributed to the outperformance you guys were able to generate?Rukmini SivaramanMike, thanks for the question. So there were maybe a couple of components that I'll talk to, and I welcome Rajiv to add anything else that he would like. So the first one is that around renewals, right, what we say when we mean renewals outperformed is that we see some (inaudible) earnings, as we've talked about before, which is sometimes more difficult to forecast. And we're also seeing continued improving discipline around renewals economics, which is what we transact renewals as compared to sort of what the original transaction was, right? So those are the ones that are contributing to improvement in renewals outperformance. And so that was a big driver, I would say, Mike, the outperformance in ACV billings. So that was really the largest driver of our performance for Q4 ACV billings.Michael Joseph CikosGreat. And I guess a 2 parter on a follow-up. One kind of (inaudible) up the ACV billings again. But if I think about the guidance that we have today for Q1 ACV billings, it's actually down sequentially. And if I look over the most recent 2 years, you've gone up from Q4 to Q1. Can you help us think about why it would be down sequentially. Maybe part of it has to do with this co-terming effect or maybe some of those deals that came in, in Q4 from let's say, the VMware deal that we cited earlier, that can you guys -- that's the first question, as far as the ACV guide being down in Q1 sequentially. The second is gross margins, I know we cited a benefit from nonrecurring savings and the timing of hiring. Can you help us unpack what -- or quantify what the nonrecurring savings were or what that dollar figure was and then the timing of hiring, I guess, we should expect for you guys to hire into that in the out year? Or is this -- this is hiring that's been -- you guys can actually prove more efficient versus what you had initially anticipated?Rukmini SivaramanOkay, Mike. Let me take that one by one. So on the Q4 to Q1, our typical seasonality is actually Q1 being lower in Q4, Mike, typically, because Q4 is a seasonally high quarter for us given it's the year-end, right? And it's sort of -- sellers are motivated, right, to go and have a good Q4. Last year was a bit of an anomaly, right? Because if you recall in Q4 '22, we saw some of this impact from supply chain disruptions that are affecting our partners and therefore, are also impacting us to some degree, right? So the Q4 '22 number was actually probably artificially lower, which led to a sequential increase last year. This is more normal, is how I would characterize that, Mike. And then to your question on gross margin, so we said a few things there. So one was revenue higher than expected. I think that's straightforward. And your question was on the other 2. So what we say when we mean timing of hiring is as sort of attrition happens, normal levels of attrition but sometimes it takes time to backfill and so on, so that can sometimes cross quarter boundaries. And so we saw some of that in Q4. Those people we would expect to be hired and backfilled in short order here, right, really probably in Q1. And the nonrecurring savings were not huge amounts, Mike. But just remember that I think Q4 also is a high gross margin here as well because COGS and operating expenses don't fluctuate as much over the year, but Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher top line quarters for us, right? So you'll see that those margins tick up higher in Q2 and Q4 and take a little bit lower in Q1 and Q3, which is why if you look at our overall fiscal year '24 guide, we're saying gross margin is approximately in that 84% range.OperatorAnd our next question comes from [George Wang] from Barclays.Unidentified AnalystCongrats on the quarter. I just want to ask about any update on the repatriation trends, especially given (inaudible), are you guys seeing sort of increased repatriation to on-prem, which may benefit Nutanix?Rajiv RamaswamiYes. So George, I can't say that we've seen increased repatriation as well. We've certainly seen instances of repatriation. What I would say is interesting is that we've also seen stuff in the other direction, which is people have committed to some of these large public cloud spend commitments. And what they're saying is they're not able to get their applications really to public cloud as quickly as they'd like to see and so they are now stuck with saying, I have to spend this much money in the public cloud because I committed to it already. And so we've seen that come to us because now they're looking at this saying, we are available through the marketplace of Azure and AWS. And we've seen people purchasing our software through the Azure and AWS marketplace, which help them retire some of their commitment in public spend. So yes, I think we see the world being hybrid, some work loads are being repatriated from the public cloud. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a wholesale trend. We see that in spots versus a systemic trend yet at this point. But the world is very much hybrid, people are being much more conscious about how much to put in the public cloud in the first place.Unidentified AnalystOkay. Great. Just a quick follow-up, if I can, we simplified portfolio kind of full platform approach. Can you talk about kind of the attach rate to Nutanix cloud platform cloud manager and kind of maybe high-level commentary on cross-sell and upsell?Rajiv RamaswamiYes. So I think that's 2 questions there. On the attach rate of the portfolio, for sure, the biggest change that we have seen since we launched our revised portfolio was much higher attach for cloud management along with our cloud infrastructure. In fact, that is the easiest attach sale, really, right? Everybody who built the cloud also wants to operate the cloud. So naturally attaching cloud operations, cloud management to our infrastructure. That's the best we've seen. We've also seen, of course, NC2, which is our public cloud extension is a natural extension, natural attach and it's really -- it ties together with our cloud platform very nicely. So that's another attach that is still relatively small for us, but growing every quarter in terms of customers, number of customers and customer accounts. Unified storage is the other element of the portfolio that we see reasonable attach with as well. The one that we have to actually really work with a specialist team to sell is our Nutanix database portfolio because that largely sold a level up in the stack to people who are either managing databases or at developers that requires more specialist skills, and that's much more of a specialist skill.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.Mehdi HosseiniYes, I want to go back to your fiscal year '24 guide. If I just take the midpoint, it seems like OpEx would need to grow by 7% and I understand your answer is coming, but would the collaboration or the deal with Cisco actually help? Is some of these OpEx growth assumptions built into the model? Or does that already bake into account? Or do you account for any cost savings as Cisco scales your product.Rukmini SivaramanSo let me first address the OpEx point, then we'll talk about any potential impact from Cisco. So if you look at our operating expense profile over the last several years, since about 3 years ago, it was about $1.5 billion and last year it was $1.4 billion, right? It's actually -- we've kind of really kept it sort of flat to down over the last 3 years, while, of course, continuing to grow ACV billings, the ARR revenue and so on since over that time. So we've been really sort of cautious about OpEx and then focusing on improved efficiency and productivity. Where we are now is that we are making some very prudent, I would say, and targeted investments in our go-to-market and in our innovation engine. As we talked about (inaudible) market, we believe is large and growing in order to go and capitalize on that. So we are making some targeted investments on that front. Now on the Cisco piece, I think what we expect the Cisco partnership for us to do is to continue to help sort of our productivity go up and really be additive to our overall top line, right? So that's how we should think about operating expenses relative to last year, but also relative to any potential impact for Cisco.Mehdi HosseiniOkay. And one follow-up for Rajiv. I just want to go back to your prepared remarks. And I'm just trying to better understand, I kind of agree with you that security, privacy, compliance would actually bode well for enterprises to scale AI. But as you think about the trained models moving from a cloud infrastructure into on-prem, would that actually require your existing or prospective customer with additional onetime CapEx investment or no?Rajiv RamaswamiYes. So that depends on what they've only -- I mean obviously, this AI requires compute resources, right? It requires several platforms with GPUs attached to it. So clearly, these are new workloads for the customer, they're going to have to buy new hardware, right, so -- and put our software on it. What they would do, just to clarify what they would do, the models likely are combinational models that are trained on publicly available data in the public cloud. But then when they bring it on-prem, they're going to fine tune this, and potentially make it more compact with their own specific data. A good example just to see how this works, maybe it's -- take support as an example, even us as a support, in terms of support, we have a lot of internal documentation that we don't put in the public cloud, internal design documents as well. So imagine using a generative AI back end to be able to go through all of that and quickly try and arrive at root cause or try and arrive at answers to customer support questions. So we want to run that on-prem or in a secure location where our data is stored. And so we will typically run that on, again, standard servers with GPU accelerators, [Ronin DJI] models with our stack.Mehdi HosseiniIs that where Cisco could come in and actually become a partner to facilitate that additional investment required?Rajiv RamaswamiI think the Cisco piece, by the way, just let me -- I think we should decouple that, right? Because this AI piece works with everybody's servers. So customers can buy servers from Dell or HP or Lenovo or any of server partners and we have a wide variety of them, and we have been supporting GPUs for multiple years. So we don't necessarily need this to be only Cisco. So they can buy that from where they like their server partners. What we expect with Cisco is a significant expansion in terms of our go-to-market reach, right, with their go-to-market, their ability to sell into a much broader customer base and their footprint, we should be able to benefit from that in the long term.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities.Erik Loren SuppigerCongrats on a good quarter. First off, on the GPT-in-the-Box, are those customers developing their own large language model or are they using third-party software on that box? And then secondly, in the -- go ahead.Rajiv RamaswamiYes, Erik, I think the answer that most of them would not build their own large language models. They would use foundational models that are available. For example, there's new ones coming out like LAMA2 that are open source. They could, of course, use GPT if they like as well. But there are much of the models. Most customers in the enterprise, I don't think will develop their own models, but use what's available out there. They would probably fine tune it with the data that they have.Erik Loren SuppigerOkay. That makes sense. And then secondly, in the partnership with Cisco, are the Cisco sales reps getting comped on selling the Nutanix software?Rajiv RamaswamiYes, they're getting comped just as if they were selling Cisco products. So 100% compensation for their service.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.Ruplu BhattacharyaIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I had one question for Rajiv and one for Rukmini. Rajiv, can you comment on a couple of things specifically demand by vertical. You talked about some share gains this quarter. How is the pricing environment? Is that holding steady? Or are you seeing any pricing pressure? And then can you talk about your view on the backlog heading into fiscal '24? Has that normalized now? Or is it still elevated?Rajiv RamaswamiYes. So on the pricing, we haven't seen any significant change in pricing this quarter compared to our last quarter. And in general, as we, for example, attach more of our products with our portfolio toward the ASPs tend to go up, right, because we're simply attaching more of the portfolio. So we haven't seen any shift or big change in our pricing dynamics. Now on the backlog and with respect to verticals, again, I can't say that there's any significant difference. I think it's more a function of volume and deal size that dictates discounts and rather than any particular vertical related factors for us. Now with respect to the backlog, I'm going to let Rukmini comment on that.Rukmini SivaramanYes. Thank you, Rajiv. So on backlog, as we talked about, I think, last year for fiscal year '23, backlog, it did move around as expected during the course of fiscal year '23. Despite that, we ended '23 actually a slight increase in asset backlog dollars year-over-year. And we are factoring that into the outlook for fiscal year '24. So we expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this year. But as is to be expected in an uncertain macro environment like the one we're in, I think the range of possible outcomes are just wider than before. And more generally, as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog could also continue to increase over time.Ruplu BhattacharyaOkay. If I can ask you, looking at the guidance for fiscal 1Q versus the full year fiscal '24, it looks like there's operating margin improvement as you go through the year. So what are the drivers for that? And then if you can talk about the seasonality you expect in ACV billings. Again, looking to -- should we think that going from 2Q to 3Q, should we expect the same level of decline, your renewables business is growing. So just any thoughts on how should we model ACV billings in fiscal '24?Rukmini SivaramanOkay. So there were a couple of questions there. I think the first one was on Q1 operating margin versus full year and so I think I'll just remind folks that, again, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally in general, seasonally a stronger quarter for us. Q2 because you have December in there, which is annual budget flush for many customers. And so Q2 is stronger for that reason and Q4 is our fiscal year-end. And so Q2 and Q4 seasonally strong quarters, which means that margins, although operating expenses and cost of goods sold don't vary as much, the top line does look stronger in Q2 and Q4, and therefore, margins in general also tend to look stronger in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q3, right? So that's sort of one call out on the margin piece on the full year versus 1Q. And then on seasonality, I think was your second question, Ruplu. More generally, I would just say, I think, as I said, you should expect some seasonality in top line for a slight decline between 2Q to 3Q and that follows sort of a new and expansion. Therefore, generally, renewals ATR also does follow that pattern as well. And to the extent we expect any variation in that, we'll make sure to call that out. But as of now, you should still expect somewhat fairly normal patterns with regard to that.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets.Nehal Sushil ChokshiAnd congrats on a strong quarter. You had another one. That's fantastic. And nice to see the buyback being announced. Could you talk about what is the priority of allocating capital to buyback relative to say, paying down debt?Rukmini SivaramanYes, sure. So I'll just talk very more generally. Our focus continues to be on sustainable possible growth, as we've said and we continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments into our go-to-market innovation engine, as I said earlier, the first answer to your question. We're happy to have generated over $200 million of cash -- of cash flow last year and have $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And so we think of this share repurchase authorization as a reflection of the confidence in our long-term financial outlook by returning capital to shareholders while ensuring that we have optionality to continue to invest in growth and to our other strategic priorities. And to your question on paying down debt, how we do take a look at that. Of course, we look at all of the alternative uses of our cash before making any decision. And our public converged, we pay 25 basis points on those, and they're not due for another few years. And so it made sense for us to think about that more holistically and sort of we believe that doing the share repurchase authorization is sort of the best use of our cash, given all of the other options available to us.Nehal Sushil ChokshiSo what's your anticipation of the pace of utilization of that buyback authorization then?Rukmini SivaramanWe have not given a specific time frame, Nehal, and authorization does not have an expiration date. And so the timing and amounts will depend on a variety of factors, as you can imagine, right, including just business conditions, stock prices and other factors. And so I'll leave that there.Nehal Sushil ChokshiWould it be fair to say that you want to return a certain percentage of free cash flow on a go-forward basis?Rukmini SivaramanWe are not giving out sort of a certain percentage at this point, Nehal. But we will just talk more generally about capital allocation and how we plan to use our cash at our Investor Day as well, right? So I'd be happy to sort of take more -- we talk more about that then.

Household consumption on an annualized basis tanked 15% in the second quarter.The barrage of bad economic reads sent the Hang Seng Index to an 8.5% decline in August, the worst performance since a 9.4% plunge in February.While the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has moved to cut interest rates to stabilize the economy, investors remain wary of putting money to work.""Investors are waiting for signs that Beijing, facing mounting downside pressures on growth, will adopt significantly more forceful and effective stimulus policies,"" 22V Research founder Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a client note. ""The latest signals are not very encouraging, suggesting continuation of a conservative approach despite the risks that it is insufficient to address China’s current challenges.""""There is little to suggest that Xi is abandoning his view that China must remain patient in the current recovery, avoid adopting measures that would worsen long-term debt risks, and focus on cultivating new growth drivers (such as clean tech) rather than propping up old growth drivers such as property,"" DeBusschere added.The sluggishness in China could present earnings risk to US multinationals headed into year-end.Here's what several top CEOs have told Yahoo Finance this month on the state of their businesses in China.People use an umbrella as they walk past a Lego store on a rainy day in Beijing on July 13, 2023. (WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images) (WANG ZHAO via Getty Images)Cummins CEO Jennifer RumseyFast fact: Cummins' main supply chain operations in China are situated in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Wuxi.""China has actually been quite slow for the last couple of years. So really at a level lower than we've seen in many years as a result of the very stringent COVID lockdown policy and the sluggish economy that we see in China. That market for us continues to be quite depressed. We're projecting some slow recovery, but really not seeing any dramatic signs of improvement in the market in China.""Story continuesLego Group CEO Niels B. ChristiansenFast fact: By the end of 2023, Lego will have 50% of its retail store base in China.""I'd say we haven't seen the acceleration out of the pandemic as fast as we had anticipated [in China]. So China came out of the pandemic later. And we had assumed that they would return to traffic in stores and consumer spending the way we've seen it in other countries. And I think we've been a bit disappointed that has happened quite a bit slower. So we're not exactly where we thought we would be at this point in China. I don't think it changes the fact that it is a big market with a lot of kids and an opportunity for our brands. We're keeping our investments going. We're building stores in China. But we have seen that [recovery] happen a bit slower.""Cisco CEO Chuck RobbinsFast fact: In its annual report, Cisco noted this as a key risk to its business in China: ""As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.""""We are very lightly exposed to China. It's less than 2% of our business. So it's not a significant part. But clearly, it seems to not be coming back online as fast as everyone expected them to. And I think that they'll continue to work the policy, they lowered their interest rates, which was interesting. And I know that the economic growth in China is one of the most important topics for the leadership there. So I expect they'll continue to make whatever moves they need to make.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.
