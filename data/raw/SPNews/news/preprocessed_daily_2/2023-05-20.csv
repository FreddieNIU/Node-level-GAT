So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics What Is Verisk Analytics's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Verisk Analytics had US$2.83b of debt in March 2023, down from US$3.63b, one year before. However, it does have US$235.3m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$2.60b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Verisk Analytics' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Verisk Analytics had liabilities of US$890.1m falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.22b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$235.3m and US$433.3m worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$3.44b.Of course, Verisk Analytics has a titanic market capitalization of US$31.9b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).With a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.1, Verisk Analytics uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 8.2 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. Verisk Analytics grew its EBIT by 4.8% in the last year. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Verisk Analytics's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Verisk Analytics recorded free cash flow worth 78% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewVerisk Analytics's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And we also thought its interest cover was a positive. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Verisk Analytics is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Verisk Analytics  that you should be aware of.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed list and jump directly to 5 Best Retirement Communities in Florida for Singles.Single Retirement PlanningAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 20 million adults aged 65 or older are single, while 27% of this population aged 60 and above live alone. With the baby boomer retirement wave looming, these numbers are only projected to worsen. Other baby boomers may find that they have become single unexpectedly, with divorces and the deaths of their spouses being the primary cause.U.S. News claims that about 31% of men and 55% of women are unmarried at age 65 and above. Since people spend an average of 18 years in retirement, it is crucial to study the impact of their marital status to determine how much they are saving up for their golden years. Singles also need to plan their retirement differently because they face a higher ratio of expenses to income, lose on spousal benefits of social security, and rely on a single income source, amongst real estate planning, taxes, etc.Regarding marital statuses and retirement, it is reported that less number of singles are saving compared to married individuals. In fact, a Ramsey Research Report claims that only 49% of singles save for retirement in comparison to 65% of couples. While more than half of married couples go on to save at least $25,000, only 30% of singles manage to save this much. Moreover, while only 18% of married couples have no retirement savings, about one-third of singles have zero savings for retirement.Singles are low on retirement savings because they have more bills to pay and no one to share them with. Business Insider notes that, on average, single Americans are paying a ""singles"" tax of approximately $7,000 annually. Obviously, couples who live together split the bills, and these savings add up throughout the years. Singles, on the other hand, bear the brunt of living alone. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 survey notes that average singles spend about $48,000 annually, with $17,800 spent on housing alone.Story continuesMeanwhile, married couples spend $76,000 annually and $12,405.5 each on housing, garnering savings of about $5,500. Other expenses such as food, groceries, and healthcare also add up more for singles. These costs may be over or under, depending on the area and size of the house.CNBC notes that retirement savings can start as early as the 20s. Therefore, it is best to start saving for retirement as soon as possible. Starting to save soon helps people save more and gives compound interest a longer horizon. Opening an Individual Retirement Account(IRA) with your employer can help you get on the track toward retirement savings. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) are some corporations that help individuals open IRAs.Companies like The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) offer different types of retirement accounts to help individuals meet their retirement goals. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) also delivers financial wellness to its employees and customers through different benefit plans and retirement options.All in all, Merill Edge, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR), Vanguard, WealthFront, and Fidelity Investments are some of the best brokers offering IRAs to customers. Merill Edge, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), helps individuals by providing them with guided and self-directed investment options.Flourishing in Retirement CommunitiesFlorida remains one of the top retirement destinations for seniors in their golden years.

Memory and other types of care add up to this amount.Singles can make the most from retirement communities in Florida as the sunshine state boasts more than 40% of the senior population as single.

6,09f56cea-7642-3a9d-bd16-43340596ab7f,NUE,2023-05-20,Is Trending Stock Nucor Corporation (NUE) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-nucor-corporation-nue-130001023.html,1684501201,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this steel company have returned -9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 8.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.25 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -45.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +36.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $16.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -41.9%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.46 indicates a change of -25.4% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.84 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -25.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $35.2 billion and $32.82 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and -6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor.

8,cc537fb8-f756-34ad-add8-6bdb9a84bede,AYI,2023-05-20,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Acuity Brands (AYI): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-look-bullish-133001586.html,1684503001,STORY,['AYI'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Acuity Brands (AYI).Acuity Brands currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by six brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the six recommendations that derive the current ABR, three are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for AYIBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for AYICheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Acuity Brands here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Acuity Brands, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is AYI a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Acuity Brands, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $13.88.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Acuity Brands. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Acuity Brands.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

9,18fbf0f6-417b-317c-a4ed-f75474c1af18,UNM,2023-05-20,Are Investors Undervaluing Unum Group (UNM) Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-unum-group-unm-134001036.html,1684503601,STORY,['UNM'],"[Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 6.36, while its industry has an average P/E of 10. Over the last 12 months, UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 5.47, with a median of 6.48.Investors should also note that UNM holds a PEG ratio of 0.70. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. UNM's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.66. Over the past 52 weeks, UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.54.We should also highlight that UNM has a P/B ratio of 0.98. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.65. Over the past 12 months, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 0.87.Story continuesValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.76. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.12.Finally, our model also underscores that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.62. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.68. UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.70 and as low as 4.71, with a median of 5.65, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Unum Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors Co. GM, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, Unum Group's UNM, MGM Resorts International MGM and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Value Stocks to Buy Amid Recession ThreatsWe are in the middle of a volatile May after a solid April. Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metrics raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained range-bound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.General Motors Co. has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM's strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.The forward P/E of General Motors for the current financial year is 4.61X, lower than the industry average of 9.84X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.47, lower than the industry average of 1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last seven days. United Airlines Holdings Inc. is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. Our second-quarter total revenue estimate indicates a 14.7% year-over-year increase.For second-quarter 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve almost 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. UAL's focus on cargo revenues is encouraging. UAL's fleet-upgrade efforts are commendable as well.The forward P/E of United Airlines for the current financial year is 4.16X, lower than the industry average of 9.74X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.09, lower than the industry average of 0.28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last 30 days. Unum Group's conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. Sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience. The geographic expansion of UNM is paying off as acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K.We believe strong operating results have led to a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, boosting financial flexibility. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders' value. For the long term, it estimates premiums from core business to increase 3-5%. UNM estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.The forward P/E of Unum for the current financial year is 8.67X, lower than the industry average of 11.75X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.81, lower than the industry average of 1.49. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last seven days. MGM Resorts International is benefiting from increased business volume and travel activity, primarily at MGM China and Las Vegas Strip Resorts. The removal of COVID-related travel restrictions in Macau resulted in high contributions from the MGM China segment.MGM Resorts is also planning to expand its footprint in New York. MGM is optimistic regarding BetMGM operations as it anticipates revenue contributions of $1.8 -$2 billion in 2023.The forward P/E of MGM Resorts for the current financial year is 6.77X, lower than the industry average of 20.71X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.39, lower than the industry average of 2.12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. is likely to gain from expansions in the Permian Basin. The Sandbox and EP Minerals buyouts are also expected to make significant contributions. SLCA's focus on increasing its footprint and product offerings in specialty end markets is also likely to boost margins.The forward P/E of SLCA for the current financial year is 8.36X, lower than the industry average of 9.46X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.60, lower than the industry average of 2.17.

MHO, UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. PK and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. GPI.Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks with Exciting EV-to-EBITDA RatiosPrice-to-earnings (P/E), given its inherent simplicity, is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world. It is preferred by many investors while handpicking stocks trading at a bargain. However, even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric has a few downsides.While P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm's equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Unum Group, M/I Homes, Inc., UFP Industries, Inc., Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. are some stocks with impressive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?Also referred to as enterprise multiple, EV-to-EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In essence, it is the entire value of a company.EBITDA, the other element, gives a clearer picture of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dampen net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Typically, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued. Unlike the P/E ratio, EV-to-EBITDA takes debt on a company's balance sheet into account. For this reason, it is typically used to value acquisition targets. The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear. Stocks flaunting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesMoreover, P/E can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements.As such, a strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen bargain stocks.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that passed the screen:Unum Group provides long-term care insurance, life insurance, employer- and employee-paid group benefits and related services. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score of A.Unum Group has an expected year-over-year earnings growth rate of 14.8% for the current year.

The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), with shares yielding a solid 3% annual dividend.Shares currently trade at a 6.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple, just marginally above the five-year median and well below the Zacks Finance sector average.Further, the company's current forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio works out to be 0.7X, again well beneath the Zacks sector average.UNM carries a Style Score of ""A"" for Value.And to top it off, the company carries a respectable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 15% on 3% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, earnings and revenue are projected to witness growth of 5.3% and 3.3%, respectively.NXP SemiconductorsNXP Semiconductors, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a global semiconductor company providing high-performance mixed signal and standard product solutions used in various applications. Shares currently yield 2.4% annually, with the company's payout growing by an impressive 40% over the last five years.Story continuesNXPI's current 12.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple sits well beneath the 16.1X five-year median, with the value also reflecting a 47% discount relative to the Zacks Computer and Technology sector.The stock carries a Style Score of ""B"" for Value.Graphic Packaging Graphic Packaging is a leading provider of paperboard packaging solutions for various products. Analysts have raised their earnings estimates across the board, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).GPK's 8.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple is a fraction of the 12.9X five-year median and the Zacks Industrial Products sector average.In addition, the forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio presently sits at a small 0.8X, nearly in line with the five-year median and again nowhere near the Zacks sector average.Bottom LineValue investors are always looking for deals, expecting the rest of the crowd to eventually catch onto the discounts and lead to significant gains.And when you pair this strategy with the Zacks Rank, which is focused on earnings estimate revisions, it's much easier to find mispriced stocks with great near-term potential.All three stocks above – Unum Group, NXP Semiconductors and Graphic Packaging Holding Company – could be watchlist considerations.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metric raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained rangebound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A.

GM has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM’s hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM’s Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess.

Shares have lost about 11% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is State Street Corporation due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.State Street Misses on Q1 Earnings as Expenses RiseState Street’s first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.52 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. The bottom line was 4.4% lower than the prior-year level. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was $1.53 per share.Results have been primarily hurt by a rise in expenses, higher provisions and lower fee revenues. Lower asset balances also affected the results. However, an increase in net interest revenues (NIR) and growth in the net interest margin (NIM) supported the results to some extent.After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders was $525 million or $1.52 per share, down from $583 million or $1.57 per share in the year-ago quarter. We projected a net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) of $538.9 million.Revenues Improve Marginally, Expenses RiseTotal revenues were $3.10 billion, increasing marginally year over year. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.12 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $3.10 billion.NIR was $766 million, jumping 50.5% year over year. The rise was driven by higher rates and balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits. The net interest margin (NIM) rose 51 basis points year over year to 1.31%. Our estimates for NIR and NIM were $779.5 million and 1.29%, respectively.Total fee revenues decreased 9.2% to $2.34 billion. The fall was due to a decline in almost all fee income components, except for securities finance revenues and other fee revenues. We projected total fee revenues of $2.44 billion.Non-interest expenses were $2.37 billion, up 1.8% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in compensation and employee benefits costs, and other expenses. Our estimate for the metric was $2.39 billion.The provision for credit losses was $44 million in the reported quarter against NIL provisions in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $5.1 million.The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.1% as of Mar 31, 2023, compared with 11.9% in the corresponding period of 2022. The return on common equity was 9.3% compared with 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesAsset Balances DeclineAs of Mar 31, 2023, total assets under custody and administration were $37.6 trillion, down 9.8% year over year. The fall was due to lower equity and fixed-income market levels.Assets under management were $3.6 trillion, down 10% year over year, reflecting lower equity and fixed-income market levels, and net outflows.Share Repurchase UpdateIn the reported quarter, State Street repurchased shares worth $1.25 billion.Second-Quarter 2023 OutlookNIR is expected to decline 5-10% sequentially. This is likely to be due to the non-interest-bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as monetary tightening and interest rate hikes continue.Fee revenues are expected to be up 4-5% on a sequential basis, with servicing fees rising 1-2% and management fees to be flat to up 1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Further, software and processing fees are projected to increase substantially based on the number of on-premise renewals and SaaS conversions during the quarter.Management expects adjusted expenses to be flat on a sequential basis excluding $181 million of seasonal compensation cost incurred in the first quarter.Effective tax rate is expected to be 21%.2023 OutlookNIR is anticipated to increase in the range of 5-15%.The company expects to operate somewhat below its standard target ranges for the CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. It initially expected the CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios to be 10-11% and 5.25-5.75%, respectively.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.55% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, State Street Corporation has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise State Street Corporation has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(NASDAQ:QRVO) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Qorvo The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$702.3mUS$548.5mUS$841.8mUS$909.3mUS$1.08bUS$1.17bUS$1.24bUS$1.30bUS$1.35bUS$1.40bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.88%Est @ 4.75%Est @ 3.96%Est @ 3.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$635US$448US$622US$608US$653US$640US$613US$581US$546US$510(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.9bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$6.1bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$12b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$95.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Qorvo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.427. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QorvoStrengthDebt is well covered by cash flow.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

But long-term investors don’t need to worry too much about market timing. Plus, there are many great stocks with proven and resilient businesses that investors should feel comfortable buying now at rather attractive levels and holding for the long haul. The two stocks we dive into today are Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and Visa Inc. (V).Debt-ceiling talks have taken over Wall Street in recent days even as Walmart, Target, and other huge names round out the first quarter earnings season. President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy finally started to talk positively about a deal mid-week to help send stocks climbing. Stocks then dipped on Friday on reports that talks are stalling again.Thankfully, a debt-ceiling deal is almost certain to get done despite all of the worrisome partisan discourse and back and forth because defaulting could be catastrophic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe market is also telling investors not to worry too much, with the S&amp;P 500 currently up 9% in 2023 and the Nasdaq about 21% higher. Both indexes also still trade well off their record highs, which leaves room for plenty of potential near-term upside if earnings outlooks hold steady in the coming months and inflation continues to cool.Better yet, there are tons of great, proven large-cap stocks trading at potentially attractive levels right now that long-term investors should feel comfortable buying and holding even if the market hits a few roadblocks later this year.Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is a diversified global leader in medical and lab equipment, specialty diagnostics tools, reagents and consumables, and much more. TMO’s offerings serve the broader biotech, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sector, operating under units such as Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, and beyond.Story continuesThermo Fisher benefitted immensely from Covid-19 testing. But TMO’s sales and earnings were surging long before the pandemic and its near-term outlook for FY23 and FY24 showcases top and bottom line expansion even as it faces a very difficult to compete against stretch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThermo Fisher, which lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, topped our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates in late April. The $200 billion market cap titan is currently trading around 20% below its highs and its average Zacks price target. And 12 of the 16 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for TMO stock are “Strong Buys.”TMO shares are still up 55% in the last three years and 500% in the last decades vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 160% and its Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s 190%. Plus, TMO is trading around 30% below its 10-year highs at 21.1X forward earnings and at an even larger discount vs. its industry despite its big outperformance. And TMO raised its dividend by 17% earlier this year.Visa Inc. (V) is a credit card giant that remains hugely influential in the U.S. and around the world despite all of the ‘disruptions’ from fintech. Visa operates an extensive and powerful payment and processing network and it takes a piece of the endless number of credit card payments in a world that is growing more cashless by the day.Visa beat our quarterly earnings estimates in late April on the back of rising payment volume. The company is also benefitting from surging international travel alongside rival Mastercard. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa’s FY23 and FY24 consensus earnings estimates have popped slightly since its release and it lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. Zacks estimates call for Visa to post 14% adjusted earnings growth this year and 13% higher earnings next year, driven by roughly 11% sales growth both this year and next.Visa stock has unperformed the market over the last three years, up 20% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 40%. But it could be poised to break out with it back above both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. On top of that, Visa has more than doubled the benchmark over the last 10 years, up 415%. And Visa is trading slightly below its 10-year median and at a roughly 35% discount to its own highs at 25.2X forward earnings. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition to causing high blood pressure, it can cause organs, like the kidneys and liver, to not work normally.The rate of first-time hypertensive disorders in pregnancy nearly doubled from 2007 to 2019, Wall Street Journal noted. Rising rates of obesity and hypertension before pregnancy are likely drivers, doctors, and researchers said.Thermo Fisher's test is meant for mothers with high blood pressure or mild preeclampsia admitted to a hospital for observation, is already available in Europe and could soon be available in the U.S.Testing of the blood-based biomarkers was looked at in over 700 women.In a study of the test submitted to the FDA, women whose ratio of proteins fell below the threshold had less than a 5% chance of developing severe preeclampsia within two weeks.

Preeclampsia is the leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide, with incident rates that have increased rapidly in the United States over the last decade.These new assays are designed to be used along with other laboratory tests and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of pregnant women who have been hospitalized for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to determine if they are at risk of progressing to preeclampsia with severe features within the next two weeks.""Thermo Fisher is committed to advancing diagnostic solutions for reproductive health as part of our broader Mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer,"" said Alan Sachs, chief medical officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific. ""Today’s clearance of these breakthrough biomarkers will have a significant impact on prognosis and treatment for thousands of women at risk for preeclampsia every year in the U.S.""Testing of the blood-based biomarkers, B·R·A·H·M·S sFlt-1 KRYPTOR and B·R·A·H·M·S PlGF plus KRYPTOR, aids in the detection of the development of severe preeclampsia as validated by the PRAECIS study, which examined 18 U.S. hospitals, looking at more than 700 pregnant women across the country1. Women who test positive, based on the risk stratification ratio of the two assays (sFlt-1/PlGF ratio ≥ 40), could receive enhanced surveillance and accelerated care before severe features develop.Story continues""FDA clearance and availability of these novel biomarker tests throughout the country will allow caregivers to better manage and potentially improve outcomes for both mothers and their newborns,"" said Ravi Thadhani, MD, MPH, executive vice president of health affairs at Emory University and co-author of the PRAECIS study.""Patients and providers will benefit from having better tests to predict progression to preeclampsia with severe features, especially for those patients at risk of severe, early-onset disease or for whom there is some diagnostic uncertainty,"" said Eleni Tsigas, chief executive officer at the Preeclampsia Foundation. ""Our organization celebrates this result after many years of advocacy with leaders in research and regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, to accelerate the development and adoption of better clinical tools.""These new assays are designed to run on the Thermo Scientific B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS clinical chemistry analyzer.

(NYSE:TMO) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is 141% higher today. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Thermo Fisher Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 19% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Thermo Fisher Scientific the TSR over the last 5 years was 144%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThermo Fisher Scientific shareholders are down 3.6% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 5.8%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 20%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Thermo Fisher Scientific .Of course Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

For 81 years, 30 of those under the ownership of Eddie Davis, Bass Furniture's Michigan Ave. location has stood the test of time.""There's been a lot of stores that have gone out of business, but Bass Furniture is still there,"" said Davis, who bought Bass Furniture from Gil Levy, the original owner's son-in-law, in the 1990s. ""I don't profess to be such a smart businessperson. I do what I do and thank God that I'm allowed to do it.""Davis, who worked at the store for years before taking steps to buy the store, faced difficulties with financial institutions to secure financing to buy the business. For instance, one bank okayed financing over the phone but declined in person. Davis was eventually financed by Levy himself, who later sent Davis a note saying the $125,000 he owed was paid in full.It was around this time that he first met Katrina Barber, a young teller working at Pullman Bank. Pullman Bank was later acquired by U.S. Bank, where Barber is now a branch manager. For 32 years, she's been there for Davis and his family as they've opened up accounts ranging from personal checking to mortgages and loans.""I first worked with Mr. Davis as a teller when he was making his deposit,"" said Barber. ""I then moved over to the business side of banking and learned more and more about his business. Our relationship was fostered throughout the years around the trust and belief that we were going to take care of him and his business.""Story continuesIt's that trust that anchors Barber, the Pullman Branch team and U.S. Bank to the community. Since 2009, U.S. Bank has invested more than $100 million in the Pullman community. Among that support is the U.S. Bank Pullman Community Center, which opened in 2018. Chicago is also home to one of the bank's new Business Access Advisors (BAA). Serving as a trusted resource, BAAs aim to expand networking and business development opportunities for Black business owners as well as provide business and consumer products that help strengthen both the financial profile of the business and its owner.""Historically and in this moment, minority-owned businesses face hurdles with access to capital, connections and information,"" said Micae Brown, Chicago's BAA, who visited Bass Furniture with business bankers during a city-wide tour of Black-owned businesses. ""However, at U.S. Bank, myself, the BAAs, business bankers and others are working with business owners and the community to assist in addressing gaps that make it difficult to grow their business.""For Davis, it all comes back to community and the knowledge he won't ever walk alone.""Before the pandemic, we would have this annual fundraiser for the Roseland Business Development Council, which Bass Furniture is a member of,"" said Davis. ""The bank would support us in our efforts. That's why, whenever Katrina is doing something, we're there. No man is an island. You can't do things by yourself.""To see the recent #usbankroadtrip visit to the Pullman branch featuring Barber and Davis, watch the video above.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/756054/Through-Community-and-Trust-Bass-Furniture-and-US-Bank-Invest-in-Chicago]"

That decision followed a weekend-long bidding war overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.“How do you explain approving a sale to a banking giant that increases the risk to the banking system by somewhere between nearly 800% and 1400% more than selling to other bidders?” Warren said.The percentages Warren cited were a reference to an institution's Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) score, which estimates the impact a bank would have on the US economy if it were to fail.According to these scores, Warren said, JPMorgan posed 8 times more risk than PNC (PNC) and 14 times more than Citizens Financial Group (CFG), which were also among the bidders for First Republic.Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she is ""very troubled"" by the First Republic sale to JPMorgan. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, she added, is required to consider concentration of power when assessing whether an acquisition might pose risks to stability of the US banking system.""According to your own metric you chose the one that gives us more concentration in the system,"" Warren said. ""I am very troubled by that decision.""Hsu said there were other factors regulators had to consider while evaluating bids for First Republic, which was previously the nation's 14th largest bank.The government had to act quickly to find a buyer over one critical weekend, and it had to minimize losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which is used to cover losses associated with bank failures. The seizure of First Republic is estimated to cost the FDIC $13 billion.Story continues“Had we followed a strict GSIB score methodology to the exclusion of everything else, I fear that there would have been greater financial instability that weekend,” Hsu said.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has forcefully rejected any concerns about the nation’s biggest bank getting even bigger as a result of this deal.""We need large successful banks in the largest and most prosperous economy in the world,"" he said the day the First Republic deal was announced. ""For anyone who thinks that the United States of America should not have that should call me directly.""JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has rejected suggestions that the First Republic deal concentrates too much power in his bank. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Warren raised her concentration concerns separately in a May 17 letter to Hsu and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg. In that letter she cited a $2.6 billion profit JPMorgan expects to book from the First Republic sale.""The net result of these machinations is that, without a complete regulatory review, and at a cost of $13 billion to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the nation’s biggest bank – already too big to fail – got a bargain deal on a failing bank that made it even bigger,"" Warren said in her letter.""What additional regulatory requirements will be placed on JPMorgan to ensure that the bank’s acquisition of First Republic does not increase systemic risks to the financial system or reduce competition?""Gruenberg, who also appeared before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, offered a number of new details about the fall of First Republic in his prepared testimony.The lender first ran into troubled following the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank, losing more than $100 billion in deposits in March. When it told investors about those outflows on April 24, a run on the bank began again. It lost another $10 billion between April 26 and April 28, Gruenberg said.Michael J. Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, faced questions about the First Republic sale to JPMorgan. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The outflows caused the FDIC to downgrade the bank to ""problem status"" on April 28, he said, which changed the bank's borrowing status with the Federal Reserve and made it even more difficult to meet its liquidity demands.The FDIC invited 21 banks and 21 nonbanks to participate in a bidding process, according to Gruenberg. That included JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), and PNC, according to people familiar with the matter. Citizens and US Bancorp (USB) were also reportedly invited.It received 12 bids from four bidders, Gruenberg said. The FDIC requested best and final offers from the four bidders by 7 pm ET on April 30. The sale to JPMorgan was announced in the early hours of May 1.Trying to beat JPMorgan in a bidding war is like “pitching against the Yankees,"" one banking executive told Yahoo Finance this week.

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Cintas'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cintas is:36% = US$1.3b ÷ US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.36 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Cintas' Earnings Growth And 36% ROETo begin with, Cintas has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Cintas was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.We then compared Cintas' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 8.7% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Cintas''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Cintas Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Cintas has a three-year median payout ratio of 33%, which implies that it retains the remaining 67% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, Cintas is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 34% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Cintas' future ROE will be 40% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Cintas' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

One of the big takeaways from this week, companies calling out the cautious consumer.MICHAEL FIDDELKE: Consumer spending patterns continue to evolve, putting significant pressure on our discretionary categories.DOUG MCMILLON: The stubborn inflation in dry grocery consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically general merchandise.MICHAEL HARTSHORN: The low-end customer continues to be pressured, whether it's the ongoing inflation, reduction in SNAP benefits, lower tax refunds.TED DECKER: The newer dynamic now that we're really seeing again just this past quarter is a more cautious consumer given the broader macro concerns, including credit availability.SEANA SMITH: Joining us now for more on this, we want to bring in Jerry Storch, Storch Advisors CEO, also former CEO of Toys R Us. We also have Aneesha Sherman, Bernstein senior analyst here to help us break down all of these reports. Jerry, first to you, just in terms of this cautious consumer message that we have gotten time and time again over the last five days, what does that signal just about some of the cracks that we're starting to see?- Well, it's not new. This is very predictable. The consumer actually started to slow last summer and it's been pretty much a straight line since then. For the last eight months now in a row, retail sales have been negative when adjusting for inflation when you look at it on a year over year basis. And that's how retailers think about, that's how the reports come out.Story continuesWhat's your comp sales? How did this year do compared to last year? And the answer is for the economy as a whole, it's been negative and getting worse for eight straight months. The consumers are increasingly stretched. And they're running out of money and they're leveraging up their credit cards.AKIKO FUJITA: And Aneesha, are we starting to see some of that bottom out or at least starting to see some of that improvement? And what do you make of the way that some of these retailers, especially the big box names that reported this week, have adjusted to that?- I think what we're seeing differently this year-- I agree that overall the sector has been pressured. But what we're seeing differently this year is last year the mainstream and premium consumer was doing great. I mean, if you look at the numbers of some of the mainstream and premium brands in the sector, they were growing double digit in North America. And they are now comping off some really tough numbers from last year and their consumer is starting to pull back.The low-income consumer has been under pressure for over a year now. And so I think what we're seeing differently than what we did a year ago is some trade down. So we've seen transactions at Walmart, at Target, at TJX, at Ross positive year over year, which suggests that there is some trade down coming into the value side of the equation as some of those mainstream consumers make different choices. And that's what some of the new data is showing that wasn't the case last year.So for value retail, I think it's a positive. I mean, they continue to see their low-income consumer being pressured. That's not changed. What they're seeing differently is some people opting into value that used to be buying more expensive items six, eight, nine months ago.SEANA SMITH: Jerry, that trade downtrend that Aneesha is talking about, is that trend here to stay? And aside from Walmart, who's best positioned for that?GERALD STORCH: Well, it's here for a while. Since 1961, both Target and Walmart were founded. In tougher times, Walmart does better. And in worse times, Target does-- I mean, I'm sorry. In good times, Target does better.These are definitely not good times. And you see that even though everyone talks about the consumer being pressured, Walmart's comp sales were 7.6% or something, very high comp sales. Target was flat. Walmart was way up on the internet. Target was negative on the internet.So Target's really just not made, sort of, to function in this kind of environment. Whereas, Walmart with the heavy emphasis on food, consumables, and value really, really is. So I think Walmart is absolutely positioned to do well here. And so all the value retailers really are as you just heard. I think that's true.I do think, though, there's a big gap between people like Target or Costco, you know who, on the one hand, Costco will do great in any environment, Target will not. Walmart and Ross, even though they're all value stores, you see Walmart with the food being able to do well. Consumable purchases like apparel are not going to do as well.So there's companies like Five Below that I think will look very strong throughout, value player, kind of, NeeDoh type of merchandise. So there'll be winners and losers. Not all boats rise. And just because you have value attached to your name doesn't mean you'll win either.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Aneesha, an interesting comment here from Jerry because he talks about the gap that we're seeing within the value names. But we've really seen a huge gap between value everyday purchases and then the luxury consumer, which has been largely resilient.We were talking about luxury watches yesterday still doing really well. How sustainable is that? And are we starting to see any cracks on that end?ANEESHA SHERMAN: For high luxury, no. That consumer is not subject to some of these pressures that we're talking about. Inflation, fuel costs, it's really not impacting a consumer that is buying high luxury.Now, in the mainstream side, which you're talking about slightly above mainstream premium, absolutely. They are the ones who are trading down. And even last quarter, we saw Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, all the department stores, many of the mainline brands talking about losing traffic. Because those consumers are the ones who are pulling back and they are now opting into value retail.So putting food aside, I mean, obviously, food spend is different and it's more inelastic. Discretionary spend, yes, the mainstream consumer is pulling back and making different choices than they were making a year ago. And that is benefiting some of the lower-end retailers, but it's not the high luxury consumer. That is still going strong and is unimpacted by some of these macro headwinds.SEANA SMITH: Aneesha, what about inventory levels? There has been such a focus on that leading up to this quarter. We saw some improvement from Target.Home Depot was flat. Walmart's also declined. Have retailers fix this problem? And how big of a boost do you potentially see that to margins?ANEESHA SHERMAN: We are way past the peak. Retailers have made a lot of progress. And we heard it even from them in Q4. We've heard it in our channel checks. They've offloaded a lot of inventory.Now where has it gone? It's gone to liquidators, jobbers. A lot of it was sold into off price where they're holding it and pack away to sell through to the consumer later. So it's not out of the system yet, but many of them, the leading brands and retailers, have cleared it off their balance sheets.We're past the peak, they're still clearing. But we're past the peak of it and they're ordering much lower. So the net effect is going to be declining over the course of this year.That said, it's still in the system. So it's not coming out of the system, I think, at least until another three or four quarters depending on how strong demand is. Because that's the other side of it, they can't sell it through if there isn't demand. So if demand continues at the trend it's at, now I think Q1 '24 is the first we'll see where the system is clean. If demand continues to decelerate, it could even be further along.AKIKO FUJITA: Jerry, when you put together economic data that we've gotten so far on the consumer, you mesh that with what we heard from executives on these earnings calls this week. Who do you think is best positioned right now? Who's operating from a place of strength when you look at the retail landscape?GERALD STORCH: Well, I think we've been through it. There's not much doubt that Walmart is in a very strong place. And keep in mind, it's not just that they know how to operate in these times, it's that they really are heavily focused on food and consumables. And that people have to buy and do and they trade into Walmart in tough times.And Walmart is the nation's largest grocer and they're gaining share. And so they are exceptionally well positioned. I think Amazon is another company that it's very complex to analyze because of the cloud business, and the retail business, and all the pieces that are flying around there. But you notice the internet is back growing again faster than bricks and mortar. And Amazon, in many ways, still is the internet.We saw a great performance in the internet by Walmart, a very poor performance by Target. And so meanwhile, you know, I'm not embarrassed to admit I order something from Amazon almost every day of the week. And I think most of us do really look at it. So I think they're in a very strong place as well. And so many of the trends that we saw pre-pandemic are reasserting themselves with a heavy value focus at this time.AKIKO FUJITA: You are certainly not alone in your Amazon orders there, Jerry. Jerry Storch and Aneesha Sherman, good to talk to both of you today. Have a good weekend.]"
35,95a61afa-8cec-3010-b35e-203ad291cc90,WMT,2023-05-20,Dissecting Retail Earnings and Shifting Consumer Spending Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dissecting-retail-earnings-shifting-consumer-184106417.html,1684521666,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'WMT', 'TGT', 'AMZN', 'FL']","[It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and uncertainty about the economy has forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart WMT report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores and digital offerings in response to the aforementioned headwinds. The expected continuation of this same trend is also at the root of management’s upgraded guidance for the year.Another trend at play is the shift in consumer preference for ‘wants’ instead of ‘needs.’ Given the macroeconomic clouds, it makes intuitive sense that consumers will rationally shift away from discretionary spending categories without curbing their demand for essentials. Walmart is better positioned than Target TGT for such an environment, given its significantly bigger grocery business.However, we should keep in mind that consumers aren’t moving away from all discretionary categories as they continue to spend on leisure, hospitality, and travel services. Consumers spent heavily on discretionary ‘goods’ during Covid and seem to be in no hurry to replace them. But they seem to be making up for missing out on the ‘experiential’ discretionary services of the type mentioned above.Some of this is likely tied to income distributions as well, with lower-income consumers restricting their spending to their needs and pulling back on discretionary spending of all types.An excellent example of this is Friday’s Foot Locker FL bombshell, with the company not only missing estimates but significantly cutting guidance for the year. Foot Locker is heavily exposed to lower-income consumers, and that demographic’s outlook remains uncertain, particularly if the labor market starts losing ground going forward because of macroeconomic factors.Story continuesThe retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times, and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory. Otherwise, they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise, as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart WMT and Target TGT last year.Then there is outright theft, referred to as ‘shrink’ by the retailers. Target estimates that ‘shrink’ will be a $500 million hit to its earnings this year. Most management teams shy away from quantifying the full extent of this problem. But published comments from retail industry professionals suggest that the problem has never been this big.Retailers also need to ensure they have the correct type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much patio furniture last Spring that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target, and others face daily.Both Walmart and Target have done an excellent job on the inventory front, but part of the reason for the Foot Locker guidance cut is the inventory pileup. What is most intriguing concerning Foot Locker is that they failed to see any of this during their March 2023 update.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so.You can see this in the one-year performance of Walmart (blue line, up +26.2%) and Target (red line, down -0.8%) relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line, up +8%). We added Foot Locker (orange line, down -2.3%) to the mix to show the stock’s dramatic fall after the aforementioned earnings disappointment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s official industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 26 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already include the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +6.2% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 84.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart)Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 19th, we now have Q1 earnings from 473 S&amp;P 500 members, or 94.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 78% beating EPS estimates and 74.8% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 150 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. This week’s docket includes Lowe’s, Nvidia, Best Buy, Ralph Lauren, Dicks Sporting Goods, and others.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 459 index members in other recent periods.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the companies that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.8% on +4.4% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get to down earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That’s what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in-line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchActual results provide a lot better on this front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases, with the outperformance particularly notable for the Tech sector.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne notable recent development on the earnings front, which we have been flagging in recent weeks, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings are flat or unchanged as a whole and +0.4%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Decoding Recent Positive Earnings Estimate Revisions  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is the first report since its historical restructuring that split the company into six business units and also the first since COVID-19 restrictions were eased at the end of last year.Fourth Quarter HighlightsRevenue for the quarter ended on March 31st amounted to $29.6 billion, missing estimates but rising 2% YoY. Although non-GAAP diluted earnings per share missed expectations as they amounted to 1.34 yuan, they were up 35% YoY. The adjusted net profit rose 38% YoY as it rose up to $4.0 billion.A Slow Start Of The YearLike Amazon, Walmart and Home Depot, Alibaba observed a slow start of the year with total sales of physical goods. But China, where Alibaba operates generates almost half of the world’s global online transactions, saw its retail sales in April rise 18.4% and Alibaba said it already observed a positive momentum in March after the initial slowdown. However, results didn’t show the improvement for March as analysts had hoped.The Cloud SpinoffThe Chinese “Amazon” revealed that the cloud unit will be spined off into a newly listed company. Being a major player in China, Alibaba wants to face off U.S. titans, namely Amazon and Microsoft Inc (NASDAQ: MSFT). Wedbush Securities analyst Dan found this to be a no-brainer move and step in the right direction.While Microsoft topped cloud expectations with its latest reported quarter, this unit was a weak spot during the reported quarter as sales dropped 3% YoY, mostly due to January’s delivery delays due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a loss of top overseas customer. Even Amazon warned of a cloud growth slowdown in its latest reported quarter.What is also interesting is that Alibaba’s quarterly report also came with a mission statement of the Chinese titan working to make cloud computing more affordable and accessible.Story continuesAI Is Expected To Become A Major DriverAlibaba’s cloud comes hand in hand with AI. Like Microsoft, Alibaba developed its own ChatGPT-style generative AI tool earlier this year which is expected to help accelerate customer adoption of its cloud computing service. CEO Daniel Zhang is expecting this technology to bring an exponential increase in computing power.Splitting Into Units Is A Story That Has Yet To Play OutAlibaba’s story continues to be written as the company has taken steps towards unlocking the value of its business. While its tech peers in the U.S. are cautiously turning around, Alibaba’s results have significantly improved, with the latest results being significantly stronger from last year’s comparable quarter. Considering that the latest quarter had the strongest growth rate in the fiscal year that was just closed, momentum is on Alibaba’s side. Meanwhile, both Microsoft and Amazon gave cautious and lackluster guidance. If other things remain equal and this trend continues, Alibaba could bring in significantly higher profits in the undergoing fiscal year.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

39,11b2cee5-e1a2-3e0e-ae1e-d7a4f1a6b7be,EQR,2023-05-20,3 Housing Stocks That Are Resilient to Home Price Fluctuations,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-housing-stocks-resilient-home-184649423.html,1684176409,STORY,"['AVB', 'EQR', 'MAA']","[Most housing stocks could come under pressure this year. After all, persistently high mortgage rates and home prices, coupled with concerns around inflation, bank sector chaos, weakening economic growth, and a very real possibility of recession have kept a lot of potential homebuyers on the fence. Granted, median existing home sales fell about 0.9% year over year, which is the second consecutive month of declines. However, total existing home sales are down about 22% year-over-year. With that, we’re likely to see additional housing price fluctuations.Notably, “If current economic conditions persist, with elevated mortgage rates and home prices amid scarce inventory, the market is likely in for a long, slow climb and a few bumps along the way,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, as noted by Forbes.com.While most of the housing market will remain a tough place to invest in for the foreseeable future, there are still some housing stocks that may prove resilient.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLook at apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs), for example. Sky-high home prices and mortgage rates pushing down affordability, boosting demand for rentals. For example, according to Robb Report, the number of households rented by people making $150,000 or more increased to three million between 2016 and 2021. That’s an 87% jump in just five years. And while rents are on the rise, many are better off financially if they hold off on buying until home prices cool off.That makes housing stocks, such as apartment REITs even more attractive.EQREquity Residential$62.24AVBAvalonBay Communities$178.11MAAMid-American Apartment Communities$151.40Equity Residential (EQR)Woman hands holding home model, small miniature white toy house. Mortgage property insurance dream moving home and real estate concept. Case-Shiller, housing market.Source: David Gyung / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 4.2%, Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) is one of the largest multifamily REITs on the market. It has about 301 properties spread across the U.S., including 79,351 rental units. What’s impressive here is that EQR just had another strong quarter, with normalized funds from operations (FFO) growing 13% year-over-year. These metrics were driven by stronger leasing trends. Even same-store revenue was up 9.2% year-over-year, thanks to higher demand.Story continuesAnalysts like EQR are here, too. Piper Sandler, for example, just raised its price target to $63 from $59, with an underweight rating. The firm added that “Earnings show apartments are more durable than anticipated following the post-pandemic rent hikes and corporate layoffs.”AvalonBay Communities (AVB)Instability In Real Estate Market, housing market crashSource: Romolo Tavani / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 3.7%, AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) is another hot apartment REIT to consider.Currently, AVB holds about 295 apartment communities with 88,826 apartment homes in 12 states. Just as impressive, AVB had a solid quarter, with a 13.4% gain in FFO per share. Same-store total revenue was also up 9.4% to $629.9 million.And while its focus has been in high-cost areas like New York and Los Angeles, it’s expanding into the South Florida, North Carolina, and Texas markets. Plus, with apartment demand as strong as it is, AVB should continue to grow its rental income, and maybe even increase its yield.Piper Sandler raised its price target on AVB to $193 from $160. Just as we saw with EQR, earnings show apartment rentals are still far more durable than other real estate asset classes right now.Mid-American Apartment Communities (MAA)Real estate growth graph, housing marketSource: bluebay / Shutterstock.comThere’s also the Mid-American Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) REIT. With a yield of 3.65%, MAA has a portfolio of 300 apartment communities, with 102,000 rental units.The REIT, which has been public-traded for about 28 years now, has paid out 117 consecutive quarterly cash dividends. It’s also raised its dividend every year for the last 13 years. Better, its Q1 FFO came in at $2.28, a three-cent beat. Revenue, up 11.1% year over year to $52.9.03 million, beat by $630,000.Plus, as noted by Seeking Alpha, “Higher interest rates benefit MAA, as higher mortgage payments resulted in some buyers being priced out of single-family homes, resulting in stickier demand for MAA’s apartment communities. This is reflected by occupancy remaining stable at 95.5%.”On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

XYL is benefiting from strong backlogs, owing to underlying demand. Also, due to the essential nature of the business, the company’s demand remains robust. Pricing actions to mitigate cost inflation are supporting the bottom line. Solid global demand across end markets also bodes well for the company.Effective price realization and strength in both utility and industrial end markets are supporting XYL’s Water Infrastructure segment. The Applied Water segment is gaining from commercial and industrial end markets. Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is benefiting from a robust utility end market, primarily in the United States, due to strong backlog execution. Also, strong price realization and improvement in chip supply bode well.Xylem’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are noteworthy. In 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $217 million, up 6.9% year over year. In the first three months of 2023, it paid out dividends worth $60 million, up 9.1% year over year. The company bought back shares worth $52 million in 2022 and $8 million in the first three months of 2023. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.However, Xylem has been experiencing adverse impacts of cost inflation for a while. In the first three months of 2023, the company’s cost of revenues increased 12.1% year over year, while selling, general and administrative expenses rose 16.5%. High raw material, labor, freight and overhead costs are pushing up the costs of sales. Escalating costs pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. Additionally, higher strategic investments might dent margin performance.XYL’s extensive presence across international markets and its operations are subject to risks associated with unfavorable movement in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues. For 2023, the company expects a 5% decrease in currency rate, which might impact revenues by $150 million and earnings by 16 cents per share.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 27.9, compared with the industry’s 15.3% increase.Stocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted some top-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector.Ingersoll Rand Inc.

Sponsored by global water technology leader Xylem (NYSE: XYL), the survey finds that 75% of respondents intend to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals by 2040 or earlier. 48% of respondents have set a net-zero emissions goal, and 42% have set an emissions reduction goal.""The water sector has an important role in the global effort to reduce GHG emissions,"" said Patrick Decker, President and CEO at Xylem. ""Our sector is energy intensive. However, smart application of technology makes it possible to manage water far more efficiently and affordably. Increasingly, utilities are finding ways to deploy technology to become more resilient and reduce emissions, while also addressing many of their operational concerns.""The implementation of new and innovative products and solutions can help utilities advance their decarbonization strategies. As highlighted in its recently launched 2022 Sustainability Report, Xylem’s cutting-edge technologies have enabled customers to reduce their CO2e footprint by more than 2.8 million metric tons since 2019. Around the world, leading water and wastewater utilities are focusing on such solutions to drive GHG reduction plans.In Europe, for example, 31% of respondents plan on installing more energy-efficient technologies. Others are leveraging digital solutions, with 29% looking into advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and leak detection solutions, and 24% turning to treatment system optimization technologies. Similarly in North America, 35% of respondents plan on implementing plant or asset optimization technologies to advance their decarbonization goals.With 37% of North American respondents citing resilience to extreme storms and floods as a major concern, advanced digital solutions are also helping water managers improve operational and environmental outcomes at an affordable cost. Buffalo Sewer Authority (BSA), U.S., for example, saved $145 million by deploying a smart sewer system that reduced polluted water flowing into its rivers during storm events – ultimately solving a longstanding problem without spending on new infrastructure.Story continues""To bridge resource gaps and serve our communities as efficiently as possible, we need to work smarter,"" Oluwole A. (OJ) McFoy, BSA General Manager, said. ""We have shown this technology is effective and can help ensure that Buffalo is more efficient and prepared for the changing climate and the more intense storms coming our way.""Many utilities ranked process emissions – such as methane and nitrous oxide – close to last in their priorities for action, despite their significant impact, showing that a better understanding of this issue and technological innovation are needed to tackle total water-sector emissions.The decarbonization strategies being deployed by these forward-thinking utilities are captured in Xylem’s recent paper, Net Zero – The Race We All Win.About XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving critical water and infrastructure challenges with innovation.

Watch for Zions (ZION),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-more-6-dividend-yield-115611007.html,1684497371,STORY,"['ZION', 'ASB', 'HBAN']","[In this current backdrop, when the financial sector is facing turmoil due to the regional banking crisis and expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the near term, solid dividend-yielding stocks should be on investors’ radar. Today, we are discussing one such stock – Zions Bancorporation ZION.Headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT, Zions is a diversified financial service provider operating a widespread network of more than 400 branches. The bank has been increasing its quarterly dividend on a regular basis, with the last hike of 8% to 41 cents per share in July 2022.Over the past five years, Zions increased the dividend four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 8.7%. Considering last day’s closing price of $27.24, the company’s dividend yield currently stands at 6.02%. This is impressive compared with the industry average of 3.45% and attractive for income investors as it represents a steady income stream.Zions Bancorporation, N.A. Dividend Yield (TTM)Zions Bancorporation, N.A. Dividend Yield (TTM)Zions Bancorporation, N.A. dividend-yield-ttm | Zions Bancorporation, N.A. QuoteIs the Zions stock worth considering to earn a robust dividend yield? Let’s check out the company fundamentals to understand risk and rewards. This will help us make a proper investment decision.ZION has been witnessing consistent organic growth. The company’s total revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.4% over the last three years (2019-2022) despite recording a fall in 2020. The upward trend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Yet, the deteriorating operating backdrop, given the rising recession fears, is a major near-term headwind. Though we expect total revenues to decline in 2023 and 2024, the same will grow 1.4% in 2025.Net loans and leases (net of unearned income and fees) witnessed a CAGR of 4.5% over the last three years (ended 2022). Though loan balance decreased in the first quarter on gradually declining demand, our estimates for total loans suggest a CAGR of 5.2% over the next three years.Additionally, ZION is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates. With the Federal Reserve expected to keep the rates higher in the near term to combat inflation, the company’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to witness a decent expansion despite a rise in deposit costs. We project NIM to be 3.04% for 2023.Hence, despite near-term headwinds like rising expenses and worsening asset quality, ZION stock is fundamentally solid. So far this year, shares of Zions have plunged 44.6% compared with the industry’s fall of 38.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTherefore, income investors must watch this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock as it will help generate robust returns over time.

Russia also provided funds, know-how and technology to restart a steel mill in Cuba to supply construction materials on the island, according to Cuba state-run media reports.Story continuesTop Russian business leaders lauded Cuba earlier this week for opening the door to Russian investors and for providing them with ""preferential treatment,"" including tariff exemptions, long-term land concessions and ease in repatriating profits.More than 150 Russian businesspeople attended the forum in Havana, according to Cuban officials.SUGAR DEALRussia this week also promised to help revive Cuba's once-vaunted sugar industry, which has nearly collapsed in recent years as its production has plunged to historic lows.Aleksandr Bogatyr, of Russia's Progress Agro, told Reuters on the sidelines of the forum that his firm and Cuban state-run sugar company Azcuba would begin a joint venture as early as next year to overhaul the obsolete ""Uruguay"" sugar mill in Sancti Spiritus province.The firm hopes to eventually export as much as 150,000 tons of sugar per year, about one-third of this year's countrywide target.""Cuba was once one of the top producers (of sugar) on the international market and with this project, working together, we hope to gradually lift levels of output,"" Bogatyr said.He called the project a Russian investment, but declined to give figures.""It would be a significant investment because we'd bring all of the new equipment and organize the supplies necessary to produce cane, such as fertilizer, and specialized technology,"" he said.Bilateral trade between Cuba and Russia reached $450 million in 2022, three times that of 2021, and soared to $137.6 million in the first four months of 2023, nine times that of the same period the previous year, Russian officials said.

The group represents a mix of former executives of oil companies, climate campaigners, energy experts, and corporate leaders such as BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink and Siemens’s supervisory board chairman Joe Kaeser.Two Indians sit on the board, embodying the polar opposites of the struggle against climate change. One of the advisors is Sunita Narain, a famed environmentalist, but the UAE has also picked Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairman of India’s largest private firm, Reliance Industries, which comprises a thriving oil business. Reliance is among the biggest producer of petrochemicals in India and among the top 10 in the world.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesAnd while Ambani has announced a transition towards a green energy future, he still isn’t ready to divest  from the petrochemical sector. Last year, at an annual investors’ summit at Reliance, the billionaire announced a multi-billion dollar plan to expand its footprint in the oil industry.Here’s who will be advising COP28's presidentdatawrapper-chart-JJN2TCOP28's oil and gas ties spark controversyThe UAE is hosting COP28 in Dubai in November and picked Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the country’s state-owned oil and gas company Adnoc, to be the summit’s president.The fact that the newly appointed advisory board features current oil executives including Ambani and Crescent Petroleum president Badr Jafar, and former oil and gas executives such as BP’s Bob Dudley and China Petrochemical Corporation’s Fu Chengyu, is adding to criticism from environmental activists.“While there has clearly been an effort to make the advisory committee inclusive and diverse, it is deeply concerning to see oil and gas interests being consulted on how to run negotiations to phase out their products,” Oil Change International campaigner Romain Ioualalen told Climate Home.Story continuesUnfazed by the criticism, some controversial appointees have defended their involvement with climate change negotiations. Jeffrey Ubben, who’s on the board of American oil and gas producer ExxonMobil, has previously stated that there could be a way to decarbonize fossil fuels rather than to stop its use completely.“If you think about Exxon’s role, it’s to do the hard stuff, and you cannot get to net zero without doing the hard stuff,” Ubben told CNBC upon his appointment to Exxon’s board in April 2021, adding: “To use the existing infrastructure and capture the carbon is probably the least expensive and quickest way to net zero.”COP28 is poised to focus on carbon capture technology as a way to lower the emissions from oil and gas production. The UN’s former climate chief and one of the architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, Christiana Figueres, criticized that approach as “very dangerous” earlier this month.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

He added that the Petrobras application contained numerous technical inconsistencies.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesThe project is part of Petrobras’s larger plan to increase drilling in the Equatorial Margin, an area in northeast Brazil, which analysts believe has the potential to produce 7.5 billion barrels of oil.Petrobras had reportedly earmarked $6 billion over five years in an exploration project for that area. Now, according to an analysis by Reuters, the ruling will likely end all drilling in that region before it even began.The decision to shut down the project also revealed a political evolution for Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.During his first stint as president, between 2003 and 2010, Lula used a surge of resource extraction in the country, including large-scale mining projects and extensive oil drilling, to help fund extensive social welfare programs for under-developed regions of the country.Over a decade later, Lula’s administration has prioritized environmental protection, citing the existential threat of climate change in governing decisions like this one. This balancing act has drawn the ire of some of Lula’s closest political comrades.A high-level Lula ally left the ruling coalition over the drilling decisionSenator Randolfe Rodrigues—who represents Amapa, the state where the drilling was planned—sharply criticized the government’s decision and announced he was leaving his political party in protest.Story continues“[The] decision against research on the coast of Amapá did not listen to the local government or any citizen of my state. The people of Amapa want to have the right to be heard about the possible existence and eventual destination of our riches,” Rodrigues said in a tweet.The loss of Rodrigues, the main opposition leader during Bolsonaro’s presidency and Lula’s presidential campaign director last year, underscores the competing environmental and development visions of Lula’s ruling coalition and the Brazilian left.Lula has managed to juggle these two competing perspectives before. In his previous term, he was able to radically reduce deforestation in the Amazon, while overseeing Brazil’s longest period of economic growth in three decades and bringing 19 million people out of poverty. Then again, he did it by selling a whole lot of oil.Brazil could hit peak oil by the end of the decadeThe regulatory decision comes at a precarious time for Brazil’s oil industry. With Exxon dropping a major drilling project in the country last month after failing to find any oil, Brazil hasn’t seen a major oil discovery in over a decade.That is why Petrobras—hoping to keep up the country’s massive 3.4-million-barrels-per-day export pace—turned its sights to the Equatorial Margin. Without that region, and any other new discoveries, Brazil’s oil production is forecast to peak at 4.6 million barrels a day in 2030, according to a Bloomberg report.Additionally, with Lula’s decision in March to impose a 9.2% export tax on the oil industry likely scaring foreign companies away from investing in new exploration, it seems like Brazil’s oil boom might be coming to an end.Related stories:🇧🇷 Bolsonaro is headed back to Brazil to energize the far right⛏️ Chile is nationalizing new lithium production, vowing “no more mining for the few”🌳 Latin America’s pink tide is preparing for the green revolutionMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

But oil bulls still had some hurrah: the first weekly rise in five from gains between Monday and Wednesday.President Joe Biden and his main Republican rival in Congress Kevin McCarthy had previously said they were closer than before to a deal to raise the $31.4 trillion U.S. debt ceiling, and that a conclusion could come as early as Sunday to avoid a federal default on payments by June 1.By Friday though, it was clear that the talks were going nowhere. “White House is not being reasonable,” said a headline citing Republican debt negotiators. Another, which ran on Fortune.com and quoting Republican negotiator Garret Graves, was more affirmative on the standoff. “It’s time to press pause because it’s just not productive,” Graves was quoted as telling reporters.McCarthy himself said: “We’ve got to get movement from the White House, and we don’t have any movement yet.” He added that he and Biden had not spoken on Friday.Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, added: “A big risk for debt-limit talks [was] that negotiations were too easy and that could have triggered an early vote.""Referencing the bailout package negotiations during the 2008-2009 Great Financial Crisis, Moya said: “Wall Street has seen this movie before and we needed to see some tension amongst negotiators, in order for a reasonable deal to be reached.”New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled down 31 cents, or 0.5%, at $71.55 per barrel. Week-to-date though, WTI was up about 2%. The U.S. crude benchmark fell a cumulative 15% over four prior weeks.London-traded Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil, settled down 28 cents, or 0.4%, at $75.58. For the week, Brent was also up 2% after four previous weeks of losses totaling 14%.Both WTI and Brent had rallied by more than $1 earlier on Friday on optimism that the debt ceiling talks were making progress.Story continues“Traders were reluctant to go into the weekend short, on the off chance that an agreement to raise the U.S. government’s debt ceiling is struck over the weekend,” Vandana Hari, founder of oil markets advisory Vanda Insights, said in comments carried by Reuters.Craig Erlam, another analyst at OANDA, concurred. “[A U.S. debt] default was almost certainly never a realistic possibility in the first place,” Erlam said.Also boosting oil was a weaker dollar, which makes commodities like crude which are priced in the greenback more affordable to holders of other currencies. The Dollar Index was down for the first time in five sessions even as some speculators held to the belief that the Federal Reserve will raise rates for an 11th straight time when the central bank’s policy makers meet on June 14.Related ArticlesOil down as U.S. debt talks hit brakes; Crude still up on weekOil slips as debt talks pause, Fed warns of high inflationCalifornia grid operator signs off on $7.3 billion of power lines]"

Tuition, books and other expenses have been rising precipitously for decades. Check out this chart below:2023-24 Academic Year Undergraduate Cost of Attendance In-state Undergrad On CampusIn-state Undergrad Living with ParentsTuition/Fees$6,380$6,380Books, Course Materials, Supplies, Equipment$1,450$1,450Transportation$1,570$1,570Living Expenses$11,500$4,130 How can you make sure you have sufficient funds when the time comes for your child to go to college? Student loans can help, but much has been written about the devastating effects these loans have on college graduates getting started in the adult world while trying to pay rent, buy a car or save in a 401(k) or individual retirement account (IRA).The best answer to having enough money saved for your child reaches college age is by starting early and contributing each year. One popular real estate investment trust (REIT) could help that process enormously. Take a look at how it works:Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a San Diego-based, triple-net lease retail REIT with over 12,400 properties around the world. The Monthly Dividend Company, as it is widely known, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and an S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, with 635 consecutive monthly dividends paid and 120 dividend increases since 1994. It is one of the most widely held REITs among investors today because of its stability and growth.Over the years, Realty Income’s growth has been both stable and remarkable. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994, Realty Income has had a 14.6% compound annual total return. Its beta versus the S&amp;P 500 is only 0.5, so bear markets won’t deplete your principal balance too badly.Realty Income’s median adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share growth since 1996 is 5%. And since the IPO, its monthly paying dividend has a compound annual dividend growth rate of 4.4%.Story continuesAs for tenant stability, Realty Income’s historical median for its portfolio occupancy is 98.3%. Its largest tenants include Walgreens, Dollar Tree, 7-Eleven, FedEx, CVS, Walmart and LA Fitness.Because of its large size, some analysts have recently cautioned that Realty Income’s growth could be limited in the future. But on May 3, Realty Income proved the naysayers wrong with a terrific first-quarter earnings report.Funds from operations (FFO) of $1.04 per share beat both the estimates and FFO of the first quarter of 2022 by $0.03 per share. Revenue of $944.39 million beat the estimates by $61.31 million and was 17% better than its revenue of $643.26 million in the first quarter of 2022.Realty Income also raised its full-year 2023 guidance for FFO per share, from $4.01-$4.03 to $4.05-$4.15 and said it ended the first quarter with a 99% occupancy rate. It’s difficult to beat numbers like that.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketGiven these facts, how do you make Realty Income pay for your child’s college? The answer is through a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA), using a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) on the shares you purchase. Contributions grow and are tax-free but only if withdrawn for qualified education expenses. If the money is used for nonqualified purposes, you will be subject to a 10% penalty on the amount withdrawn.You can contribute up to $2,000 annually unless your household modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is above $190,000. The contribution amount phases out between $190,000 and $220,000, and above that would make you ineligible for an ESA.Suppose you begin with a $2,000 contribution when the child is 3 years old. Realty Income is presently trading at around $60 per share, so that’s 33.33 shares to start. Each year at the same time you will contribute an additional $2000. The monthly dividend of $0.255 or annual dividend of $3.06 presently yields just over 5%.Calculating an average annual share price increase of 4% and a 4% dividend increase each year, at the end of 15 years, your $30,000 in contributions could increase to $82,715, for a total return of 158.49%. Of that amount, $34,127 is from dividends being reinvested.Dividend reinvestment with a monthly payer has a slight advantage over using a quarterly payer because the funds compound sooner. If Realty Income was a quarterly payer, the end amount would be about $350 less.The plan works best with the ESA because it’s tax-free, but if you don’t qualify for an ESA you can still use the same plan in a taxable account, albeit with larger annual contributions to make up for the taxes you’ll have to pay on the dividends received.Consult with an accountant or other financial professional before starting this plan to make sure that you understand all of its rules and regulations and that you qualify. While nobody can predict how much college tuition and other expenses will be in 15 years, reinvesting Realty Income dividends in an ESA could certainly go a long way toward meeting those costs.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

Gorman is one of the longest serving heads of a US bank. And once his successor is installed, he'll move to executive chairman for a period of time to help with the transition.And Seana, when you look at the move we saw in Morgan Stanley's stock today, that really points to the influence and the way in which investors have looked to James Gorman here. The stock down about 2 and 1/2% or just over that. He has been sort of the face of stability within the banking sector since he's taken the helm at in 2010.So it will be really interesting to see who that successor is going to be because especially in this environment, we have seen any kind of headline really moving. We're talking about big banks, not regional banks. But still, James Gorman, when you think about where he has been, he has been that face of stability within the sector.SEANA SMITH: Yes, certainly, you can see the jitters there from investors, just on the news of this, even though it's not expected to happen for several months. When we're talking about who could potentially succeed him, there's three names that are being looked at right now.But James Gorman, like you said there, Akiko, has really transformed the bank, turning it into a leader in the wealth management space when you take a look at some of the strategic acquisitions that he has made over the last several years, including Etrade, including Eaton Vance, clearly boosting that side of the business. It accounts for about 45% of the revenue in its most recent quarter. So Morgan Stanley without James Gorman, I think investors are a little bit nervous for exactly what that could maybe look like.]"

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks. 2023 was a tough year for some sectors of the stock market, or at least for some sectors. The market has had a tumultuous couple of years, which started with the outbreak of the coronavirus. The pandemic cut stock markets' value by nearly one third, but the resulting recovery was equally stunning as well. The recovery proved to be a boon for the technology sector, as lockdowns grew the demand for their products. Whether it was retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), who helped people do their shopping from home, or firms like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), whose computing products surged into consumer's hands, or even companies like Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), who surged on the stock market when the demand for remote work and video conferencing boomed, the post-pandemic stock market recovery was a great time to be in technology stocks.Yet, as they say, all good things must come to an end - so did this good fortune for the technology companies on the stock market. In 2022 as the after effects of the expansionary fiscal policies of the pandemic government and the Russian invasion of Ukraine made their mark, technology companies dropped on the market and bled investors dry. Yet, it appears as if hedge funds are now taking these price drops as an opportunity to buy on the dip. This has been the trend in some of the hedge fund portfolios that we have analyzed so far after their filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed portfolio compositions. For instance, billionaire David Tepper's 2023 portfolio has several new stock additions that are technology companies. These include NVIDIA and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), alongside a 390% growth in investment in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Another popular hedge fund that increased exposure to the technology industry is Bill Ackman's Pershing Square which took up a cumulative $1.06 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Story continuesThis trend, as you'll find out today, is also present when we look at another billionaire hedge fund manager's investment portfolio for Q1 2023. This manager is Dan Loeb who heads the hedge fund Third Point Management. Third Point is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with its portfolio currently worth $6.1 billion according to Insider Monkey's research. The portfolio's size is yet to reach the level at which it stood by the end of Q1 2022, but is slowly growing to touch the previous levels.Like some of his other hedge fund peers, Mr. Loeb is also a billionaire with Forbes Magazine placing his latest net worth estimate at $3.5 billion. His hedge fund employs a variety of trading strategies on the financial markets. These include activist investments, venture capital investments, structured and corporate credit strategies, and long and short equity investments. This enables the firm to take a look at the debt strategies of companies to leverage them to its advantage, profit from corporate management weaknesses, and capitalize on share price movements in both directions.As for Mr. Loeb, he started tinkering with the stock market during his time in high school and continued it into college as well. He was initially quite successful, and during his time at Columbia University, he would end up making $120,000. Yet, his inexperience in the stock market made him invest all of it into a medical equipment company to lose the winnings - an occurrence that would provide him practical experience about the perils of placing all your eggs in a single basket. Before setting up Third Point Management in 1995, he would work in the financial and corporate world for a decade.He's quite popular in the investment world as well, especially when it comes to letter writing. His latest letter was sent to the embattled firm Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. The letter criticized the firm's chairwoman and shared:Since our engagement with Ms. Nash began, we have detected a pronounced aversion to including a shareholder representative on the Board. At the same time as we identified Ms. Brady, we proposed a fellow shareholder with impeccable credentials as a second candidate. This individual has years of public market experience, an exemplary record as a corporate director of a larger company, and a strong relationship with one of the top consumer investment companies in the world. Ms. Nash, who was presumably speaking on behalf of the Board, gave unconvincing explanations for rejecting this candidate.Shortly after rebuffing our candidate, and within a week of accepting Lucy Brady (though, oddly without recognizing our role in proposing her), yesterday, the Company hastily announced the appointment of Steve Voskuil to the Board. While we recognize Mr. Voskuil’s financial experience, this Board’s handpicked new director does not assuage our concerns about substantial corporate governance shortcomings. It is further concerning that the Board added a shareholder-identified candidate without being fully transparent about the process that led to her selection.It seems as if this Board is operating in triage mode rather than via best corporate governance practices. We fear the reason that the Board is reacting this way is because they (and others) have many reasons to close the curtain before shareholders can take a closer look at what transpired on their watch.So, wondering what's on Mr. Loeb's mind these days? Well, you came to the right place as we look at precisely that in this article, with some top picks being HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Dan Loeb's latest stock picks, we look at the fund's latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and and picked the ten firms by investment in which Third Point had initiated new stakes in the first quarter.Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks10.

Recently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange has often been observed to outperform more balanced exchanges like the Dow on down days. That’s a sharp about-face from a few months ago, when the Nasdaq almost always underperformed relative to other exchanges. It suggests that downside risk is decreasing in the world of tech stocks.This is certainly related to slowing interest rate hikes. Those higher rates resulted in massive trouble throughout 2022 across tech. That said, these changing tides again put tech stocks in the driver’s seat as it relates to growth opportunities.Here are seven of the top opportunities I’m looking at right now in the world of tech.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsImpinj (PI)Radio microphone in a soundproofed room with an ""on air"" sign in the background.Source: radioshoot/ShutterStock.comImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) is one of the top tech stocks to keep a close eye on for growth opportunities moving forward. The firm provides radio frequency solutions that help connect everyday items to the internet. The result is increased data about items, that promises to lead to greater insights for consumers and companies. The notion that the internet of things (IoT) will lead to better products that better reflect consumer needs is a primary reason it is such a hot sector.Just how high those growth rates are may surprise. It’s expected the IoT space will grow at a compounding annual rate of approximately 26% between 2023 and 2030. Impinj, in turn, is well-positioned to provide growth to its investors.Impinj’s most recent earnings report shows even greater growth than those projections suggest. In Q1, Impinj’s sales increased by 57.9% on a year-over-year basis. The positive news for investors is that PI stock is not even close to being fully valued, and remains a unanimous buy rating from Wall Street.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is, in my opinion, the tech stock that best exhibits high growth potential as well as the ability to preserve investor capital. MSFT stock doesn’t necessarily have massive upside above its current price based on analysts’ consensus. But Microsoft is very evidently well-positioned to continue to grow over the long-term.Story continuesThe most salient factor driving this growth is of course Microsoft’s huge $10 billion investment into OpenAI and ChatGPT. Investors’ early perception was an is that Microsoft struck first among big tech firms in securing a foot in the door in AI. Perception is important, but so too is the potential for ChatGPT’s integration into Bing to revitalize Microsoft’s search aspirations. Bing now promises the opportunity to claw back search market share from Google. That growth opportunity is massive.On top of that, Microsoft is fundamentally rebounding as well. The company’s sales and net income increased by 7% and 9% respectively in Microsoft’s Q3 and full 2023 fiscal year. It’s likely that MSFT stock continues to grow via its exposure to AI, while remaining dominant in its other businesses, providing healthy returns for investors.Alphabet (GOOG)google (GOOGL) chrome app on a smartphone screenSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.comWhen AI burst onto the scene earlier this year, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) was perceived to be on its back foot. Microsoft clearly got the jump on the search leader and YouTube owner.But those early perceptions may be shifting again following a recent I/O developers conference. The conference was a clear rebuttal to notions that Microsoft and ChatGPT are the firm to watch. Google announced generative AI tools and products aimed at countering ChatGPT. It is integrating those tools into Google search, clear to say that Bing will not take any ground away from the dominant force in search.The news was well received, as GOOG stock shot up more than 5% in response.It seems fairly clear that both Alphabet and Microsoft are in fortuitous positions currently. Both are likely to receive a continued influx of investor capital. The AI growth opportunity heavily favors big tech. Google’s flat earnings report doesn’t matter now. The company’s share price and valuation is once again untethered from fundamentals as interest rates flatten and Google’s AI aspirations take off.ON Semiconductor (ON)A digital illustration of a globe of network connections.Source: ShutterstockON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) has been among the steadiest chip stocks in this post-pandemic environment. Other semiconductor firms have faltered as the boom evaporates but ON Semiconductor isn’t among them.Global chip sales are falling this year. Gartner expects an overall global sales decline of 11.2% in 2023. Thus, any firm that can avoid such steep declines should logically be considered something of a winner.ON Semiconductor is one such firm. The firm grew by 1% in the first quarter, which not only exceeds those global growth rates, but also exceeded internal expectations.A big factor in the firm’s success is its alignment with growth industries. ON Semiconductor is deeply aligned with the automotive sector. The company’s automotive sector revenues increased by 38% in the most recent quarter, accounting for a record 50% of revenues. ON Semiconductor should see similar performance throughout the remainder of 2023 with flat growth but, again, that’s very strong growth when taken in a relative sense.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock is down roughly 50% from the beginning of the tech rout that began in late-2021. Accordingly, it remains among the most overpriced software firms in existence based on its price-to-earnings ratio .However, Salesforce remains well-regarded by analysts and is a straightforward choice for investors. The reason being Salesforce dominates the customer relationship management market. The firm controls more market share than the next nine biggest firms in the space, and roughly a third of the market overall.And like other dominant tech firms, Salesforce has an AI opportunity that promises to further cement its position. The company is integrating Slack GPT into its Slack platform. The integration promises to increase productivity, saving 3.6 hours of work on an average week for users. That doesn’t mean workers will suddenly have 4 free hours at work. Instead, it means companies like Salesforce that integrate first will have employees with four more hours of productivity weekly to use on other projects. That will add up quickly, and could be monetized accordingly by the company.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) continues to grow quickly despite expectations of an impending recession. Consumer spending and consumer credit continue to increase despite those concerns. In turn, Visa stock continues to exhibit strong growth potential that is reflected in its second-quarter results.Visa’s business is booming due to spiking payments volume that increased by 10% overall. Cross-border payments are especially strong, having increased 24% in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. As a result, revenues increased by 11%, with net income growing by 17%.Analysts remain positive about Visa’s prospects due to the fact that credit card debt is only increasing. American consumers remain unwilling to take on less credit card debt overall. Inflation continues to hurt consumers, who in turn have upped their credit card usage.In any case, the U.S. economy relies heavily on consumption often financed through credit cards. And that points to a continued opportunity for Visa investors, even as worries about the overall economy mount.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of tech stocks to buy is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), a diversified stock for the digital economy. The company hasn’t received much attention recently, as its earnings do not coincide with the normal earnings season. Adobe will release its earnings in mid-June, which by all indications, will likely be strong.Adobe reported record Q1 revenues in mid-March, providing improved revenue guidance for Q2 of between $4.75 to $4.78 billion. Two months later, the average expectation is that Adobe will report $4.77 billion in sales next month.The thesis around this stock is relatively simple. Because Adobe has sort of fallen by the wayside due to the timing of its earnings release, while continuing to project strong growth based on all the data, it remains a stock that could have the greatest potential to pop near-term. Additionally, over the longer-term, it appears that Adobe stands to benefit in a big way from the integration of AI into its creative cloud. AI is certain to make PhotoShop much more productive overall, and Adobe will create dozens of new apps that leverage AI moving forward. As a result, growth should continue for a very long time with this tech behemoth.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Sealed Air's current trading price of US$42.18 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sealed Air’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air What Is Sealed Air Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Sealed Air’s ratio of 15.05x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 12.78x, which means if you buy Sealed Air today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Sealed Air should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Sealed Air’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Sealed Air generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Sealed Air's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 64%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SEE’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SEE? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SEE, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SEE, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Sealed Air at this point in time.

If you want to see more brands in this selection, go to the Top 5 Most Popular Consumer Electronics Brands.According to Zion Industry Research, the size of the consumer electronics industry is set to increase from $1.10 trillion in 2021 to $1.70 trillion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%. China stands out as one of the largest manufacturers of consumer electronic goods. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the industry, considering China's position as the epi-centre of the virus. Regulations regarding social distancing and the closure of businesses led to a global reduction in the sales of electronics. For example, Sony's Electronic Products and Solutions segment experienced a decline in revenue, with sales dropping from 977.4 billion yen ($7.09 billion) in the first half of 2019 to 836.5 billion yen ($6.07 billion) in the first half of 2020 due to retail stores closing down. In addition to Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), companies such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and LG also temporarily halted production in various countries to adhere to government regulations. However, one positive trend that emerged during the pandemic was the increased adoption of remote work, which led to a surge in demand for consumer electronics, particularly computing devices.In addition to the work-from-home trend, the preference for having connected homes is supporting the expansion of the consumer electronics industry. The convenience of enhanced features, such as voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, has led to a growing adoption of appliances equipped with these tools. According to a Value of Video Report 2020 issued by Grabyo, 58% of streaming customers surveyed reported frequent video consumption on a Smart TV. Furthermore, AI technologies and voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana are becoming increasingly prevalent. The market growth of consumer electronics has been further boosted by the increased demand for Asian electronic products in Western countries. According to data from The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, the production value of computers and information terminals in Japan rose by 1251.3 billion yen ($9.07 billion) in 2019 from 1041.1 billion yen ($7.55 billion) in 2017. Additionally, the rising disposable income among the population in South-East Asian nations has led to increased consumption of home appliances. This trend is expected to drive the regional market growth in the next decade.Story continuesThe key players in the consumer electronics industry, such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) are investing heavily in research and development to introduce innovative products to cater to evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements. Meanwhile, government authorities are also actively taking initiatives to support the growth of electronics within their countries. For instance, the Government of India introduced the National Electronics Policy in 2018. The policy intends to provide a framework to achieve a turnover of $400 billion through consumer electronics manufacturing by the middle of this decade. Achieving such a significant number would surely require greater adoption of modern technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and machine learning. Most Popular Consumer Electronics BrandsCopyright: kobby_dagan / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe used a consensus opinion-based rankings approach to shortlist the top 20 most popular consumer electronics brands. We used seven metrics, namely market share, brand recognition, consumer reviews and ratings, website rankings, product range, sales figures, and online presence, to evaluate the popularity of each brand. We referred to over 12 reputable sources, such as Value Today, Reddit threads, and GlobalData, to collate information regarding these metrics. The brands have been ranked in ascending order of their scores, with the maximum attainable score being 70. The methodology employed attempts to provide a holistic view of brand popularity, considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects.Top 20 Most Popular Consumer Electronics Brands20.

Renowned for their technological prowess, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) consumer electronics power high-performance gaming, virtual reality experiences, autonomous vehicles, and data centre solutions.Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our next top contributor on better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. The stock also benefitted from the positive momentum around Artificial Intelligence and the Nvidia chips that drive it. While revenue was down -21% year over year, a rebound in the company’s gaming business helped drive revenue above Wall Street’s expectations.NVDA is the leading designer of graphics processing units (GPU’s) required for powerful computer processing. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved through innovation and adaptation from a predominantly gaming-focused chip vendor to one of the largest semiconductor/software vendors in the world. Over the past decade, the company has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of over 20% while expanding operating margins and, through its asset light business model, producing ever increasing amounts of free cash flow. After working through its near-term slowdown, we expect future growth to remain robust as NVDA chips and software are critical to many of the core technologies being adopted globally, including cloud computing, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.”18. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Total Score: 26TTM Revenue: $284.61 billion Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers a variety of advanced consumer electronics through Google and other subsidiaries.

On April 16, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) made an announcement regarding its acquisition of Polar Security, an innovative company specializing in the monitoring and security of cloud and software-as-a-service application data.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was discussed in the Q4 2022 investor letter of Diamond Hill Capital. Here's what the firm said:“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”16.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.68% as of May 19.Here's what ClearBridge Investments said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”13. Nintendo Co., Ltd.

Microsoft’s net cash balance sheet also seemed to gain appreciation from investors who became more cautious about the economic cycle.”7. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG)Total Score: 39TTM Revenue: $18.08 billionKoninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), commonly known as Philips, is a multinational conglomerate that operates in various industries, including consumer electronics. Philips offers a wide variety of consumer electronics, including televisions, audio systems, lighting solutions, personal care tools, and household appliances.Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) was mentioned in the Q4 2022 investor letter of Artisan Partners. Here’s what the firm said:“Shares of Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), a health care technology company, were hurt by fears regarding the recall of its first-generation CPAP machine and the potential for legal recourse and market share losses arising in its sleep division. Adding to the company’s woes are supply chain disruptions and a worsening macro environment that will weigh on deliveries and customer installations. The stock is down more than 70%, losing more than €30 billion in market value from its April 2021 highs. The stock reaction seems excessive given the likely range of outcomes we see, so we’ve been adding to our position. The sleep division is a small part of the overall business—which we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues. This is a sticky business as medical providers are reluctant to switch over to competitors. We appreciate that until there is greater clarity on the full impact of the recall and how long it may take to resolve, the stock will remain under pressure, but we believe today’s asking price offers the potential for highly attractive multi-year returns.”6. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ)Total Score: 40TTM Revenue: $59.78 billionHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), or the Hewlett-Packard Company, is a Palo Alto, California-based consumer electronics giant known for its laptops, desktop computers, printers, scanners, and accessories.

HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) has established itself as a solid brand among consumers and professionals seeking top-quality computing and imaging equipment.In addition to HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), companies such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

A month later, EU lawmakers urged world leaders to find ways to control AI technologies, saying they were developing faster than expected.The United States so far has taken a cautious approach on governing AI, with President Joe Biden last month saying it remained to be seen whether AI is dangerous. Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the U.S. should consider licensing and testing requirements for development of AI models.Story continuesJapan, this year's chair of G7, has been even more accommodative, pledging support for public and industrial adoption of AI while monitoring its risks. ""It's important to properly deal with both the potentials and risks,"" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the government's AI council last week.The Western nations' differing approaches to AI are in contrast to China's restrictive policy. Its cyberspace regulator in April unveiled draft measures to align generative AI-powered services with the country's core socialist values.While acknowledging differences on how AI should be regulated, the G7 leaders agreed on Friday to create a ministerial forum dubbed the ""Hiroshima AI process"" to discuss issues around generative AI, such as copyrights and disinformation, by the end of this year.The leaders also urged international organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to consider analysis on the impact of policy developments.The summit followed a G7 digital ministers' meeting last month, where its members - the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the EU - said they should adopt ""risk-based"" AI rules.The EU and U.S. are also expected to exchange views on the emerging technologies at the Trade and Technology Council in Sweden on May 30-31.

And since earlier this year, popular Activision Blizzard franchises such as World of Warcraft, the StarCraft series, Overwatch and Diablo have been suspended because of a disagreement between Activision subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment and its Chinese partner, NetEase.Blizzard had a longstanding partnership with NetEase dating to 2008, which helped the latter company grow to become China’s second-largest games distributor after local rival Tencent.But the U.S. company said late last year it would suspend most of its game services in China after current licensing agreements ended, leading to a public spat between the two companies.Microsoft says its planned Activision acquisition — considered the priciest tech deal in history — now has been cleared in 37 countries, which includes the 27 in the EU as well as 10 others such as China, Japan and Brazil. But the blockbuster deal is still in jeopardy because British regulators have rejected it and U.S. authorities are trying to thwart it.]"

Those have been the big drivers of action. Let's talk about how to play this. Ken Mahoney is back here with us, Mahoney Asset Management CEO. Ken, so let's start with your two buys. We know certainly tech has been the outperformer since the start of the year. You've got two picks in this space. First up, Nvidia. I thought this is a bit surprising, given the runup that we've seen, over 100% since January 1st. What's going to keep this momentum to the upside?KEN MAHONEY: Yeah, look, the earnings come out next Wednesday the 24th. Again, I don't have a peek at them, but I think the market is getting behind on their earnings. I mean, this reminds me of that kind of hockey stick growth that we saw with Tesla a few years ago, that valuations matter, but they don't if they're going to grow their top line. AI is a big thing. This is going to dominate. Before, I said, hey, Fed funds and all that's probably the ninth inning. Well, for AI, we're probably more in the second inning, just the beginning of the cycle.Hey, it will have its ups and downs. Recognize the stock is going parabolic. The tactics that we use as kind of buy and hold, maybe 1/2 to 2/3. And maybe trade around and sell some [INAUDIBLE]. At the end of the day, this is where the leadership's going to be, and I still believe there's a lot more upside with Nvidia throughout the rest of the year, even though the stock's already doubled this year.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I can't think about how many times have we heard AI in earnings calls, but when you think about those who have been leading, obviously, Nvidia with the chips. Microsoft certainly been a big leader on that front. It's interesting. We heard from Meta this week talking about having to own the entire stack to be able to scale AI and win in this space. How does Microsoft present an opportunity for you in terms of that and the competition that is just gearing up right now?Story continuesKEN MAHONEY: Look, Microsoft thankfully is not a one trick pony, right? So it has everything from gaming, all the different verticals, from cloud to all the different software. But you can't go without software with Microsoft. And then in addition to that will be AI. And if you look at Microsoft the last few quarters, they beat earnings and they raised guidance, same thing for Nvidia. So these are companies you always want to look for, those companies that can beat on estimates, raise guidance. And I think Microsoft's going to take a little chunk out of the dominant space for Google Search. Even a small market share goes in the right direction, and you get all those many verticals with Microsoft.SEANA SMITH: Ken, more broadly speaking, though, when you take a look at the runup in the tech sector, there was a Bank of America fund manager survey out earlier this week talking about how being long tech is one of the most crowded trades right now. Why aren't you worried about those valuations?KEN MAHONEY: Right, so everybody complains about being narrow leadership. And it is. I mean, that's just the hand that we dealt with this year. I mean, this is the kind of a bull market and a bear market. Pretty much, the Dow is unchanged for the year, and that's up 20%. You can go and hide in PEs of 6 perc-- or PEs of 8, it seems, and they'll still be trading there. Yes, you're paying a higher multiple, but you're getting a higher growth rate.And to me, again, if it's going be narrow leadership, be with the narrow leadership. If it's not going to spread out, it's not going to have strong breadth the way it's been shown, stick with the leaders. I mean, that's how we've been trained. Look at the best industry, the best stocks in those industry. Yes, they'll be volatile, but you're going to be more than compensated for that volatility.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about the other two stocks that you've pointed out to avoid. And I want to talk about KRE. This is an ETF for the regional banking sector because, yes, we have seen just the volatility there. It feels like there's starting to be a bit of a differentiation between the regional banks. Is it your sense here that the bottom-- we've hit the bottom, or do you think there's still more cracks to come when you're looking at some of the other names in the space?KEN MAHONEY: I think there are more cracks to come. The reason I picked out KRE and that's selective, let's say, banks, is, if you wake up one morning, like Pat West or some others, and they're down 10%, you go to KRE. Next thing, they're down 6%. They go down in sympathy. So I just think there's better other opportunities. As I mentioned, AI is all the rage for all the reasons. There's other pockets of strength-- semiconductors, of course. So to be in this space, regionals, you're going to have a strong start. And it's really hard to pick through what's going to make out the other side, which ones are in trouble.And every time there's a problem with just one of them, it comes back and hurts the region. I think you said earlier, for the week, we had a good week, but you saw it closed at the low of the day. And I think, still, there could be a couple of ones out there. And they always take it out of this ETF, it seems.SEANA SMITH: Ken, another pick that you suggest that people avoid is Anheuser-Busch. We know that a lot of people have been closely watching the sales of Bud Light, given the controversy and what has happened over the last several weeks. Do you think there's more downside risk ahead, it sounds like?KEN MAHONEY: Yeah, it can bounce a little bit. I mean, it's gone down so hard. I mean, it was in the high 60s before the controversy started. Below 60, I think it landed sub-60. It could bounce a little bit. It could be a short there. The sales numbers are pretty amazing, 27% week over week. You know, I didn't know it was going to be so sticky, but it is very sticky. And then looking at it, it looks very tempting. Say, hey, the stock was 70, and because of controversy, that will blow over. I'm not so sure it's going to blow over that quickly. It still remains sticky. And therefore, we would avoid that stock, as tempting as it may look, being down so much in the last couple of weeks.AKIKO FUJITA: Ken Mahoney, Mahoney Asset Management CEO, good to have you on, on this Friday.KEN MAHONEY: All right, thank you. Have a great weekend.]"

Here's How He's Positioning His Bets,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/going-york-mets-owner-steve-192522453.html,1684524322,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[Heightened interest rates have cast a shadow of doubt over stock market optimism, intensifying concerns of a looming economic downturn. Many experts have called for a recession.But billionaire hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen is taking a bullish stance.“I’m making a prognostication — we’re going up,” he said at a private conference, according to Bloomberg.Cohen knows a thing or two about navigating the markets and rising to the top. After all, the hedge fund manager’s career inspired the character Bobby Axelrod, played by Damian Lewis in the TV show “Billions.”Noting that he’s “actually pretty bullish,” Cohen highlighted one specific segment in today’s market: artificial intelligence (AI).He warned that if investors become overly preoccupied with recession concerns, they might miss the “big wave” of opportunities in AI.The billionaire investor is putting his money where his mouth is. According to the latest Form 13F filing of his firm Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has placed quite a few bets in the AI arena. Here’s a look at three notable ones.Don't miss:'People-First' Real Estate Fund Shares Rent With Tenants While Generating Strong Returns For InvestorsElon Musk Issues Dire Warning For The Real Estate Market And This Investment Strategy Could Produce Massive Returns If He's RightAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)As the parent company of Google, Alphabet Inc. was created in 2015 to give Google’s wild ideas some room to play. The company boasts a vast array of ventures, from dominating the search engine market to dabbling in self-driving cars and life sciences.Commanding a market cap of over $1.5 trillion, Alphabet is a tech behemoth. But the stock can still be volatile. Shares plunged 39% in 2022 but have surged 37% so far in 2023.Some consider the increasing popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT a threat to Alphabet's business. But Alphabet is not standing still, as the company is also advancing its own AI products.Story continues“In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings conference call last month. “We've since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful, and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation.”As of March 31, Cohen’s firm owned 3.31 million shares of Alphabet, worth $343.01 million at the time.Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA)Point72 Asset Management also held 980,638 shares of Nvidia, valued at $272.39 million at the end of March.Known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia stock has been on a tear.Year to date, shares have shot up 120%.The rise of AI may have something to do with investor enthusiasm for the chipmaker.In an earnings release in February, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that AI “is at an inflection point.”And that could present a major opportunity for the company.“We are set to help customers take advantage of breakthroughs in generative AI and large language models,” Huang said. “Our new AI supercomputer, with H100 and its Transformer Engine and Quantum-2 networking fabric, is in full production.”Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT)These days, it’s hard to discuss AI stocks without mentioning Microsoft. After all, it has made notable investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm.During the company’s latest earnings conference call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, “The age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it.”Indeed, Microsoft Azure — the software giant’s cloud computing arm — is OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider.Nadella said that Microsoft will deploy OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products.Microsoft shares have climbed 33% in 2023, bringing the company’s market cap to $2.37 trillion.At the end of the first quarter, Cohen’s firm owned 449,115 shares of Microsoft, a stake valued at approximately $129.48 million at the time.The Bottom LineAI companies hold potential. But it’s crucial to bear in mind that stocks, especially high-growth names, can be volatile. And even experts like Cohen do not have a 100% win rate. If your goal is to earn a steady return without too many wild swings in your portfolio, you might want to look into reliable income plays — both in and outside the stock market.Read next: How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhile REITs Are Struggling, Private Market Real Estate Pulls In Huge ReturnsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Betting against the housing market, Burry foresaw its collapse and pocketed huge profits.With the global economy once again appearing fragile, in recent times, Burry, who runs hedge fund Scion Asset Management, has periodically waded with forecasts of doom – warning of looming financial disaster on account of a mix of still overvalued stocks, uncontrollable inflation and the prospect of a multi-year recession.However, despite his pessimistic outlook, Burry has not ceased his stock picking activities. The recent quarter saw him loading up on several equities, and we decided to get the lowdown on a pair of his latest picks.We ran these tickers through the TipRanks database to get a bird’s eye view of their prospects and see whether there’s widespread agreement these stocks might be worth buying right now. Here are the results.Signet Jewelers (SIG)Even during economic downturns, fingers will still need to be slot into rings and that in essence is the defensive value proposition of Signet Jewelers.Touting its status as the world’s largest diamond jewelry retailer, Signet operates a diverse portfolio of retail brands, including Zales, Kay Jewelers, and Jared, amongst others. In business since 1949, Signet Jewelers has built a reputation for offering a wide range of high-quality jewelry pieces, from engagement rings to fashion accessories. The company has a strong presence in North America and the United Kingdom, with approximately 2,800 store locations across these regions. In addition to their brick-and-mortar stores, Signet Jewelers has expanded its online presence, allowing customers to conveniently shop for jewelry through their e-commerce platforms.Despite falling revenues, the company exceeded Q4 estimates and provided an upbeat outlook in the most recently reported statement for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (January quarter). Revenue saw a 5.3% year-over-year decline to $2.66 billion, yet just edged ahead of the consensus estimate. At the other end of the scale, EPS of $5.52 came in ahead of the $5.43 forecast. Looking ahead, for FY24, Signet sees adjusted EPS hitting the range between $11.07 – $11.59, above consensus at $10.68.Story continuesIt’s clear that Burry saw something worthwhile in Signet; during Q1, he opened a new position by loading up on 125,000 SIG shares, which now command a value over $9.27 million.He’s not the only one showing confidence. Following the company’s recent investor day, Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow lays out the reasons to back the jewelry giant.“With numerous structural rev/margin tailwinds in place, SIG’s 3-5 Yr targets appear achievable,” the analyst said. “While the macro backdrop will remain difficult through most of FY24, mgmt has provided visibility into a rev inflection in 4Q and into FY25. We believe investor confidence in mgmt’s operational prowess is growing and DD (double digit) OM (targeting 11-12%), appears sustainable.”These comments underpin Boruchow’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating while his $100 price target suggests the shares will post gains of 35% over the next 12 months. (To watch Boruchow’s track record, click here)Overall, of the 5 recent analyst reviews on file here, 2 are to Buy against 3 to Hold, for a Moderate Buy consensus. The stock is currently trading at $74.21 and its $88.60 average price target suggests it will rise ~19% over the next 12 months. The company also provides a small bonus in the form of regular dividends, which currently yield an annual rate of 1.16%. (See SIG stock forecast)JD.com (JD)Judging by the next stock endorsed by Burry, he must be betting on the ongoing recovery of the Chinese economy. Burry has been making lots of room in his portfolio for JD.com, a leading Chinese e-commerce company. During Q1 he increased his JD holdings by 234% with the purchase of 250,000 shares. These are currently worth $9.33 million.Founded in 1998, JD.com, also known as Jingdong, has emerged as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China, offering a wide range of products including electronics, apparel, home goods, and fresh food. The company’s success can be put down to its strong logistics network, efficient delivery system, and commitment to providing authentic and high-quality products. JD has also been actively leveraging emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, to enhance its operational efficiency and personalize customer recommendations.It’s a model that worked in the e-commerce giant’s favor in the recently reported Q1 results. Revenue climbed by just 1.4% year-over-year to $35.4 billion, yet the figure came in $560 million above the forecast. The company’s non-GAAP net margin increased by 140 bps from 1.7% in the same period a year ago to 3.1%. This helped JD deliver non-GAAP EPADS of $0.69, some distance above the $0.5 predicted by the analysts. There was also an announcement of a new CEO which investors appeared to respond positively to. The latest print and changes at the firm also gets the thumbs up from Barclays analyst Jiong Shao.“What’s significant here in our view is that despite the concerns around price war since JD started its own 10bn RMB subsidy program a few months ago, the company delivered better-than-expected margins and raised its margin outlook. This may reflect a relatively healthier competitive environment than feared,” Shao opined.“Only weeks after its announcement of re-organization, JD has announced new senior management and heads of business units. It is a transition year for JD and we do consider JD’s in-house logistics capabilities set it apart from all its e-commerce competitors, and the company is likely to come out of the transition year as a stronger and more nimble company,” the analyst went on to add.To support this perspective, Shao maintains an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on JD shares, accompanied by a $52 price target. This forecast suggests the potential for a 39% increase in value over the next 12 months. (To watch Shao’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 12 Buys and 4 Holds, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The analysts see shares climbing 66.5% higher over the next year, considering the average target stands at $62.18.

Two cars are parked outside.Walgreens reached a $230 million settlement deal with San Francisco for its role in the opioid epidemic, after a landmark trial last year that found the pharmacy giant liable for fueling the crisis.A press release published yesterday (May 17) from the San Francisco city attorney’s office said that a total of $229,610,000 would be paid to the city over 14 years, with most of the funds paid over the first eight years.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikes“Opioids have wreaked havoc across our nation leading to immense suffering and untold damage,” city attorney David Chiu said in a statement. “This historic agreement ensures Walgreens is held accountable for the crisis they fueled and our City receives appropriate resources to combat the opioid crisis and bring relief to our communities.”Chiu said at a press conference yesterday, quoted in Reuters, that the payout marks the biggest opioid-related settlement won by a local government in the US.Quartz has reached out to Walgreens for comment.One big number: $8.1 billionThe settlement agreement is just a fraction of the amount San Francisco said it needs from Walgreens to address its opioid crisis. A brief filed in October in California’s Northern District Court said the city requires an estimated $8.1 billion (pdf) paid over 15 years to implement a “well-coordinated, longitudinal, multi-stakeholder” abatement plan.In November, the drugstore chain agreed “in principle” to pay $4.95 billion over 15 years to various state and local governments, as well as federally recognized tribes, to settle drug-related lawsuits. Litigation did take a chunk out of Walgreens’s bottom line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in a $3.7 billion loss.Walgreens played a significant role in San Francisco’s opioid crisisThe latest settlement follows a historic ruling (pdf) last August, in which US district court judge Charles Breyer found that Walgreens knowingly handed out “large volumes of medically illegitimate opioid prescriptions” in San Francisco, that were a “substantial factor” in its drug crisis.Story continuesSan Francisco sued several drug manufacturers and dispensers in 2018, including Walgreens, alleging that their “corporate practices” flooded the city with drugs and led to a rise in opioid addiction. Since then, a series of companies, like Endo, CVS, and Walmart have agreed to settle their cases with the city for millions of dollars.In 2013, Walgreens agreed to pay record civil penalties, at the time, of $80 million for “record-keeping and dispensing violations” at a distribution center and six retail pharmacies in Florida.San Francisco’s opioid crisis, by the digits163,645,704: Opioids distributed in San Francisco from 2006-2014, enough for each person to receive 22 pills each year478: Percent increase in the city’s opioid-related deaths from 2015-202049: People per 100,000 in San Francisco who died from an overdose in 2020, compared to 13 in 100,000 in 2010620: Accidental drug overdose deaths in San Francisco in 2022, a slight decrease from 640 in 2021 and 725 in 2020.Related stories😶‍🌫️ Minnesota is trying to prove Juul got teens addicted on vaping in a first-of-its-kind trial💊 The US may make anti-overdose drug naloxone available over the counter in 2024🤔 Most Americans can’t tell whether they are being prescribed opioidsMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So while Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Paychex:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.42 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$11b - US$6.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).So, Paychex has an ROCE of 42%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Professional Services industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for Paychex roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Paychex compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Paychex's ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Paychex doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 58%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.On a side note, Paychex has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 56% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Either way, they're still at a pretty high level, so we'd like to see them fall further if possible.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Paychex is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 91% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Paychex could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation  on our platform quite valuable.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right Now.The magnitude of fast food consumption in the United States is substantial. Fast food plays a significant role in American spending habits, as consumers allocate a massive portion of their budgets to these establishments. Billpin reports that Americans contribute over $275 billion to the global fast-food industry, representing 18% of total expenditure. On an individual level, the average American spends approximately $1,200 annually on fast food. Collectively, the total expenditure on fast food in 2021 exceeded $200 billion. When considering a lifetime, the cumulative spending on fast food accumulates to around $70,000.The popularity of fast food is evident, with an estimated 50 million Americans consuming it daily. The global fast food market is valued at $931.7 billion. Notably, 80% of Americans visit a fast-food restaurant monthly, while 20% indulge weekly, and 23% of US adults consume it three or more times a week. Disturbingly, 34% of children aged 2 to 19 consume fast food daily.Factors Influencing Fast Food PricingConsidering the vast fast food consumption in the United States, it becomes essential to understand the factors that influence fast food pricing. These factors shape the cost structure and profitability of fast-food chains and provide insights into the pricing decisions made by these establishments. Here are several key factors that affect fast food pricing:Ingredient Sourcing and Cost: The cost of ingredients influences pricing, and fast food chains prioritize affordable and readily available options.Economies of Scale and Supply Chain Efficiency: Large chains negotiate bulk deals, optimize supply chains, and centralize purchasing to reduce costs.Operational Optimization and Cost Reduction: Streamlined processes, technology integration, and labor management help lower expenses.Rent and Location: High rent and prime locations can increase operating costs and impact pricing.Marketing and Branding: Investments in advertising and promotions play a significant role in shaping overall costs and influencing pricing decisions.Competition: Intense competition leads to price wars and promotional offers to attract customers.Menu Development and Complexity: Menu variety and complex recipes may increase production costs and affect pricing.Seasonal Factors: Specific menu items are impacted by ingredient cost fluctuations, which can be attributed to seasonality or changes in commodity prices.Regulatory Compliance and Costs: The adherence to regulations incurs additional expenses that directly impact pricing decisions.Overhead Expenses: Employee wages, utilities, equipment maintenance, and administrative costs contribute to pricing considerations.Story continuesBy considering these factors, fast food chains can balance customer affordability and maintain profitability. It's important to note that the relative importance of these factors may vary depending on the specific chain, location, and market conditions.Assessing Affordability: Beyond Menu PricesWhen evaluating the affordability of fast food chains, it's essential to consider food prices, menu options, and the overall value offered. While some chains may have lower base costs, they might compensate by offering smaller portion sizes or fewer menu options. On the other hand, higher-priced chains may provide more generous portions or include additional items in their meals, making them a better value proposition.Over the past two decades, fast-food prices have seen a significant shift. As reported by GoBankingRates, in 2002, a Big Mac from McDonald's cost a reasonable $2.39, but today, the price has surged by nearly 50%, approaching the $5 mark. It's essential to remember that this price only includes the burger, excluding the accompanying fries and beverages.Similarly, the price of a Grilled Steak Taco at Taco Bell was $1.49 in 2002. However, if you were to order the same taco now, it would cost an additional $1. On the other hand, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) and Chick-fil-A caused a buzz in 2022 as their meal prices significantly increased, capturing the attention of fast-food enthusiasts, as reported by CNET. Chick-fil-A saw a substantial surge of 15.6%, resulting in an average meal cost of $4.65. In contrast, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) took it a step further, with prices skyrocketing by 35% compared to 2021. These price adjustments by Chick-fil-A and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) made waves and sparked discussions among consumers and industry observers alike.According to the USDA, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for restaurant purchases showed a 0.6 percent increase in March 2023 compared to February 2023. Additionally, when compared to March 2022, the CPI was 8.8 percent higher. According to projections, food prices are expected to continue rising in 2023, though at a slower pace compared to the previous year. The expected overall increase for all food prices in 2023 is 6.5 percent, falling within a prediction interval of 4.9 to 8.2 percent. These figures indicate that food prices are still expected to grow at rates higher than the historical average.10 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right NowCopyright: bhofack2 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology To determine the 10 cheapest fast-food chains right now, we followed a rigorous methodology.

But if you’re interested in a Starbucks franchise, you’re not completely out of luck.More: Why Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyRelated: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchThe company does license some of its stores, which from an operational standpoint is quite similar to being a franchise owner. Better yet, the Starbucks licensing opportunity is actually fairly large. Out of the more than 35,000 Starbucks outlets throughout the world, 17,458, or about 49%, were licensed as of 2023. If you choose to go this route, here are some of the costs — and hurdles — you should anticipate.Initial Start-Up FundingThe average cost to license a Starbucks store is $315,000. You’ll also need $700,000 in liquid assets to be considered.Take Our Poll: What Are You Worth to Your Company?What Is the Concept Behind Licensing Instead of Franchising?The idea that Starbucks would license rather than franchise its stores comes from its CEO Howard Schulz. The progressive and popular founder has long believed that the complexities of providing a quality Starbucks experience for customers, from the explanation of its products to the actual presentation and operation of its stores, was best controlled by the company itself. Thus, franchises are not part of the company’s business model.But the philosophy doesn’t end there. The company also leverages its licensing model by maintaining certain requirements meant to increase sales for the business. More specifically, it doesn’t simply offer licenses to anyone who applies. Rather, the company only accepts licensees who currently have thriving businesses in good locations that Starbucks can capitalize on. For example, the company actively seeks to add licensed Starbucks locations to these types of existing industries:BusinessUniversityFine diningGovernment or military facilityHealthcareHotel and lodgingTravel and recreationStory continuesReading through the list, it’s obvious how the Starbucks model makes sense. Adding a Starbucks to a high-traffic business or university destination, or a hotel in a popular tourist destination is almost a sure-fire way for the company to generate additional revenue. Plus, the company has the added benefit of working with a licensee who already has a proven track record in operating a business.Is a Licensing Package Similar to Franchising?For the start-up fee, along with ongoing expenses, Starbucks helps licensees operate a successful business. After all, that is why the company doesn’t offer franchises in the first place — it wants control over how the business appears, giving a consistent experience to customers everywhere. So, if you successfully get a Starbucks license, you can expect the company to help you with some or all of the following:Store designThe Starbucks menuEquipmentTraining and supportFoodPromotionsOnsite visitsIn other words, you’ll receive a lot of the same type of support as a franchise owner with another company would.What Is the Process for Licensing a Starbucks?The details of obtaining a Starbucks license are extensive, but the basic outline of how to apply is simple. Here are the steps:Visit the Starbucks website and register yourself as a potential licensee.Complete a formal application.Indicate your preferred business location.Supply the company with your current cash position, along with your assets and liabilities.Add any supplemental information about why your location is particularly appropriate for a licensed Starbucks store.Submit your application and wait to hear back.Obviously, these are simply the first steps in the process. If the company shows interest, you can expect a site visit and a detailed examination of your financials and your business process, along with associated paperwork.A Crack in the SystemWhile Starbucks doesn’t offer any franchises in the U.S., or indeed any part of North America, it does have a limited number of franchise outlets overseas, particularly in the U.K. If you reside overseas and are a successful business owner, there is a chance you may qualify for a Starbucks franchise that way. However, qualification standards are high. In addition to being an owner or high-level manager, generally in the food and beverage industry, you must have liquid assets of at least £500,000 (around $624,200), a stable financial situation and be willing to open numerous locations in a short period of time. In other words, unless you are a wealthy and successful business owner who lives overseas, has extensive experience in the industry and the capital required to open multiple locations, you’re likely out of luck.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money Laura Beck contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much It Costs To Own a Starbucks Franchise]"

And as uncertainty remains, those looking to put money to work are trying to figure out exactly what to buy and what they should avoid. So let's break it all down with Nancy Tengler, Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and Chief Investment Officer.Nancy, it's great to have you here. So you have some stocks for us to buy, some stocks that you're advising to hold-- to avoid at this point. Let's start with one of your buys, Starbucks. What do you like about it?NANCY TENGLER: Yeah, so sometimes, and this is important for your viewers to know, you can get out of a stock for all the right reasons. And ours was there was no management succession. Howard Schultz coming back for the third time, labor problems, China-- they doubled down on China.And we just felt like it was something we'd owned for a very long time. So we got out and pretty much went straight up from there. And so we waited until Laxman, who's the new CEO, reported earnings and gave muted guidance and so the stock sold off.And I just think he did that because that would be a smart thing to do as the new CEO-- not raise guidance precipitously, just wait and then surprise to the upside. So they've got a lot of levers to pull. The labor thing seems to be OK. China's reopened, strong dividend growth. So we stepped back in and we'll continue to add on volatility.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Nancy, Starbucks one name that you like. But the other one that I thought was kind of interesting is your take on Disney here. And I'm curious what this is, whether it's about the valuation of the stock or about the strategy. Because we have seen a lot of restructuring happening since Bob Iger came back in.NANCY TENGLER: Yeah. And I think, Akiko, the fact that he had to come back is a problem. I think there's a lack of shared vision in the company. He was behind the scenes putting pressure on Chapek with the board. And I think that makes me worried about the future of the company.Story continuesThey are in three disparate businesses. One seems to be working at all times. But they're not getting credit for that. So great company, but not a great stock.And then the last thing I'll say is you're not even getting paid to wait, because the dividend was suspended and there's no talk of even adding it back in. So we're on the sidelines.SEANA SMITH: When it comes to another name that you do like, though, Chipotle. And this kind of stuck out to me because we have already seen a massive surge in the stock, even just since the start of the year. Why do you think they're positioned well in this environment?NANCY TENGLER: So one of our investing , themes Seana, is old economy companies that are embracing the digital revolution. And Chipotle pivoted just the right way during COVID. They get $1 million in annual sales from each store on just digital orders alone.So it has a pretty, I'd say, a full valuation. We were buying it during the pandemic, so our acquisition cost was about $500. But it's just-- it's a growth stock that's always had a lofty valuation. They've got pricing power and excellent management.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Nancy, you mentioned pricing power-- I am curious about that one, because the digital strategy and their success has long been documented. They've also been pretty out ahead in terms of those price hikes. And they've sort of been able to play both sides.Consumers still coming along, they are still coming through the stores even at a higher price point.NANCY TENGLER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What is it you think about Chipotle that has allowed them to do that? And is that kind of a strategy that you're likely to see or a strategy that you think other companies have been able to find success in?NANCY TENGLER: Yeah. I think it's brand. I think that's really what it comes down to I mean, the food is good, of course. They're adding ChipotLanes, which makes it more convenient. But it all comes back down to brand.And you could make the same argument about Starbucks. How much are you going to pay-- how much are you going to be willing to pay for that iced latte? I mean, mine the other day was $7.25. And I bought it.So I think that's some of it. Now, that doesn't mean growth isn't going to slow if the consumer gets softer. But eating out, and at that price point, I mean, I'd actually rather pay that much for a burrito than I would for a cup of coffee. So I think they just have a lot of the right elements. And it's clean food, people perceive. And it's good.SEANA SMITH: Nancy, speaking of pricing, a little bit different, though-- we have certainly seen the pricing-- a number of pricing variations when it comes to Tesla, I know one of the plays that you have liked recently. We just heard from Elon Musk yesterday at the annual shareholder meeting. What do you think about how Tesla is positioned now? Because he did warn that the next several months could be a bit challenging here for the company.NANCY TENGLER: So Tesla and Elon right now remind me of Apple when Tim Cook took over. So there was a transition going on in the company. People were underestimating him, for sure-- Tim Cook, that is. And they were worried that it was just a handset company. But it was really about services.And we started buying the stock in 2012 because we liked the services ecosystem story. I think Tesla has the same thing going on and people are overlooking that. I mean, for example, they have a $300 million insurance premium business that no one talks about. So the ecosystem-- they're cutting pricing to draw people into the ecosystem, and that has sustainable earnings growth power in the future.I also think it's kind of interesting that people are bemoaning the decline in their margins. It's still four times or five times Ford's, and they forced Ford to cut EV prices twice this year. So I think him sort of experimenting with advertising-- I don't think that's a sign of weakness. I just think it's smart business.AKIKO FUJITA: So interesting, Nancy, I mean, it sounds like you think there is a whole other lever here to be unlocked when it comes to Tesla. How big of a concern is that distraction part of the conversation? I mean, we know that Twitter now has a new CEO, but Elon Musk has made it pretty clear, I'm still going to try to run both sides.NANCY TENGLER: Yeah. And I'm going to say whatever I want. So we actually picked up the stock in January. We'd owned it years ago, kind of underestimated him when he was going through all the problems with management, didn't have an independent board of directors. And remember, he was on the Joe Rogan show-- I don't need to finish that sentence.So we felt like at that point, it was kind of gambling for our clients, because there was no management succession. Now, he's got one of the best CFOs in the country, I think. And he has hired, like, as everyone requested, he has hired a woman to take over the company, Twitter, that is.And so for us, it just feels like he's marching at his own pace, as he always does. But I don't think the distraction factor is the same with him as it might be with other CEOs. And so we were beneficiaries of people selling the stock, and he selling the stock at the end of last year, because we picked it up in early January in the low 100s. So we're pretty happy with our investments so far.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and you should be given the returns that we've seen since the start of the year. Nancy Tengler, great to have you. Thanks so much.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund and recent developments, and go directly to read Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks. Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975. Today, it is one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds due to its distinctive approach to investing. Dalio’s investment philosophy emphasizes radical transparency, meritocracy, and the importance of understanding and managing risk. Dalio's approach combines macroeconomic analysis with fundamental research to identify investment opportunities and manage portfolio risk. Under Dalio's leadership, Bridgewater Associates has achieved remarkable success and has been recognized as one of the top-performing hedge funds in the world. The firm manages assets for a wide range of clients, including institutional investors, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of Bridgewater Associates, as Dalio gave up control of the hedge fund to a new generation of investors in 2022. However, he has kept his seat on the firm’s board. Following his decision to retire, Dalio has recently announced to set up his family office branch in Abu Dhabi, as reported by Bloomberg.  Previously, he had a business relationship with Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).As an influential investor and market commentator, Dalio often provides his perspectives on various economic topics and trends through interviews, public speeches, and his writings. The recent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failure has created a new uncertain environment across the stock market and Dalio has also shared his insights on this matter. In his interview with Business Insider, he shared that this bank fallout would have larger implications for the stock market in the coming years. Dalio has also given a skeptical outlook for the market. Here are some comments from the billionaire investor:Story continues“Markets will see more borrowing in the coming years as the federal government grapples with massive budget deficits, he said. In order to fill the deficit hole, the government must borrow money by selling debt, such as US Treasurys, but debt investors need to have a high enough real return.”As of the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of $16.3 billion, down from $18.3 billion in the last quarter. The hedge fund had widely invested in dividend stocks such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). In this article, we will further discuss the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio.Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 12 Dividend Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology:For this list, we selected top dividend-paying stocks from the latest 13F portfolio of Bridgewater, where Dalio remains a mentor, board member, and investor. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.12. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $155,760,825 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.98%Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is an Illinois-based multinational food company that also produces snacks and beverages. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.2 million shares in the company, worth over $155.7 million. The company represented 0.95% of the firm's 13F portfolio. It is among the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio alongside some other dividend stocks like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.385 per share for a dividend yield of 1.98%, as of May 17. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past nine years.Mizuho appreciated the Q1 upside and stronger volume of Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and raised its price target on the stock to $86 in May. The firm also maintained a Buy rating on MDLZ.At the end of December 2022, 46 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), compared with 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $1.5 billion.Here’s what Coho Partners said about Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”11. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $183,825,849 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 3.61%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare and pharmacy company that is one of the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.605 per share with a dividend yield of 3.61%, as of May 17. It has raised its dividend for the past two years in a row.In May, Wells Fargo maintained an Equal Weight rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with a $76 price target. The firm mentioned that the company's recent quarterly earnings were modestly ahead of expectations.At the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.4 million shares, with a total value of over $183.8 million. The hedge fund has been investing in the company since the third quarter of 2012. During the most recent quarter, the firm reduced its position in the company by 10%, which represented 1.12% of its 13F portfolio.Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database shows that 70 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), up from 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of $2.13 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”10. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $218,590,165 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.86%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and healthcare company. It holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, having raised its payouts for 51 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.86%, as of May 17. It is among the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio.Bridgewater Associates first initiated its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) during the fourth quarter of 2010 with shares worth over $4.8 million. In the most recent quarter, the hedge fund owned ABT stakes worth nearly $218.6 million. The company accounted for 1.33% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Appreciating the strong earnings and organic growth of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the most recent quarter, Street analysts gave positive ratings to the stock. In April, both UBS and Barclays raised their price targets on the stock to $130 and $127, respectively.At the end of December 2022, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), worth collectively $3.2 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $223,390,052 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 0.78%During the first quarter of 2023, Bridgewater Associates boosted its position in Visa by 19%, ending the quarter with stakes worth $223.4 million. The company made up 1.36% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has been rewarding shareholders with 16 years of consecutive dividend growth. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share for a dividend yield of 0.78%, as of May 17.As per Insider Monkey's database, 177 hedge funds owned stakes in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in Q4 2022, up from 165 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $26.4 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $259,065,131 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 2.01%Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Washington-based multinational chain of coffeehouses that also specializes in a wide range of other beverages. In May, Wells Fargo raised its price target on the stock to $125 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's impressive quarterly earnings.On April 3, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 12 years. The stock's dividend yield on May 17 came in at 2.01%.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio. At the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.4 million shares in the company, worth roughly $260 million. The company represented 1.58% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a popular stock among hedge funds in Q4 2022, according to Insider Monkey's database. 61 hedge funds owned stakes in the company in Q4, up from 54 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes stood at over $2.65 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $393,706,835 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.52%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) owns grocery stores and department stores across the country. In 2023, the company achieved its Dividend King status after raising its payouts for 50 consecutive years.

(NYSE:WMT) to $155 in May and kept a Neutral rating on the shares, highlighting the company's overall performance.Bridgewater Associates initiated its position in Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT), down from 68 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.8 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $427,957,112 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 0.82%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American big-box retail company.

(NYSE:MRK).As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2022 database, 66 hedge funds owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), with a total value of $3.4 billion.Madison Funds mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 10 Stocks12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy10 Best Gold Royalty Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

XYL is benefiting from strong backlogs, owing to underlying demand. Also, due to the essential nature of the business, the company’s demand remains robust. Pricing actions to mitigate cost inflation are supporting the bottom line. Solid global demand across end markets also bodes well for the company.Effective price realization and strength in both utility and industrial end markets are supporting XYL’s Water Infrastructure segment. The Applied Water segment is gaining from commercial and industrial end markets. Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is benefiting from a robust utility end market, primarily in the United States, due to strong backlog execution. Also, strong price realization and improvement in chip supply bode well.Xylem’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are noteworthy. In 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $217 million, up 6.9% year over year. In the first three months of 2023, it paid out dividends worth $60 million, up 9.1% year over year. The company bought back shares worth $52 million in 2022 and $8 million in the first three months of 2023. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.However, Xylem has been experiencing adverse impacts of cost inflation for a while. In the first three months of 2023, the company’s cost of revenues increased 12.1% year over year, while selling, general and administrative expenses rose 16.5%. High raw material, labor, freight and overhead costs are pushing up the costs of sales. Escalating costs pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. Additionally, higher strategic investments might dent margin performance.XYL’s extensive presence across international markets and its operations are subject to risks associated with unfavorable movement in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues. For 2023, the company expects a 5% decrease in currency rate, which might impact revenues by $150 million and earnings by 16 cents per share.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 27.9, compared with the industry’s 15.3% increase.Stocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted some top-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector.Ingersoll Rand Inc.

(Operator Instructions). Today's call will last 1 hour. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trey Campbell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Trey CampbellThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chair and CEO of Synopsys; and Shelagh Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on our website at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.Story continuesAart J. de GeusGood afternoon. We delivered excellent results in the second quarter, exceeding all our guidance targets while reaching another quarterly revenue record. Revenue of $1.395 billion was above the high end of our guidance range with non-GAAP operating margin at 33.3%. GAAP earnings per share was $1.76, while non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our target range at $2.54. We generated $703 million of operating cash flow and increased our backlog to $7.3 billion. The market is playing out much as we expected when we planned the year. Demand is weaker for semiconductors overall, with consumer end markets most impacted. Despite choppy macroeconomic conditions, customers continue to prioritize R&amp;D for new chip designs so that they emerge stronger when demand accelerates. The transition to Smart Everything is well underway and will drive significant long-term growth for semiconductors and outsized contribution for us. Against this backdrop, we planned and are executing accordingly. Based on continued strong design activity and high confidence in our business, we are raising our full year revenue guidance range to between $5.79 billion and $5.83 billion. We're increasing our year-over-year non-GAAP ops margin improvement expectation to 150 basis points, up approximately 0.5 point versus prior guidance. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range to between $10.77 and $10.84. Shelagh will discuss the financials in more detail. Let me give some color for the quarter. In March, we held SNUG, our yearly Synopsys Users Group Conference in Silicon Valley. Including its follow-on road shows, we bring together over 12,000 passionate design engineers around our common focus of driving innovation in chip and system design. Live after 3 years of COVID, the conference was fantastically engaging. Our audience fully recognized how design parameters and product requirements have become exponentially more complex and interwoven accelerated by the breakthroughs of multi-die designs. Simultaneously, the end market hunger for Smart Everything puts huge pressure on increasing performance per watt to the limit. And on top of that, security and safety are now becoming mandatory everywhere. Synopsys' vision and mission of smart, secure and safe thus sets both a high bar and foreshadows great opportunities for our customers and our company. Users told me though that while system complexities are growing exponentially, design resources are not. Design productivity thus requires a catalytic step function change in our approach. To us, this inflection comes from AI. We are embedding AI in everything we do. We have made world-class advance in design flow automation, and our customers are now adopting Synopsys AI on production designs at a remarkable rate. This is not by accident. Twelve years ago, we called out a vision of Smart Everything, unleashed by the intersection of big data and machine learning. Since then, we applied ML everywhere on our product offering. In 2017, we decided to harness AI for entire design sub flows and began investing in DSO.ai where DSO stands for design space optimization. We are rapidly progressed from prototype to customer validation of AI-driven results in 2019, recognized by the Aspen core IEEE World Electronics Achievement award for Innovative Product of the Year in 2020. The following year, at the 2021 Hot Chips conference, we unveiled our pioneering AI journey and road map, showcased by a slew of remarkable results. DSO.ai delivered not only better speed and power on large and complex design blocks, but it did so in a fraction of the time, meaning month down 2 weeks, while requiring fewer, less specialized designers. This did not go unnoticed as it had been validated weeks earlier by Samsung, an early partner, announcing the world's first AI-driven commercial tape-out with DSO.ai. By the end of 2022, adoption, including 9 of the top 10 semiconductor vendors have moved forward at great speed with 100 AI-driven commercial tape-outs. Today, the tally is well over 200 and continues to increase at a very fast clip as the industry broadly adopts AI for design from Synopsys. But we have not set still. At SNUG, we unveiled the industry's first full stack AI-driven EDA suite, sydnopsys.ai. Specifically, in parallel to second-generation advances in DSO.ai we announced VSO.ai, which stands for verification space optimization; and TSO.ai, test space optimization. In addition, we are extending AI across the design stack to include analog design and manufacturing. Partners in the announcement included NVIDIA, TSMC, MediaTek, Renesas and IBM Research, all providing stunning use cases of the rapid progress and criticality of Synopsys.ai to deliver their breakthrough results. As an example, Renesas achieved up to 10x improvement in reducing functional coverage holes and up to 30% increase in verification productivity (sic) [IP verification productivity].This is substantial progress, yet is still only the beginning of our AI journey. The road map of optimizing, automating and generative AI use cases is wide open to deliver productivity breakthroughs for years to come. Turning now to our segment results. Let me start with Design Automation, which accounts for roughly 65% of Synopsys' revenue. Design Automation had a very strong quarter with robust order and revenue growth. Let me lead off by recognizing the 1-year anniversary of Synopsys cloud, the industry's first and only SaaS solution that provides customers with a completely browser-based experience, optimized compute and preconfigured EDA flows. We're seeing excellent momentum as customers gain significant time-to-market advantages with the industry's only cloud-optimized pay-per-use business model, providing on-demand tool access with cloud scale elasticity. In the past year, we have doubled our customer base every quarter this year with the SaaS model accounting for 70% of users. Market adoption of our Fusion Compiler continues to grow across vertical segments and manufacturing nodes. This quarter, we won many major designs, including wins at 2 top Asian semiconductor companies and a leading high-performance computing company. Fusion Compiler is leading advanced 3-nanometer node tape-outs, with roughly 2/3 of designs exclusively using Synopsys flows. We continue to drive our Design Automation leadership. In Q2, we announced a collaboration with TSMC to deliver digital and custom-designed EDA flows on their most advanced 2-nanometer process node. Our full EDA stack, complemented with the timeliness of IP offering, allows designers to jump start their 2-nanometer designs, differentiate their SoCs and accelerate their time to market. Expanding from digital, we continue to grow and displays competition in the custom design market. We earned 8 new design wins in Q2, giving us 23 wins year-to-date. We also benefit from a growing pipeline of top customers using Synopsys for advanced node retargeting. Transitioning to multi-die chip design, leading the industry's transformation from monolithic SoCs to multi-die systems with a comprehensive and scalable solution for fast heterogeneous integration. In Q2, we deployed our multi-die VCS functional verification at a leading U.S. high-performance computing customer, delivering more than 2x faster turnaround time. We also announced our collaboration with TSMC and ANSYS for multi-die system design and manufacturing providing the industry's most comprehensive EDA and IP solutions on TSMC's advanced process technologies. We've often talked about the unbounded demands for verification. The need for verification acceleration is unrelenting. Our customers want more, more throughput, more capacity and more energy efficiency, all with lower total cost of ownership. This quarter, we announced ZeBu Server 5, the industry's first emulation system with unmatched capacity to enable electronic digital twins of advanced SoCs. ZeBu Server 5 delivers this with 2x higher throughput and 2x lower energy usage compared to our previous generation. We are seeing pull from a broad range of semiconductor system and hyperscaler companies with exceptional adoption results. One large semiconductor company saw ZeBu Server 5 deliver a 40% reduction in compile times on multiple large designs. Finally, I want to highlight a breakthrough on the manufacturing front that NVIDIA announced at its March GTC conference. Currently lithography is nearing the limits of what physics makes possible. Our collaboration with NVIDIA remedies this by running Synopsys' OPC, optical proximity correction software, on NVIDIA's computational lithography platform named cuLitho.Our collaboration massively reduces compute time from literally weeks to days. Now let's move to Design IP, which is roughly 25% of our revenue. This quarter, we're celebrating 25 years from being in the IP business. Starting with simple building blocks and interfaces then, we now provide entire IP subsystems. Today, we have over 7,500 IP components supporting 340 process technologies, all driven by the same smart, secure and safe innovation imperative. Momentum in the business is very strong with demand fueled by high-performance computing, automotive and mobile applications where Smart Everything devices need high speed and secure connectivity increasingly architected for multi-die systems. These systems drive the need for state-of-the-art high-speed die-to-die interfaces, led by UCIe or Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express, which is rapidly becoming the industry standard. We continue to build technical leadership in advanced nodes. In Q2, we received outstanding silicon results on our 224 gig PHY IP already demonstrated at multiple conferences. We're also achieving excellent silicon results and customer engagements on the advanced 3-nanometer process across multiple IP products, including our high-speed interfaces and foundation IP. Third, the Software Integrity segment, which represents around 10% of our revenue. Another milestone here as well as we just passed the $500 million mark in trailing 12-month revenue. The imperative for security and quality in software is vital. Today, every meaningful business is the Software business. Our solutions help companies improve and manage security and quality vectors across a broad set of vertical end markets. While this part of our business is the most affected by the challenging macro environment, we delivered solid growth with notable wins across vertical segments, including technology, financials, health care and telecommunications. We also continue to see most of this segment's revenue driven by customers adopting 2 or more of our solutions as they consolidate providers for efficiency and economics. One last closing point. This week, we released our 2022 ESG report. Throughout this call, I've highlighted the privilege of delivering world-changing technology. For Synopsys, this starts with a commitment to maximize our positive impact and to use our influence to drive broad-based change. I encourage you to read our full report at synopsys.com. In summary, we have excellent Q2 financial results and operational execution, growing confidence in the second half of the year. We're raising our guidance for full year revenue to between $5.79 and $5.83 billion -- sorry, the cents was mistaken here. We now expect to improve full year non-GAAP op margin by 150 basis points versus last year. We are raising our year-over-year non-GAAP earnings per share growth expectation to 21% to 22%. We have a resilient business model, uncommon in most software companies. Despite expected macroeconomic headwinds throughout the year, our customers continue to prioritize investments in the chips, systems and security that will position them for future growth. As you heard, we continue to invest in advanced technologies, multi-die design solutions, state-of-the-art IP and the leading-edge EDA AI-driven suite to make this decade of smart, secure and safe products happen. I would like to thank our employees and our partners for their dedication and passion that makes this possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Shelagh.Shelagh GlaserThank you, Aart. Q2 was a record revenue quarter, and we delivered revenue and EPS above the high end of our guidance range. Our strong results are driven by our execution and leadership position across our segments, robust chip and system design activity despite macro choppiness and a resilient, stable time-based business model with $7.3 billion in noncancelable backlog. We remain confident in our business, and as a result, we are raising our full year targets for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin improvement and EPS. I'll now review our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $1.395 billion. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.108 billion. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $930 million resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 33.3%. GAAP earnings per share were $1.76, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.54. Now on to our segments. Design Automation segment revenue was $928 million, up 13%, driven by continued strength in both EDA software and hardware. Design Automation adjusted operating margin was 38.8%. Design IP segment revenue was $335 million down 4% due to a tough compare to Q2 '22, which was an exceptionally strong IP quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 25.8%. Software Integrity revenue was $132 million, up 17% and adjusted operating margin was 13.9%. Despite some macro impact on this segment, we continue to expect Software Integrity revenue growth of 15% to 20% with expanding adjusted operating margin for 2023. Turning to cash. We generated $703 million in operating cash flow, and we used $300 million of our cash for stock buybacks. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion and total debt of $20 million. Now to guidance. For fiscal year 2023, the full year targets are: revenue of $5.79 billion to $5.83 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $4.520 billion and $4.565 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.79 billion and $3.82 billion, resulting in non-GAAP margin improvement of 150 basis points; non-GAAP tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $7.44 to $7.60 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $10.77 to $10.84 per share; cash flow from operations of approximately $1.65 billion. Now to targets for the third quarter: revenue between $1.465 billion and $1.495 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $1.143 billion and $1.163 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $970 million and $980 million; GAAP earnings of $1.88 to $1.99 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $2.70 and $2.75 per share. In conclusion, we are confident in achieving revenue growth of 14% to 15%, 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement and 21% to 22% non-GAAP earnings growth in 2023. Our strong execution reflects our leadership position across our segments, robust design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and the stability and resiliency of our time-based business model. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan SurCongratulations on a well-executed quarter. We do our best to try and track chip design activity primarily with the large ASIC semiconductor companies that are helping the large hyperscalers and systems companies sort of codesign their custom chips because they're sort of a good proxy for overall leading-edge chip design activity, right? And from what we can tell, overall chip design starts have accelerated just over the past few months, given this AI arms race among the cloud and hyperscalers. So they all want to bring their silicon solutions to the market sooner rather than later. Are you guys seeing the step up in acceleration in design activity as well? And how is this acceleration manifesting itself in terms of upcoming renewals? And just your confidence on full year outlook and continued strong growth into next year?Aart J. de GeusWell, first, the answer is absolutely yes. And it's not a surprise. In general, even when there are economic downturns, the semiconductor industry tends to invest strongly in chip design so that when the downturn fades away, they have differentiation because the worst is to miss an upturn because that's where most of the money is made. In this case, there's an additional substantial driver. And you've seen it with all the excitement, I would say, 5% (inaudible) and 95%, absolutely great understanding of the impact of what this will have on the world, where every vertical market is now committed to Smart Everything. Now the question is how quickly can they become smart? And they quickly discover that, well, the software is fantastic, the computation requirements of that software are fantastic, too. And so the race is on for more chips, faster chips and most importantly, chips where you can get high output at low power. And so this plays into the core competencies that Synopsys has. And -- because simultaneously, there is a shortage of top designers, the productivity enhancements that we can bring about with our own AI have a material impact on that.Harlan SurAnd then as the team had anticipated on the last earnings call, you're demonstrating it with your guide on this call, right, you've seen a strong step-up in the second half. I think it's roughly about 11% half-on-half growth. And on a year-over-year basis, I think second half is going to be up like 20% plus. I know the team talked about second half weighting on renewal activity and also more IP consumption given the timing of some of your customers' design programs. IP was down slightly year-over-year in the first half. Is the team still anticipating half-to-half and year-over-year step up in IP for the second half?Aart J. de GeusYes. I think in hindsight, I think we have mapped out the year pretty well. And you have to always map it out by also looking at the previous year, which was exceptional in its other directivity. It had very big growth early on and then less growth in the second half. Now we're back to essentially a normal year where you move left to right and bottom to up on an ongoing basis. And one of the reasons that we were able to map it pretty well is because we have a reasonable understanding of what designs are coming, what renewals, but also what IP will be pulled during the year from the needs of the different projects. So you can never quite forecast the future exactly, and so we may have been careful. But I think we had actually mapped pretty well, and we have a high degree of confidence on the numbers that we're guiding you to.Shelagh GlaserYes. And I would just add, Harlan, I mean our teams are deeply embedded in the design team. So we have a really good understanding of where they are in terms of their needs from us, specifically on the IP side, which is set for a strong second half, which is traditional like Aart said.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.Joseph D. VruwinkGreat. I guess I'll start. At this point, 2 of your peers have mentioned the expectation for some larger software renewals coming through in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering if maybe that commentary is representative of what might just be a stronger new business environment for the industry in the second half of the year and if you're seeing that? And then kind of related to the renewal conversation, given the backlog increased sequentially, I would imagine you're seeing some good renewals come through. Is the nature of what your customers are looking for changing at all? And I guess, embedded in the question is whether the AI products are increasingly being incorporated in the bigger renewals?Aart J. de GeusWell, let me work backwards on that one. Yes, AI is absolutely prominent in many transactions because either people have already very good experience in just racing to implement it in many more chips or use it on many more chips or they have heard from others and are racing to now look at how they can use it. At the same time, I would say that there's no alignment in big renewals across the industry. They happen whenever they happen for each one of the individual companies. But I would say that there are evolutions in industry. And the evolutions are that companies that in the past were sort of investing in chip design because they felt it was going to be important in the future. Now suddenly are realizing it has big impact on their future because they have to make architectural decisions, because they're certainly discovering that they do have a lot of data to do things with. And I'm talking about hyperscalers or big system design companies. Or then the semiconductor design companies that have this nonstop pressure from their customers, give me way more compute for less power and maybe roughly the same cost. And those are pressures that are challenging, but also exciting. So I would think that the industry is overall notwithstanding ups and downs of volumes is actually quite healthy and looking at the coming decade of great opportunities given the state of the art of the software demand.Joseph D. VruwinkOkay. That's great. And then a question on your verification hardware business. As I think about your nonrecurring revenues and the growth there over time. I mean you've sustained just a very high CAGR in that business. And yet when I think about the demand for verification, sometimes it's been in GEO's that are building out a semiconductor supply chain. Sometimes it's new companies, I think about like China being down year-on-year and yet, it looked like your hardware business grew. So is the nature of growth in your verification business maybe coming from different sources than might have been the case in years past?Aart J. de GeusWell, I would say that it has broadened. A number of years ago, only very few companies would use hardware systems and verification, they would use it quite massively. But now many companies are doing that. And actually, there are 2 very different reasons: one is to use the verification assistance or the hardware to essentially accelerate tasks that used to do, which is verify the functionality of chips. We have long entered a different space with Synopsys, by being at the heart of the intersection between software and hardware. And there, the objective is essentially to mimic the hardware on machine or partially on a machine so that people can run the software to not only check if the hardware works, but just as importantly, how good is the software. And even more interestingly is can you optimize the software so that you use less energy in the computation. In other words, there's an interaction between hardware and software, that is a great place to optimize the actual computational costs. And so as you can imagine, running real software on machines that mimic the very chips you don't have yet is very complex. And we're doing very well with that. And the Server 5 that we just announced is yet another example of a big piece, all around the space of what we would call electronic digital twinning, which is created an artificial world on a computer and be able to exercise the real world on it to see what the results will look like.Shelagh GlaserYes. And I would just share, we had shared that 2022 was a record hardware year. We expect '23 to be another record hardware year. So as Aart said, the demand is very strong across our customer base.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc.Jason Vincent CelinoAart, I appreciate all your comments about mapping the year appropriately and seeing fitting the pattern that you had planned. But when I look at the quarter, the beat was still nice and suggest that something must have come in better than expected. Can you just elaborate where you exactly saw the strength and the upside?Aart J. de GeusWell, it's always hard to say if it's better than expected of which -- we just worked harder at it. But the fact is I think we executed well. We have a number of key people in our management team that have been new to the company in the last year, and we are making really excellent progress of scaling Synopsys for the ability to work at this level. But simultaneously, I think that the trust built up with the customers and the breakthroughs and technologies that we've had in the last few years really bodes well going forward. And so I've plenty highlighted, I think, the AI in the preamble. But I'd like to also mention the fact that multi-die is really in many ways, the technology answer for a few additional decades of what I'd like to call SysMoore. So systemic complexity and Moore's Law, still an exponential ambition, but much more complex with multiple chips. And we are very well engaged with that. It is quite complex to do. And these are good things for us to deliver.Jason Vincent CelinoOkay. Perfect. And then I did have an AI question, but it's actually for your security business. We've seen some examples of AI being used to write code and even test and (inaudible). How do you think this may augment or evolve processes for developers going forward?Aart J. de GeusI think what we're seeing with AI that it will augment everything. Now not all the everything are created equal, right? So you need to have understanding of any of the fields or the disciplines to use AI well, but the ability to look at data from many different perspectives and many different interconnections opens the door to all kinds of advances. And so it shouldn't be surprising that Synopsys is well invested in many different explorations. And that includes the SIG area, that includes every aspect of the company. But it's also exciting to see that with the approaches that we have taken that require a very high degree of accuracy, we've been successful. And so just to make a distinction, generative AI can do wonders with enormous amount of data, but it is not necessarily always correct. We cannot afford that. A single transistor doesn't work, the whole system doesn't work. And so we're in a class of AI that required actually very rigorous computation. And -- but all of this is wide open. So it's an exciting time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.Gary Wade MobleyI wanted to ask about how transformational AI can be for the core EDA market. And the angle I'm taking here is that clearly, the core EDA market has grown faster than chip designers. And that really is driven by efficiency. That's what the E in EDA stands for, right? And so my question is, how does AI further enhance the automation and chip design? How do you share with your customer savings on that? Could you just give us a sense of sort of the magnitude of the inflationary tailwind on a per seat license basis? Or maybe from a different perspective, how it transforms the growth rate of the core EDA market?Aart J. de GeusWell, it's only to say how it transforms the market because we are, I think, at the beginning of a decade of impact. It is not early to clarify the impact it already has. And for the very few of you that actually remember the beginning of Synopsys, we started in an era where automation was just beginning. And the synthesis at that time was certainly out of nowhere ed in a matter of hours to do something that designers took many, many weeks to do. And in many ways, the AI that we have right now on entire subflows does exactly the same. And the reaction at that time by, I want to say, 5% of the designers, oh, you're taking my job away. But the other 95% said, oh, give it to me faster because now I can do so many new things. And by the way, the demand for gates will not stop. It will double. That was enormous. You could use exactly the same words today. Many companies and designers see that this impacts how they will be able to design very complex things where their own ingenuity greatly matters. But at the same time, gets multiplied with this capability to see many dimensions and many enormous amount of data all at the same time. So I think it is profoundly transformational. And we are seeing the benefit of that. And the benefit manifest itself through much of our tool chain because people tend to want to have a complete solution from Synopsys for precisely these capabilities.Gary Wade MobleyAnd this may be a question more for Shelagh. But I appreciate the fact that your first half IP business is they've seen the tough year-ago comp and thus the minor increase -- or excuse me, decrease in the revenue. But what's driving the profitability headwind? If I'm not mistaken, there's a 10 to 12 percentage point degradation in the op margin. Is that mix related? Or are there some other factors factoring in there?Shelagh GlaserSo thanks for the question, Gary. Our IP business is super lumpy. And the way I kind of think about the IP business is we're always building new IPs. Aart talked about us having greater than 7,500 IPs on 340 process nodes. So we're constantly building and innovating new IPs, but then the customer pull down is based on when their design schedules are. So you're going to tend to see a lumpy operating margin. Over time, that operating margin is slightly below the corporate average. That's really the way we're managing it. But we'll see some variations quarter-on-quarter because we're not changing our resourcing because we've got to continue on that race to deliver those IP blocks, but the customer pull downs are really based on when their design need is.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.Vivek AryaAart, you mentioned the adoption of multi-die designs. And I'm curious, what percentage of chip design starts do you think are in this multi-die architecture? And where do you see that going? And is there a way to quantify the benefit to Synopsys in that position?Aart J. de GeusWe're just at the beginning because -- just at the beginning at the same time, we track over 100 designs and multi-die is not simple design. So these are sophisticated investments. But what is very clear is that the adoption is accelerating, but more importantly is the notion that this is where the future is going. And as with any of these changes, some of the most invested parties move first and move aggressively. And then others follow when the risk declines, the cost equation becomes better. But the movement is moving fast forward. And from an understanding of the needs, we understand very well that a lot of the things that people want to do in specifically AI-related computation is only possible if they have more capabilities, i.e., way more chips working very closely together. A great example for that is actually automotive where a number of companies are looking at what is the architecture that they need in order to supply, let's say, Level 4 autonomous driving by roughly the end of this decade. And it's substantial. And it also takes a substantial amount of power to do all that computation. And that is one of the reasons that many are looking at doing their own solutions or teaming up with a few companies to do dedicated solutions for their car brand.Vivek AryaAnd for my follow-up, maybe one for Shelagh on operating margin expansion. So you mentioned you're raising the target 250 basis points. When I look over the last few years, I know your former target is to expand it by 100 basis points. But I think on an average, it's been over 250 basis points for the last several years, if my model is right. So first part of the question is what is helping the expansion this year? Is it -- sales are doing better, costs are under control? So what's the driver? And then what keeps them from expanding the way you have been able to expand over the last few years?Shelagh GlaserWell, I would start with we're very committed to both short-term and long-term margin expansion. And short term, what's driving it is we're putting in some more rigorous financial control. So as we work through these great opportunities that Aart painted for us, how do we make sure that we properly scale ourselves. So that's really the improvement that we're putting forward the greater than 150 basis points, and we're committed to continuing to long-term improve margin.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Charles Shi with Needham.Yu ShiSo Aart, maybe first off, I want to ask a long-term question related to generative AI, not to your products, but to your customers' products. Looks like with all the news flows of the last quarter, the accelerated hardware right now seems to be converging to a NVIDIA GPUs. But I remember, over the past few years, I mean, at least for EDA industry, system companies designing on their own AI accelerators, AI start-ups, innovating in AI hardware has been a big driver for EDA. So my question is -- and maybe I'm just picking one very specific hardware AI accelerator here, but is the trend towards customer accelerators reversing? Or is it not quite reversing, but will likely continue? How do we think about what's going on in the trend there?Aart J. de GeusIt's a race of all of the above. And kudos to NVIDIA to have positioned themselves so well and be so unbelievably technically competent. At the same time, the very fact that there is such an interest and such an ambition on many parties to do well, some that have the ability themselves to develop acceleration for AI will absolutely do so. Others will team up, and yet others will really work well with NVIDIA. So in general, when you have a new field that gets a lot of attention, you also get a lot of new innovation and new investments. And so I foresee that we will continue to see that moving forward at a pretty rapid clip because the demand is so high. Now underneath all of this, there are some very challenging problems. And so while the results that we've seen are truly exciting, figuring out some of the software solutions to make sure that the results are actually truthful, that you can actually protect the intellectual property. What was used, what's open, what's available, what's illegal, I mean there's a lot of technical questions that will demand even more compute. Simultaneously, because these systems are very powerful, the security and the safety will also be paramount. And I'd like to highlight that because we touch this at multiple places. We touch it obviously top-down through the software via our SIG side of the company, the Software Integrity Group. But we also touch it bottom up by virtue of putting mechanism in chips that help encrypt the data, provide root of trust, a unique identification, et cetera. And that's built into the IP and the design flows. So there's a lot of opportunity. Whenever the world changes, there's opportunity, and it changes at a very rapid pace. And that's why SysMoore, the exponential part of Moore's Law, is very much alive and well.Yu ShiMaybe the next follow-up. On the second half acceleration, what -- can you kind of provide a little bit more color on what are the drivers? I think you mentioned about the better visibility into the IP drawdowns in the second half, but is that the majority of the drivers? And do you -- shall we expect that the EDA revenue run rate go higher into second half? Because I kind of noted that in fiscal second quarter, your EDA revenue actually broke the $900 million mark. By the way, congratulations on that. But -- so we expect that to trend higher into the second half?Aart J. de GeusWell, in order to deliver the results that we're guiding you to, you need to really see growth everywhere. And I think Shelagh already stated that IP is truly very lumpy. And I forget the exact comparison versus a year ago, but IP definitely has to contribute and will contribute in the second half to get to the numbers. But EDA is, of course, more ratable. And so there, we have a good assessment of the situation. So fundamentally, I think all cylinders will do well in the second half.Shelagh GlaserYes. And I mean, obviously, the trend of first half, second half is more traditionally what we see. Last year was a little bit unusual and then a very balanced first half and second half. But we do expect growth across the businesses, and we do expect particular growth in our IP business.OperatorYou next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin.Jay VleeschhouwerAart, for you first, it was interesting to hear you speak about the extent of production deployments of AI so far in terms of your software as compared to what might have been perhaps more ad hoc or piloting or conservative implementation to this point, since historically, EDA customers are somewhat conservative in terms of how quickly they adopt new technology. The question for you is as that is occurring, what effect are you seeing or what the fact you expect in terms of your services revenue? You had an unusually flat sequential comp in terms of services. But you have been, on the other hand, investing substantially in the (inaudible) capacity. So maybe talk about that relationship? And then I have a follow-up.Aart J. de GeusWell, the adoption rate, I think, is the result of: a, a great opportunity space for our customers to come out with new products, the need to have faster products; secondly, the fact that very early on in our development, and I gave you sort of the 5-year time line for that, we're able to get good results. Good results was equivalent to what the traditional more human-driven design flow would do. And that's sort of an imperative. If you don't do that, people like automation, but they don't like to be not competitive. And after that, we were able to accelerate it substantially. And then the very productivity angle came in. And I would argue that probably the activity angle has been the singular most impressive in terms of the ability to move this forward. Now from a service point of view, our own teams have the ability to use all of these tools. Obviously, they have in-house teaching, so to speak. We don't discuss specifically our service business. But what is clear is that customers count on us to what I like to call, make it all work, which is the complexity of so many dimensions of multiple chips, of multiple challenges between hardware and software, between energy and thermal impact, between the utilization of certain technologies versus others. These are all things where we are a team with the customer. We have so many people of Synopsys, be it in service or in support, that are integral to the design teams of our customers. It's a privilege to be sort of in the kitchen. And in the kitchen, hopefully, they're doing a good job, including using our most advanced oven, so to speak, the AI oven here, right? So the teamwork component in the industry has grown. And that -- we predicted that quite a while ago. And many of you have heard me say that in English, we often use the term our success is the sum of our efforts. It's not. It's the product, single zero, everybody gets 0. And this applies to individual teams, but it also applies to the relationship between companies. And that's why it's exciting to be part of this wave of companies plotting entirely new horizons for themselves and be privileged to be part of it.Jay VleeschhouwerAs a follow-up, there have been a number of questions about the second half. When we look at your inventories, which, of course, is related to your hardware business, there was a substantial sequential increase to a record level to just over $0.25 billion. How quickly do you think you'll be able to convert that into shipment? I assume you've got a pretty substantial pipeline now for emulation and prototyping behind that inventory number. So is -- are you expecting to convert that in the second half and thereby drive hardware revenue?Shelagh GlaserSo we do expect this to be another record revenue year, and we're actually grateful to be able to build some inventory because we hadn't been able to build considerable inventory with some of the supply line destruction. So we're going to be able to service our customers, and we're really excited about that. So yes, you did see a big build of about 14%. (inaudible) And that's really so we can satisfy our customers' demand.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.Joshua Alexander TiltonMy first one, Aart, you might have alluded to it a little bit, but I kind of just want to ask it more clearly. Outside of all the productivity benefits that you're talking to -- from AI, do you expect these new AI tools or capabilities to make it more likely for a customer to want to choose a full flow from Synopsys versus maybe in the past where they might have put that flow together from numerous products from numerous vendors?Aart J. de GeusAbsolutely. And there's a very good reason for that, which is that the tools have been optimized now to work in concert with each other. So this is not some individual musician, right? This is a choir that has to sing together in tune. And I alluded to the fact earlier that in contrast to many other AI applications where the outcome can be in the ballpark and be very useful. We cannot be in the ballpark. We have to be meticulously correct. And so many of our tools are actually specialized and best-in-class in verifying timing, power, layout ability, correctness. And so these are absolute necessity to make this work. And I think as we move to more and more designs, this is going to be true in a broader set of tasks and a (inaudible) of obstruction. And so this is, by the way, why we have created Synopsys.ai, which is essentially a suite of tools working in different areas. And so the stream that we've highlighted is design. And in simple terms, design is (inaudible) create it and make it as small as possible, as fast as possible as low power as possible. But just as important, some would say even more important is verification, which is does it actually do the function that it's supposed to do. Does it multiply 2 and 3 and not get 5, but get 6, right? You have to be absolutely correct. And then test is yet another aspect that is the whole, does it still work? And does it work well after you manufacture it because a number of things can go wrong there as well. And so broadening these capabilities on top of a set of tools that continually optimize individually, but also as a team, if I can call it that, is one of the key reasons why I think we're doing so well.Joshua Alexander TiltonSuper helpful. And then just for my follow-up, it has been kind of a tough go for some of the pure-play security names this quarter so far. SIG revenue growth is obviously pretty fantastic in the quarter, but it's kind of a lagging indicator. Can you just maybe talk to how the SIG bookings have been trending? And maybe just what gives you confidence that you can continue to sustain that growth in SIG that you're seeing today throughout the rest of the year?Aart J. de GeusWell, we don't disclose bookings, but we did say that there is a headwind that we have seen in that business, mostly viewed by virtue of people delaying some purchases or having more level of signature that are needed. And that should not be a surprise because things like security, you can always argue are super important, but they're rarely urgent until the next day. And so over time, we expect that to rectify itself because the sum total of the entire product base is highly dependent on actually the security of every layer. And while SIG for us is still, I would say, fairly high in the level of obstruction compared to the rest of our business, recently, we've seen some very interesting areas such as automotive, where OEMs are buying from us the security for the software sort of coming down and the security for the hardware moving up. And so in that sense, it becomes an area that we will continue to invest in, and I think is crucial for the future. But it is clear that the EDA and IP areas have been particularly strong at this point in time.Shelagh GlaserYes. And I would add that our long-term view of that business is 15% to 20% due to some of the headwinds that Aart mentioned. We think we're probably closer to the lower end of that, closer to the 15% this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel.Ruben RoyAart, I had a couple of AI questions. I'll ask them both the question and the follow-up. As the AI product family starts to take shape 200 tape-outs or production tape-outs, I guess, you said. Are you seeing kind of a sweet spot in kind of where AI is being implemented in terms of either I don't know, type of design, gate count? Or is it kind of a broad-based usage of AI? And the follow-up to that, I guess, longer term, I was wondering if you think that as the AI tools develop, if you think that either semiconductor companies or nontraditional semiconductor companies that historically might have been reluctant to design custom semiconductors, right, because of the expense and maybe went to merchant ships that were invested or FPGAs or what have you, do you think that your productivity improvement from AI may push those customers towards custom semi designs in the future?Aart J. de GeusWell, those are great questions because as you were asking them, I was feverishly thinking, okay, what have we indeed done? And you may know that many, many years ago, recording the term techonomics as really this notion of at any point in time, judging the advances of technology through the economic feedback loop or the opposite, looking at the economics that are possible and then figuring out which technology would have the shortest-term impact. And so it's not by accident that we focused first on DSO. And by the way, it was DSO for really advanced designs because these are really, really hard. And actually, you can sort of almost feel that the human ability to see all dimensions while extraordinary from an architecture point of view gradually diminishes for the details. And so when you're certainly dealing with literally trillions of decisions in a design, many are very small decisions, but a small decision can corrupt the design in weird ways, automation can really handle that better. And so that is where we started. We then decided to broaden to other areas that have high economic impact. And so verification, it falls in that category because since beginning of at least electronic time, you were never done verifying. It was all the question how much can you afford? And if you could, for the same price get twice as much, you would absolutely go for it. And so the benefit was a very positive feedback. And in many ways, the same for test, where every test that you do on a tester machine costs money for the manufacturing people. And so instead of 50,000 tests you can do 25,000 tests and get the same quality of results, that is economically viable. But your question is an interesting second (inaudible), which is this whole question of, are there certain things in custom design that could be impacted. And here, we have not really formally announced anything, but we have absolutely great results in a number of customers already retargeting from one technology node to another. And these are good examples that will become very relevant for much of the customer design and a number of other things as well. So we raced forward on the hottest vector, so to speak, but we have also substantially broadened. And that's the reason that we put the investments in to have a suite, so many common mechanisms in Synopsys.OperatorOur last question will come from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank.Gianmarco Paolo ContiI appreciate your comments on hardware. I'm sorry to touch again on this. I was wondering if you could maybe share a little bit more detail about the demand environment here, both on emulation and prototyping? Given we're sitting in H1, do you have full visibility into 2023 fiscal year on the hardware deliveries? Are the emulation trends ultimately, how should we think about the hardware development beyond the 2023 given 2022 was indeed a record year and 2023 is expected also to be a record year from a harder perspective. I'm just trying to think here, will there be a point in time where [DSM] companies would have caught up on computational power for a year or 2 until the next big challenge comes? And then I'll ask a follow-up after.Aart J. de GeusOkay. Well, there are record years and record years, right? If you're growing a company, hopefully, on a linear scale or trailing 12 months or so, you're a little bit record every quarter. The last few years have been particularly lumpy for a variety of reasons, some to do directly with hardware, some to do with supply chains and some to do with COVID changing the world. And so in aggregate, though, if you buy into my premise that there will be more and more need for fast verification, hardware-accelerated verification is absolutely worthwhile because of the speed that you can get. On top of that, the intersection with software is a little bit more complex than that because we have not only hardware verification but also virtual verification and combination of the 2. And that's why Synopsys is so well positioned at that intersection. But be it as it may, all of those things are going to continue to increase in importance. And our job is to just keep up: a, from the technologies that are available to us. Now we're on the spot of delivering something that has to be state-of-the-art. Secondly, to make that in such a fashion that it's economically, i.e. techonomics for our customers viable and so on. And we have to deliver the fact that they will need more. And so that is a self-regulating business opportunity, but there's no doubt whatsoever that this will continue for quite a while.OperatorThis concludes our Q&amp;A session for today. I now would like to turn the call back to Synopsys' CEO, Aart de Geus.Aart J. de GeusWell, thank you again for participating. I hope that you got the sense that we had a very strong quarter and that we're enthusiastic about the future, be it technology-wise and business-wise. And in all cases, we're always thankful for your participation in this event. Have a good rest of the day.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

First-quarter earnings of another Latin American carrier, Copa Holdings CPA, were discussed in the previous write-up.The labor trouble at Southwest Airlines LUV is unlikely to end soon, with its pilots voting in favor of a strike, citing the company’s inaction as the reason for their move. Meanwhile, Allegiant Travel Company ALGT carried 0.3% fewer passengers year over year on its scheduled flights in April.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1. Azul, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), incurred a loss (excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) of 99 cents per share in the first quarter of 2023, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 42 cents.Total revenues of $862.1 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $930.9 million but increased 41.1% year over year as air-travel demand has improved. With more people taking to the skies, Azul’s passenger revenues, contributing 93.1% to the top line, jumped 46.7% year over year (on higher total capacity). Cargo and other revenues declined 11.9% year over year. Management expects an EBITDA of R$5.5 billion for the current year. Capacity is expected to increase 14% for 2023 from the 2022 actuals.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. Southwest Airlines’ pilots have overwhelmingly voted in favor of a strike. This heightened labor-related tensions for the Dallas-based company. Per the Southwest Pilots Association, the voting procedure (whose duration was more than a week) saw 98% of the total pilots cast their votes. Of them, 99% of pilots voted in favor of a strike.Even though pilots have voted in favor of a strike, it is highly doubtful that the same will materialize eventually, as the law makes it extremely difficult. Therefore, negotiations are likely to continue. The union hopes that this strike approval will exert pressure on the airline in the ongoing negotiations. However, the union has assured that scheduled operations will not be impacted.Story continues3. In April 2023, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) and available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 1% and 2.1%, respectively, from the year-ago levels, at ALGT. Also, scheduled departures increased 1.1% year over year. However, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased 1 point to 84.3% in April 2023, as the traffic increase was less than the capacity expansion.Capacity increased 2.5% from the year-ago month’s reading for the total system. Departures (systemwide) improved 1.5% from the April 2022 actuals. The estimated average fuel cost per gallon for April was $2.84 (systemwide).PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the last five trading days. Despite that, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index increased 6.3 to $62.76%, mainly owing to the significant price appreciation at Copa Holdings following its stellar first-quarter results on May 10.

106,ce3c43e8-b9bf-4134-8a4b-988f36f2530c,LUV,2023-05-20,The triumphs and challenges of Pete Buttigieg's biggest role yet: 'You're gonna get shot at',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-timeline-183551314.html,1684348551,STORY,"['LUV', 'NSC']","[The US Secretary of Transportation typically carries one of the lowest profiles of anyone in the president's cabinet.But for Pete Buttigieg, who cemented his status as a Democratic rising star during the 2020 presidential primary, his tenure in the role has been anything but under the radar given several high-profile issues related to transportation in America.The official mission of the Office of Secretary of Transportation is to ""formulate national transportation policy; prepare needed transportation legislation; help negotiate and implement international transportation agreements; assure the fitness of U.S. airlines and enforce airline consumer protection regulations.""Serving in the presidential cabinet has been a big step up in his career: Buttigieg's only previous experience in elected office came as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Based on the notable challenges and events detailed below, Buttigieg has learned a lot on the job. And it has not come without controversy or criticism.Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst and consultant, believes Buttigieg was tapped for his role because of his ability to communicate, noting that Buttigieg, in a way, has become a spokesperson for the Biden administration on ""a whole series of issues which are not even tangential to transportation.""""He’s a well-spoken individual,"" Mann told Yahoo Finance. ""He can carry a tune very, very well, often when it has nothing to do with his daytime job. As one of my former bosses used to say, 'Pioneers get arrows in their heads.' If you’re going to go out there and lead something, you’re gonna get shot at.""Challenge #1: Air travel in wake of the pandemicOne of Buttigieg's first tasks in his new role was to tackle the transportation issues that arose during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in the airline industry.The American Rescue Plan — a $1.9 trillion bill that provided financial support to federal agencies, local governments, and citizens — allocated $43 billion worth of resources toward Department of Transportation (DoT) efforts to protect and maintain aviation and transit jobs and the overall transportation and logistics economy.Story continuesWhen the pandemic disrupted the travel industry, airlines were struggling. Consumer complaints were higher than pre-pandemic levels as flight cancellations, delays, baggage mishandling, and oversold tickets tarnished the image of many domestic and international airlines, according to a report from the Department of Transportation.Before Buttigieg took office as part of President Joe Biden's cabinet, the department had enforced a new rule for airlines to refund passengers for cancellations or significant schedule changes made by the airline. Air Canada refused to refund cash to their customers.The department filed an official complaint seeking $25 million against Air Canada, whose customers had been waiting between five months and a year for refunds. The parties eventually settled in November 2021 with a $4 million agreement. Out of that, $2 million went to the US Treasury, but customers eventually got their refund.""I think any time you sell a ticket and collect revenue in exchange for a promise to get somebody from point A to point B, you need to be prepared to actually do that,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance in an interview in July 2022. ""And that's a conversation we've been pressing the airlines a lot.""As travel demand rebounded and consumer complaints skyrocketed again, Buttigieg continued to fine airlines for consumer violations and tarmac delays. The department also introduced more consumer protections by providing more resources and flexibility to help it prioritize hearing procedures against unfair practices like deceptive fares of airlines and ticketing agents.During the 2022 winter holiday season, Southwest Airlines (LUV) canceled more than 16,000 flights, stranding millions of passengers across the country. Southwest had been slow to embrace technological updates to their system, which resulted in staff shortages as they could not reassign crews from canceled flights and had to do so manually.In response, Buttigieg vowed the DoT would ""mount an extraordinary effort"" to hold the airline accountable for the disruptions and lost baggage. Southwest Airlines is currently under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Along with shortages of pilots and other staff, political issues arose: GOP politicians have proposed cutting federal funding for programs by 22%-30%, according to Democratic estimates, including slashing discretionary spending by DoT. The House Democrats Appropriations Committee asserted that those cuts could lead to the closure of 125 air traffic control towers, which would affect one-third of all US airports, impact infrastructure investments, and interfere with other FAA operations.Travelers wade through the line to drop off bags at the Southwest Airlines check-in counter at Denver International Airport, Dec. 27, 2022. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""These GOP budget cuts would reduce our ability to hire air traffic controllers,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance (video above). ""I would argue that air traffic control is not optional. It's a very important part of our economy.""More recently, Biden and Buttigieg proposed new rules that would require airlines to compensate passengers under certain circumstances.""We think that the right way forward is to establish requirements across the board so that any passenger flying on an airline in the US knows what they can expect and knows that the airline can't change the rules on them,"" Buttigieg told NPR.Challenge #2: 'We don't want to waste money'The Department of Transportation under Buttigieg has enjoyed a budget boom, thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), as the Biden administration has put more money into the department than any prior administration.The $1.2 trillion bill provided funding for improving and building more roads, bridges, railways, air travel, public transit, internet connections, and electric vehicles as well as for increasing environmental protections.That funding is provided to individual infrastructure projects in each state via grant programs. For example, in March 2022, a total of $409 million was allocated to 70 projects in 39 states over the next five years with the sole purpose of remodeling bus systems and shifting them toward electric public buses.So far, all states received a minimum of 30% in transportation funds out of the infrastructure bill, according to data from the General Services Administration (GSA). Texas and California received the most amount of funding with $12 billion and $14 billion, respectively. After the money reaches the local and state administrations, it is up to each state to decide how and where they spend the funding.""I think the challenge is communicating a real vision for what the future of these investments should be,"" Andy Winkler, director of housing and infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""We don't want to waste money. We don't want to just put band-aids on projects. There is a real opportunity to transform American infrastructure.""Buttigieg recently noted that he wanted to spend some of that budget to help ailing city transit systems, particularly in D.C.""There are flexibilities in the budget that we’re putting forward right now on Capitol Hill to help transit agencies weather the current circumstances they’re in and get to the other side, where there can be a better future for everybody,” Buttigieg said in April.Challenge #3: Supply chain woesThe chaos within Buttigieg's Transportation Department stretches internationally through supply chain issues.The pandemic led to the Great Supply Chain Disruption in 2020 as lockdowns, labor shortages, and online shopping sprees led to heavy backlogs and delays at ports and terminals. This was still prevalent when Buttigieg took control of the Transportation Department.In 2021, the department invested a total of $491 million in ports and small shipyards through two grant programs: the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) and the Small Shipyard Grant Program. The department stated that the investments were to go directly to improve port facilities and ease the supply chain pressure. The PIDP investment came via the infrastructure bill that allotted $17 billion for ports and waterways.Evergreen Lineâs Ever Forward container ship is being taken to an anchorage south of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. (Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) (Baltimore Sun via Getty Images)Some local port disruptions also occurred in March 2022. A 1,095-foot cargo ship called Ever Forward got stuck in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. (Last year, the Port of Maryland was also able to receive $15 million in federal funding.)Overall, however, things have largely calmed since the supply chain disruptions of the pandemic era.""Right now, at worst, the amount of ships waiting in anchor at the ports of Long Beach is in the single digits, and we’re often seeing that backlog completely gone,"" Buttigieg said during his tour of the UPS Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky, in December 2022. ""At the same time, we saw record sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.""As of 2023, supply chains gradually returned to normalcy as freight rates fell from record highs.Challenge #4: A near-strike and train derailments in OhioAt the end of 2022, rail workers prepared to go on a nationwide strike after being unable to reach a labor agreement with rail carriers until Biden signed a bill to ban rail strikes.More than 400 groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, lobbied for Biden to prevent those strikes. It was projected by the railroad industry that a rail worker strike would cost the US economy $2 billion per day, according to CNBC.Railroad unions had been negotiating with railway carriers since 2019. A Biden- and Buttigieg-backed proposal included a 24% increase in wages and allowed workers to go to medical appointments without being reprimanded, but lacked paid sick leave.This came at a time when the railroad industry wrestled with employment decline. Less than 3% of the nation's total transportation workforce comprises railway workers, compared to the increasing employment in warehouses and courier services.The strike was ultimately averted by Congress stepping in, but railroad workers continue to pressure Congress and the White House to address working conditions, while railway carriers have reported record profits and expenses this past year.And then came a high-profile accident: On Feb. 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern (NSC) train carrying toxic materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Residents were evacuated due to public health concerns from the chemicals and a ""drastic change in temperature in one of the rail cars"" that could have led to an explosion.Barely a month later, a second Norfolk Southern train had 28 cars derail in Springfield, Ohio, though there was no imminent public harm.""Until the number of derailments is zero and rail workers are confident in being fully equipped to do their jobs safely, everyone involved in our rail system must make safety improvements a priority,"" Buttigieg wrote in a letter to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw.Michael McCormick, a former top FAA official, told The Independent that he would give Buttigieg a failing grade for his response to the train derailments in Ohio.“He just hasn’t been fast enough and assertive enough in terms of addressing public concerns around these areas,” McCormick said.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tours the site of the Norfolk Southern train derailment on Feb. 23, 2023 in East Palestine, Ohio. (Allie Vugrincic/The Vindicator via AP, Pool) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)After the East Palestine derailment, both Democrats and Republicans criticized Buttigieg, and the Transportation Secretary admitted that he should have visited East Palestine sooner.At the same time, Buttigieg is the first Transportation Secretary to visit a derailment site. He stated that he wanted the investigators of the National Transportation Safety Board to first finish their evaluation before he responded and stressed that the people of East Palestine take priority. He also said he is now seeking tougher train safety rules.""As I watch the news coverage, it looks like every politician, from the local level to the federal level, is trying to jump in front of the camera and say, 'I'm gonna save your lives,'"" Joseph Schofer, professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University told Yahoo Finance at the time. ""But we really don't have a good sense of the scope of the problem and whether what we're seeing, particularly the several events in Ohio, are in any way connected.""On average, there are three derailments per day across the US, even though, overall, railway operations have gotten safer in the past two decades. In comparison, there are more hazardous material fatalities on highways than on railroads, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.Facing pressure, Buttigieg again argued that proposed GOP budget cuts would hinder the department's ability to regulate the freight industry.""A lot of times, they talk about our budget, our spending, as if just anything that wasn't defense was optional,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance. ""I would argue that freight railroad safety inspections are not optional. Lives depend on it.""Challenge #5: Building bridges With the 2024 presidential race heating up, President Biden is currently on a tour to highlight the ""manufacturing boom"" of investments in bridges, along with affordable electric vehicles.The number of bridges needing repairs has remained at 223,000 since 2021. Projections from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association show that it could take 68 years to repair all of America's bridges, while the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association is projecting it to take nearly 30 years.As of 2022, the states with the most number of ""structurally deficient"" bridges were Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Iowa, all with more than 2,000 ""structurally deficient"" bridges. In January 2022, a bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, collapsed as a bus and some cars were crossing.Even the bridge close to Buttigieg's office in D.C. is considered ""structurally deficient.""""We have changed the trajectory of infrastructure in the US,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance on February 1. ""This is the most funding we’ve put into roads and bridges since the interstate highway system was created in the first place.""Despite the criticisms Buttigieg has garnered since taking office, Mann, the airline industry analyst, said the job comes with the territory.""The No. 1 issue is these are folks who need to understand the degree to which transportation is at large,"" Mann said. ""This is more than just air transportation issues. This is rails. It’s surface transportation. It’s maritimes, it’s pipelines. It’s all forms of transportation, which potentially provide significant economic growth, but need to be constructively regulated and in some cases reformed.""He added: ""You’re always fighting the battle between doing the right thing from an economic perspective, a trade perspective, [and] an environmental perspective in addition to the transportation perspective.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Cisco, Inc. (CSCO) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM).

The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. The stock was up big following the last quarterly release on February 22nd and Nvidia fans will be hoping for a repeat perforance it comes out with quarterly numbers this coming Wednesday (May 24th).A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Cisco have modestly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+16.1% vs. +15.5%).

Expanding growth opportunities for low-power-consuming technologies, including IoT, Silicon One and Power over Ethernet bodes well for Cisco.

The company has been battling cost-related headwinds and expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and United States.Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2023 and is likely to drive performance in the full year.A focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Synopsys, Inc.

The dividend yield will be 7.6% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Western Union's dividend was only 47% of earnings, however it was paying out 124% of free cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.EPS is set to fall by 12.1% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 56%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.94. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.9% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Western Union has been growing its earnings per share at 22% a year over the past five years. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Our Thoughts On Western Union's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think Western Union is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks. 2023 was a tough year for some sectors of the stock market, or at least for some sectors. The market has had a tumultuous couple of years, which started with the outbreak of the coronavirus. The pandemic cut stock markets' value by nearly one third, but the resulting recovery was equally stunning as well. The recovery proved to be a boon for the technology sector, as lockdowns grew the demand for their products. Whether it was retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), who helped people do their shopping from home, or firms like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), whose computing products surged into consumer's hands, or even companies like Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), who surged on the stock market when the demand for remote work and video conferencing boomed, the post-pandemic stock market recovery was a great time to be in technology stocks.Yet, as they say, all good things must come to an end - so did this good fortune for the technology companies on the stock market. In 2022 as the after effects of the expansionary fiscal policies of the pandemic government and the Russian invasion of Ukraine made their mark, technology companies dropped on the market and bled investors dry. Yet, it appears as if hedge funds are now taking these price drops as an opportunity to buy on the dip. This has been the trend in some of the hedge fund portfolios that we have analyzed so far after their filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed portfolio compositions. For instance, billionaire David Tepper's 2023 portfolio has several new stock additions that are technology companies. These include NVIDIA and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), alongside a 390% growth in investment in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Another popular hedge fund that increased exposure to the technology industry is Bill Ackman's Pershing Square which took up a cumulative $1.06 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Story continuesThis trend, as you'll find out today, is also present when we look at another billionaire hedge fund manager's investment portfolio for Q1 2023. This manager is Dan Loeb who heads the hedge fund Third Point Management. Third Point is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with its portfolio currently worth $6.1 billion according to Insider Monkey's research. The portfolio's size is yet to reach the level at which it stood by the end of Q1 2022, but is slowly growing to touch the previous levels.Like some of his other hedge fund peers, Mr. Loeb is also a billionaire with Forbes Magazine placing his latest net worth estimate at $3.5 billion. His hedge fund employs a variety of trading strategies on the financial markets. These include activist investments, venture capital investments, structured and corporate credit strategies, and long and short equity investments. This enables the firm to take a look at the debt strategies of companies to leverage them to its advantage, profit from corporate management weaknesses, and capitalize on share price movements in both directions.As for Mr. Loeb, he started tinkering with the stock market during his time in high school and continued it into college as well. He was initially quite successful, and during his time at Columbia University, he would end up making $120,000. Yet, his inexperience in the stock market made him invest all of it into a medical equipment company to lose the winnings - an occurrence that would provide him practical experience about the perils of placing all your eggs in a single basket. Before setting up Third Point Management in 1995, he would work in the financial and corporate world for a decade.He's quite popular in the investment world as well, especially when it comes to letter writing. His latest letter was sent to the embattled firm Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. The letter criticized the firm's chairwoman and shared:Since our engagement with Ms. Nash began, we have detected a pronounced aversion to including a shareholder representative on the Board. At the same time as we identified Ms. Brady, we proposed a fellow shareholder with impeccable credentials as a second candidate. This individual has years of public market experience, an exemplary record as a corporate director of a larger company, and a strong relationship with one of the top consumer investment companies in the world. Ms. Nash, who was presumably speaking on behalf of the Board, gave unconvincing explanations for rejecting this candidate.Shortly after rebuffing our candidate, and within a week of accepting Lucy Brady (though, oddly without recognizing our role in proposing her), yesterday, the Company hastily announced the appointment of Steve Voskuil to the Board. While we recognize Mr. Voskuil’s financial experience, this Board’s handpicked new director does not assuage our concerns about substantial corporate governance shortcomings. It is further concerning that the Board added a shareholder-identified candidate without being fully transparent about the process that led to her selection.It seems as if this Board is operating in triage mode rather than via best corporate governance practices. We fear the reason that the Board is reacting this way is because they (and others) have many reasons to close the curtain before shareholders can take a closer look at what transpired on their watch.So, wondering what's on Mr. Loeb's mind these days? Well, you came to the right place as we look at precisely that in this article, with some top picks being HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock PicksOur Methodology To compile our list of Dan Loeb's latest stock picks, we look at the fund's latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and and picked the ten firms by investment in which Third Point had initiated new stakes in the first quarter.Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks10. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)Third Point's Investment: $41.9 million Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a mining company that has operations in different countries all over the world. It explores for and produces copper, zinc, and other materials.By the end of last year's fourth quarter, 62 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought a stake in Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK). The firm's largest shareholder during Q1 2023 was Eric W. Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners with a $404 million stake that comes courtesy of 11 million shares.Along with Alphabet Inc.

They are well-established, have more analyst coverage, and frequently pay dividends, all undeniably significant benefits that make them so popular among investors.For those with an appetite for large-caps, three companies – Kroger Co. KR, PPG Industries PPG, and Electronic Arts EA – have all seen their near-term earnings outlook shift positively and carry solid projected growth.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKroger Co. Founded in 1883, the long-time retailer operates approximately 2,700 retail stores under various banners and divisions in 35 states.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Koninklijke Philips (PHG). PHG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 16.82, while its industry has an average P/E of 22.79. Over the past year, PHG's Forward P/E has been as high as 25.96 and as low as 9.44, with a median of 13.46.We also note that PHG holds a PEG ratio of 0.94. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PHG's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.69. Within the past year, PHG's PEG has been as high as 1.28 and as low as 0.85, with a median of 1.04.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PHG has a P/S ratio of 0.96. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.59.Story continuesPerrigo (PRGO) may be another strong Medical - Products stock to add to your shortlist. PRGO is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Furthermore, Perrigo holds a P/B ratio of 0.92 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.58. PRGO's P/B has been as high as 1.21, as low as 0.91, with a median of 1.02 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Koninklijke Philips and Perrigo's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

It is our belief that someone with a disability must be able to experience web-based services, content and other digital products with the same successful outcome as those without disabilities.This awareness and commitment to inclusion is the reason we are recognizing Global Accessibility Awareness Day (gaad2023).Recognizing the need for digital accessibilityThis year, sponsored by the (DBRC), our global teams will be encouraged to use a range of accessibility tools to understand how disabilities impact someone's ability to fully utilize digital tools and technologies. Our DBRC provides information and works to find resources for our employees when they have specific needs. They also host events that help educate and direct our employees to outside resources that may be helpful to them.This year marks the 12th anniversary of GAAD which is designed to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital access and inclusion, and the more than one billion people globally with disabilities or impairments.Digital Design System and Technology ApplicationsThrough our Digital Design System and Digital Accessibility consulting, we're ensuring that the authenticated experiences we deliver clients and partners are accessible for all users.""The key to an inclusive experience is each team's commitment to building with accessibility in mind. Through digital enablers like our design system and accessibility consulting, we can empower teams to meet WGAC compliance requirements."" John Fisher - Head of Experience Design &amp; ResearchChristine Holmes, Program Manager for the Digital Accessibility Team and leader within the DBRC, is a part of the Design Enablement practice. She works in closely with the Design System Product team to ensure that it's completely accessible and a source of best practices and consults with teams to address accessibility throughout the delivery cycle, from planning, to design, to development and delivery.Story continuesOne of the many benefits of using our Digital Design System for authenticated client and partner experiences is its adherence to WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance. For example, if a developer uses our ‘button' component, it's already accounted for color contrast, labels, and tagged for screen readers.Microsoft has done a wonderful job addressing accessibility and are taking advantage of this as we are rolling out the Microsoft 365 suite of applications. These applications come with many tools that can be useful to our people with disabilities.The Digital Accessibility Team is available to consults with teams across all of Northern Trust. Teams are responsible for preliminary testing but can engage to consult and understand issues that need remediation.This includes:Reviewing design to avoid any accessibility issues.Showing developers how to identify accessibility issues.Showing quality assurance specialists available tools and how to perform required manual tests.Reviewing encountered issues, consult on remediation and priority.When we look at digital accessibility we focus on several areas:Ensuring Color Contrast is at certain level so that individuals with color blindness can interact fully on our applications.Testing the applications with keyboard interactions alone (not using a mouse at all), so that individuals who use assistive technology can work on our platforms.Testing our applications with screen readers to ensure that individuals with low vision or blindness can work on our applications.Lori Roth who is a Director/Application Manager at Northern Trust says that when it comes to the actual technology applications, AA compliance is our target across internal and external channels, tools and technologies. Our technology application teams deliver digital solutions to all of Northern Trust. Accessibility is embedded into every delivery project with a strategy of ""accessible from start"". It all starts with designers and product owners, writing the requirements with accessibility in mind. Then for developers to pull accessibility through the solution, and finally testing for accessibility to confirm compliance.We embed accessibility into the procurement process from the beginning. So when we are looking at bringing in new tools, they must be compliant with our accessibility standards. To ensure teams understand all the compliance rules, Lori and her team recommends delivery teams review the rules regularly and leverage the resources available to ensure they are up to speed on the latest accessibility requirements and tools.We also have automated tools to help the developers catch issues with accessibility compliance in testing - approximately 40% can be caught via automation, and the balance through manual testing for which we have established best practices.Accessibility in our workplacesIn addition to our focus on digital accessibility, we also consider and plan for accessibility in the workplace. When we are building out new spaces, we practice Universal Design according to Sara Bonett. This ensures that spaces are available for all of our people to use with ease.We also recognize that our employees spend many hours in the workplace and therefore we have considered the below as a corporate standard for all locations:Ergonomic ChairsAdjustable Monitor ArmsConvenience power at desk-topOur team has also implemented height adjustable workstations. This gives our employees the ability to adjust their workstation to their comfort. Height adjustability doesn't just afford employees to sit or stand as they work - but it also allows them to do smaller adjustments for comfort as well. In many new renovations we review lighting specifications and the acoustic experience in our enclosed rooms to enhance the user's experience.Recently we've been rolling out some very exciting video pods in some of our locations. Many manufacturers standard offering is a small enclosed space with a step-up entry. The workplace team did extensive research and worked with external partners to find the right manufacturer to introduce a video pod that allows for any user to enter. The pods specific for accessibility have doors that automatically open with a push button and employees can experience the enhanced video conference experience with a space. This research has helped define a standard for this in our corporate locations and as we embark on new projects we always make sure they reach these minimum requirements.Another thing that we consider in all builds and currently in some of our global offices - such as London - is a wide variety of seating options. We provide a variety of furniture options - different heights - different chair types - in all of our amenity spaces that allow employees to find a space they are most comfortable.

B, American International Group AIG, ArcelorMittal MT, KB Home KBH and Pampa Energia S.A. PAM.Buy These 5 Low Price-to-Sales Stocks for a Sparkling PortfolioInvestment in stocks after the analysis of the valuation metrics is considered one of the best practices. When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profit.What's Price-to-Sales Ratio?While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock's price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. Therefore, a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar's worth. Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.Story continuesIn any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Barnes Group Inc., American International Group, ArcelorMittal, KB Home andPampa Energia S.A. are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Barnes is a global diversified manufacturer and provider of highly engineered products, innovative solutions, and differentiated industrial technologies.

127,9b9c06a3-cb4e-3a95-a07f-9d9224c8ffed,HOLX,2023-05-20,What's in the Cards for Medtronic (MDT) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-medtronic-mdt-q4-150603060.html,1684508763,STORY,"['MDT', 'HOLX', 'DVA']","[Medtronic plc MDT is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.17%. Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 0.77%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMedtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally in the form of supply chain disruption, a severe shortage of health professional labor and a record level of inflationary pressure. This continued impact of inflation with increased freight expenses is expected to have affected the fourth-quarter performance.Considering how severe the impact of inflation of raw materials and freight has been on the company’s margin in the last quarter, Medtronic, on its fiscal third-quarter earnings call, stated that it expects continued gross margin pressure in the fourth quarter and the next year. The gross margin impact is expected to have translated into a decline in the company’s adjusted operating margin this time around. However, this might have been partially muted by expense control and the benefit of the company’s currency hedging program.In such a scenario, the company has prioritized its R&amp;D investments. This might get reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter results.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteAdded to this, severe currency headwinds are expected to have affected profitability further. In this regard, on the fiscal thrid-quarter earnings call, the company noted that the fourth quarter would experience a currency headwind between $165 million and $215 million on revenues.The company, meanwhile, has been driving significant expense reduction to help offset lower revenues and continued inflation impact. Amid the macro-environmental headwinds in the form of inflation, China VBP and softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currencies, the company claims to have been laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies.Story continuesIn the to-be-reported quarter, Medtronic expects organic revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.0%, implying strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability based on new launches.The company’s Cardiovascular portfolio is expected to gain 5.5% to 6% organically in on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and LINQ II. In cardiac rhythm management, the pacing business is expected to have generated strong sales.In the neuroscience portfolio, the company's market share in Cranial and Spinal technologies is expected to have increased. Demand for the company’s new spine implants is expected to have contributed to the growth. Further, the ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of the company’s best-in-class spinal implants is expected to have contributed to the fourth-quarter top line. The Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system, particularly, are expected to have performed strongly in the to-be-reported quarter.The company earlier expected its neuroscience revenues to grow in the range of 6.5% to 7% organically in the fourth quarter.In Medical Surgical and surgical robotics, Medtronic remains focused on the limited market release of the Hugo robot while it scales production. The company recently completed Hugo installations in several geographies like Denmark, France and Italy, which are likely to have added to the company’s top-line growth within this arm. However, according to Medtronic, given increased volume-based procurement in many Chinese provinces, medical-surgical revenues are expected to be down 2.5% to 3% in the fourth quarter.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States, where Medtronic is lacking in terms of latest products due to regulatory complications. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States on the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor. According to Medtronic, overall Diabetes is expected to decline in the low single digits on an organic basis in the quarter under review.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal fourth-quarter total revenues of $8.25 billion suggests a 1.9% rise from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.56 per share implies a 2.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Medtronic this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

129,4552a4c7-eeae-3f5f-9e6a-3f1ef33511fc,HOLX,2023-05-20,Here's Why You Should Retain QIAGEN (QGEN) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-qiagen-qgen-120512004.html,1684497912,STORY,"['QGEN', 'HOLX', 'ZBH']","[QIAGEN N.V. QGEN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the solid execution of its Five Pillars of Growth strategy and advancements made in the portfolio. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results reflected impressive growth across Non-COVID-19 product groups, which buoys optimism. However, escalating expenses and  decreased COVID-19 sales do not bode well for QIAGEN.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 0.8% compared with the 6.9% rise of the industry and a 6.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Performance: QIAGEN ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings, while revenues were almost in line with estimates. The company delivered high organic revenues exceeding its outlook of approximately $490 million, led by the strength of the non-COVID-19 base business.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe quarter’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 52 cents at the constant exchange rate (CER). The metric surpassed the previously announced guidance of 47 cents at CER.Across product groups, Sample Technologies (comprising one-third of total sales) outperformed in the first quarter, with robust growth in non-COVID-19 applications and gains from instrument sales. QGEN continues to invest in key portfolio areas, including QIAcuity digital PCR, the syndromic system — QIAstat-Dx — and the integrated PCR testing system NeuMoDx.The Five Pillars of Growth Strategy Drives Sales: Amid the uncertain macro environment, significant investments made in the Five Pillars of Growth strategy have contributed to high organic revenues across non-COVID-19 product groups.Within the Diagnostic solutions product group, the QuantiFERON latent TB test was the main driver, with sales rising 19% at CER on growth in all regions. QIAGEN’s digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clinical testing system — QIAstat Diagnostics and NeuMoDx —  progressed well in transitioning to non-COVID utilizations.Story continuesThe QIAcuity portfolio of the PCR system and application kit generated impressive organic sales. This was driven by solid instrument placement and the increasing uptake of consumables across regions. The Sample Technologies group sustained its rising growth trend in the first quarter, supported by solid CER gains in consumables and instrument sales.Portfolio Advancements to Benefit: Throughout the first quarter, QIAGEN made significant progress in its Sample to Insight portfolio. The launch of the QIAstat-Dx syndromic testing platform in Japan expands the list of countries where the instruments are currently used for the diagnostics of various diseases. On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call, QGEN had indicated developing new applications for blood infections, pneumonia and complex urinary tract infection panels.Meanwhile, QIAGEN added the global pharmaceutical group, Servier, as a new partner to its companion diagnostics co-development program. The collaboration is set to develop companion diagnostic for TIBSOVO as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.Within Genomics/NGS, QIAGEN Digital Insights launched an NGS analysis solution that can process a whole genome sequence in about 25 minutes. The enhanced CLC Genomics Workbench Premium product removes data analysis bottlenecks as seen in NGS. This accelerates the analysis and interpretation of whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.DownsidesMounting Expenses Put Pressure: QIAGEN reported a contraction in the adjusted gross margin in the first quarter of 2023. The adjusted operating income (excluding items like acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring and integration and others) declined 47.5% year over year to $121.2 million in the first quarter. Higher R&amp;D costs in the quarter represented 11.3% of sales made toward investments in the Five Pillars of Growth strategy for new products, test menus and applications.COVID-19 Product Sales Decline: Headwinds related to the sales of the COVID-19 product group resulted in QIAGEN’s first-quarter top line declining 20% at CER. For 2023, the company expects a significant drop in the group’s sales.Estimate TrendQIAGEN has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has gone up from $2.10 to $2.12.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.05 billion, suggesting a decrease of 4.2% from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

MAUs can include multiple people using the same account.Still, Wall Street remains bullish, with Wedbush reiterating its Outperform rating and listing the stock on its ""Best Ideas"" list.Wall Street remains bullish on Netflix's ad-supported tier (Wachiwit via Getty Images)""We think Netflix has reached the right formula with its global content to balance costs and generate increasing profitability, while its ad-supported tier and password sharing crackdown should further boost cash generation,"" Wedbush analysts Alicia Reese and Michael Pachter wrote in a new note on Friday.The analysts added those catalysts set up the streamer to ""generate significantly more free cash flow than its guidance suggests.""Profitability, margins and free cash flow surpassed Wall Street expectations in Netflix's first-quarter results. The streamer cut its content spend by $1 billion in the quarter compared to the same period last year.The media giant, which raised its full-year free cash flow projection to $3.5 billion from $3 billion, said it will stay around its $17 billion annual content spend through 2024 but added there's more room to grow.On the ad front, Wedbush said, ""We continue to see significant room for upside as Netflix learns to balance viewership levels with CPM and ad views per hour."" CPM, or premium cost per 1,000 impressions, is an important metric for advertisers.""Netflix should be able to increase Ad [average revenue per user] to the $16 range or higher over time,"" the note added.Story continuesNetflix currently boasts 232.5 million global subscriber base, but the company said ad-based users have more than doubled since early 2023, with more than a quarter of Netflix sign-ups now choosing the ads plan in countries where it's available.Netflix is still battling an ongoing writers' strike, which could impact content spending and upcoming releases, although the company has said it has enough content banked to weather the shutdown.The platform is also facing continued backlash surrounding its password sharing crackdown. It previously said the crackdown will hit the US some time this quarter.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends TJX (TJX) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for TJX is 3.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.1%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for TJX is 8.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for TJX have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made TJX a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that TJX is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Giant snakes. Sharks. Clowns. Piano recitals. And right now, putting your money into retail stocks.Okay, investing in retail stocks might not be as scary as a piano recital, but you see the picture I'm trying to paint. And that scariness is because of what we're hearing from some prominent names in the retail space that have reported earnings this week: Home Depot (HD), TJX Companies (TJX), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT). Let's break it down.Walmart had an impressive quarter against the backdrop of a barely growing economy. But the company is still seeing double-digit percentage inflation on food and other consumable goods, and price-sensitive Walmart shoppers are both buying fewer units and going for the generic private label products over the name-brand stuff.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief here.The pressure consumers feel they are facing is in turn putting pressure on sales. As the first quarter progressed and sales growth moderated sharply, company execs issued a warning for second quarter earnings.""We're seeing trade downs in terms of buying less expensive meats, or instead of buying a pack of 12, they're buying a pack of 6. You can see that their wallets are being stretched more thinly,"" Walmart's well-regarded CFO John David Rainey said.Rainey said on Yahoo! Finance Live (above video) he is also seeing organized retail crime in his stores, in part because of challenging economic conditions.Down and to the right is not a good trend for a chart that measures retail sales. (Bank of America)And then there was the news from Target.The slightly more upscale (but still discount) retailer also came out with underwhelming second quarter guidance, and also cited a more cautious shopper.Target's customers aren't shopping the home goods department, but are instead buying a few groceries and heading home because they're cutting costs.Story continuesAnd to make matters worse, Target's CEO said its customers aren't shopping online. Online sales fell for the second straight quarter.I see more of the same coming from Best Buy's first quarter and outlook next week. Citi seems to agree with ole' Sozz — it slapped the stock with a sell rating (also scary) into earnings with its analysts expecting a bad quarter and outlook.Meanwhile, Home Depot slashed its full-year sales outlook. Why? Interest rates have gone way up, causing homeowners to rethink putting a $50,000 kitchen remodel on a credit card or taking out a loan.TJX Companies — the owner of HomeGoods and Marshalls — had a dreadful sales print at HomeGoods in the first quarter. The company's CEO tried to blow smoke in the face of investors on the earnings call about how HomeGoods was turning the corner.Yeah, and I still have a full head of hair.But you shouldn't be surprised that retailers are saying this stuff. The biggest economic concern among consumers today is inflation, according to a recent Gallup poll. About 83% of those polled think the economy is ""only fair.""Awful.To that end, it's hard to like the short-term outlook for any retail stocks.Some names such as Macy's have tanked this year as investors price in a stretch of sales and profit weakness. But the commentary is so meh from retailers right now you have to wonder if the entire space is poised to get much cheaper.It has to — the charts and valuations aren't scary-low enough given the funk many households are in.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Due to its operational initiatives — a customer-centric approach, an emphasis on the membership program and a focus on value offerings — the stock has outpaced the Zacks Retail-Discount industry. In the said period, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased about 9.1%, while the industry has risen 2.6%.Let’s Delve DeepThis Issaquah, WA-based company continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. Costco's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. Amid rising prices, low-to-middle-income consumers have preferred discount stores over conventional retailers. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding Costco in registering decent sales numbers.Costco’s net sales increased 3% to $17.85 billion for the retail month of April — the four-week period ended Apr 30, 2023 — from $17.33 billion reported last year. This followed improvements of 0.5% and 4.7% in March and February, respectively. Comparable sales for the retail month of April increased 1.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCostco is gradually adopting the omnichannel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics, has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.Costco also remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets. After opening 13, 20 and 23 net new warehouses in fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, Costco plans to open 24 net new units in fiscal 2023.We foresee an improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up. Membership fees increased 6.2% to $1,027 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Story continuesWrapping UpThe strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped Costco draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. We believe a growing customer base and high renewal rates should fuel sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 6.5% and 9.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and General Mills GIS.Kroger, which operates as a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is 6%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kroger’s current financial-year revenues and EPS suggests growth of 2.5% and 6.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure.

Strength in grocery as well as health and wellness was “offset” by weakness in general merchandise, a trend seen across other retailers in the first quarter as well.The quarterly results of Target (TGT), which is more exposed to discretionary general merchandise, tell a different story.Target sees comparable sales in a range of a low-single digit decline to a low-single digit increase for the year as the discretionary category slows.“(Consumers are) investing more in those household essentials and food and beverage items, and they're shopping more cautiously when it comes to all things discretionary,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with reporters.Target also saw a decline in digital comparable sales for the second-straight quarter. Meanwhile, first-quarter e-commerce sales grew by 26% at Walmart.When asked how Walmart grew e-commerce sales while the category lagged at Target, Walmart CFO John David Rainey didn’t address the competitor directly but told Yahoo Finance Live, “Clearly our value proposition is resonating.”Shoppers queue outside Target during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 25, 2022. REUTERS/Jim Vondruska (Jim Vondruska / reuters)In other earnings, TJX (TJX) said that HomeGoods sales dropped 7% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period. But sales in its Marmaxx business, which includes discount chain TJ Maxx, rose 3%. When asked directly about trade downs, TJX CEO Ernie Herman was hesitant to discern what his business is seeing from consumers.Story continues“It’s hard for us to read into trade down and what we're seeing,” Herman said. “There's just so many moving things that are going on right now that it's just tough to read. But like I said, we are seeing that the higher demographic stores in higher demographic areas being more of the driver of our comp at Marmaxx.”Walmart is well-positionedSome Wall Street analysts see this environment setting up ideally for Walmart. Amid a “soft macro environment,"" Bank of America wrote in a note to clients that Walmart’s diversified business is positioned better than Target's.Jefferies research team, which expects a recession in the second half of 2023, agrees that Walmart could be a standout.Ahead of the company’s earnings report, the firm’s retail analyst Corey Tarlowe noted that Walmart is gaining market share from “many other retailers and across the consumer income spectrum.”Reviewing prior recessionary environments, Walmart stock didn’t perform as well as the dollar stores but it still significantly outperformed the overall market, per Tarlowe.“(Walmart is) clearly one that we expect that, despite what economic uncertainty may come, is very well-positioned to outperform,"" Tarlowe told Yahoo Finance Live.More news on the state of consumer spending is expected with Dollar General and Dollar Tree earnings next week.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Opening a crowded week of updates regarding the consumer trends, HD is joined by Target Corporation who managed to top earnings estimates but also observed hesitant consumers. The TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) also topped earnings estimates with Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: BABA) boarding the quarterly report train on Thursday.HD’s Fiscal First QuarterWith customers shifting from big to smaller, more affordable, home improvements, along with cold weather that hampered demand for summer outdoor equipment, revenue fell 4.2% to $37.26 billion. Spring is usually the season for home equipment, like Christmas season is for retailers. But, the weakened macroeconomic environment played its part. Although sales of DIY customers were better than those of home improvement professionals, they both experienced a YoY decline.Net income dropped 8.5% YoY as it amounted to $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, below the expected $3.80 per share.The quarter that ended on April 30th was the second consecutive quarter that Home Depot missed Wall Street’s expectations.HD’s Lowered GuidanceWhat’s even more worrying than a failed spring quarter is that Home Depot and its peers are now facing an even more unpredictable outlook with rising interest rates. It’s not only a matter of a housing market slowdown and essentials taking a bigger bite of households’ budgets, but also the fact that after being held hostage by Covid since 2020, HD’s consumers are finally able to enjoy outdoor experiences and travel.As a result of this softened demand and consumers delaying big projects, Home Depot lowered its full year forecast from roughly flat sales to a decline between 2% and 5%. Operating margin rate is also expected lower, between 14% and 14.3%.Target did deliver an earnings beat, but also warned of cost-conscious consumersStory continuesDespite beating earnings estimates for the second consecutive quarter after three misses, Target is also dealing with effects of persistent inflation and rising interest rates. Moreover, it is also facing with organized retail crime that is expects to trim its full year profits by $500 million. Although net sales rose 0.6% YoY as they amounted to $25.3 billion, digital comparable sales dropped 3.4% after rising 3.2% during last year’s comparable quarter.TJX Raised Its Full-Year Profit Guidance Despite Revenue MissDespite also expecting a challenging second quarter, TJX reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance. Moreover, TJX now expects gross margin to improve by 1% to 28.9% as it benefited from reduced cost pressures after months of struggling with higher costs of law materials, labor and freight expenses. Additionally, TJX sees adjusted profit per share for the fiscal year in the range between $3.39 and $3.48, a rise from prior outlook in the range between $3.29 to $3.41.Net sales for the quarter that ended on April 29th rose 3% YoY which was slightly below analyst estimates, resulting in a net income of $891 million and diluted EPS of $0.76.Shopping Is No Longer The Therapy Of ChoiceSome retailers did worse than others, but the above three reports clearly reflect inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, with everyone expecting tough times to be sticking around for a while.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

142,5401a80e-df73-3de8-8a2a-3d55d11d1f3a,AMGN,2023-05-20,We Think Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-amgen-nasdaq-amgn-stay-110042912.html,1684580442,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Amgen How Much Debt Does Amgen Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2023 Amgen had US$61.6b of debt, an increase on US$36.9b, over one year. However, it does have US$31.6b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$30.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Amgen's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Amgen had liabilities of US$14.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$69.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$31.6b in cash and US$5.74b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$46.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit isn't so bad because Amgen is worth a massive US$119.4b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Amgen has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 5.8 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. Notably Amgen's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Amgen can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amgen recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 91% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewOn our analysis Amgen's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For example, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little nervous about its debt. Considering this range of data points, we think Amgen is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Amgen  you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

Giant snakes. Sharks. Clowns. Piano recitals. And right now, putting your money into retail stocks.Okay, investing in retail stocks might not be as scary as a piano recital, but you see the picture I'm trying to paint. And that scariness is because of what we're hearing from some prominent names in the retail space that have reported earnings this week: Home Depot (HD), TJX Companies (TJX), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT). Let's break it down.Walmart had an impressive quarter against the backdrop of a barely growing economy. But the company is still seeing double-digit percentage inflation on food and other consumable goods, and price-sensitive Walmart shoppers are both buying fewer units and going for the generic private label products over the name-brand stuff.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief here.The pressure consumers feel they are facing is in turn putting pressure on sales. As the first quarter progressed and sales growth moderated sharply, company execs issued a warning for second quarter earnings.""We're seeing trade downs in terms of buying less expensive meats, or instead of buying a pack of 12, they're buying a pack of 6. You can see that their wallets are being stretched more thinly,"" Walmart's well-regarded CFO John David Rainey said.Rainey said on Yahoo! Finance Live (above video) he is also seeing organized retail crime in his stores, in part because of challenging economic conditions.Down and to the right is not a good trend for a chart that measures retail sales. (Bank of America)And then there was the news from Target.The slightly more upscale (but still discount) retailer also came out with underwhelming second quarter guidance, and also cited a more cautious shopper.Target's customers aren't shopping the home goods department, but are instead buying a few groceries and heading home because they're cutting costs.Story continuesAnd to make matters worse, Target's CEO said its customers aren't shopping online. Online sales fell for the second straight quarter.I see more of the same coming from Best Buy's first quarter and outlook next week. Citi seems to agree with ole' Sozz — it slapped the stock with a sell rating (also scary) into earnings with its analysts expecting a bad quarter and outlook.Meanwhile, Home Depot slashed its full-year sales outlook. Why? Interest rates have gone way up, causing homeowners to rethink putting a $50,000 kitchen remodel on a credit card or taking out a loan.TJX Companies — the owner of HomeGoods and Marshalls — had a dreadful sales print at HomeGoods in the first quarter. The company's CEO tried to blow smoke in the face of investors on the earnings call about how HomeGoods was turning the corner.Yeah, and I still have a full head of hair.But you shouldn't be surprised that retailers are saying this stuff. The biggest economic concern among consumers today is inflation, according to a recent Gallup poll. About 83% of those polled think the economy is ""only fair.""Awful.To that end, it's hard to like the short-term outlook for any retail stocks.Some names such as Macy's have tanked this year as investors price in a stretch of sales and profit weakness. But the commentary is so meh from retailers right now you have to wonder if the entire space is poised to get much cheaper.It has to — the charts and valuations aren't scary-low enough given the funk many households are in.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

So what does this tell us about the state of the US consumer?Joining us now, we've got Simeon Hyman, who is the ProShares Global Investment Strategist, and Hitha Herzog, who is the H Squared Research Chief Research Officer. Great to have you both here with us on this Friday morning to round out what has been off into the race as part of the retail sector earnings season here. If we are to kind of summarize this in one word, Simeon, what would you annex to the retail earnings that came through this season?SIMEON HYMAN: It's not omnichannel yet. I was just looking this morning at-- we at ProShares, we have an online retail index and a separate brick-and-mortar index. So we split them.And if you look at earnings season, so far, you've got about half the retailers in so far. The online index has grown, earning 76% year over year, the brick-and-mortar index, -1%. So we're not quite to the point where half of the Walmart square footage is last-mile fulfillment with drones flying out of it.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, Target even had a drop in its online sales, which is also pretty interesting here. Hitha, what do you make of it, right? It has been really interesting to hear the likes of Targets and Walmart for them. And that still point to people not buying electronics, not really buying apparel. It seems like things are really split right now.HITHA HERZOG: That makes complete sense, though. If you walk into a store, the last thing you're pretty-- you're probably going to do if you're watching budget is make a big ticket purchase. You're going to focus on the essentials, the groceries. If you have to remodel, like, your home, or you want something new, you're going to buy something small.Story continuesSo people are really paring back and what they want to purchase and how they're spending that money. And also, I tell people how there is a real bifurcation on how people spent before the pandemic and then after. There was a lot more store traffic in the stores. And then the consumer just got used to spending time on their sofas, spending their money while shopping on their phone, they're scrolling. I always say that if my phone is across the room, that purchase is not going to get made. If I have to walk across the room, get the phone and go ahead and make that purchase, it's not going to happen.JULIE HYMAN: You know, I'm curious in the retailers that you're talking to, kind of what the sentiment is like. Walmart seemed to be in a better position. But even Target, in doing badly, is still sort of measured in its commentary. Is there fear out there among retailers? Like, how are they feeling?HITHA HERZOG: I think for-- well, the big box stores, what we're talking about now, I think right now we're seeing them feel a little bit more confident going into the next quarters. And definitely, in the next year, you saw Walmart raise their guidance, the same thing with Target.They are-- those retailers are realizing that because their concentration is so much on grocery and those essential items, and they're really just doubling down on that-- I talked to one of the chief merchandising officers, well, actually I did-- I did a talk at ""Shoptalk"" with one of the team members of Walmart Merchandising. And she was saying how Walmart really narrows down on the merchandising per local stores.So when you have that localization of merchandise, you tend to get a lot more traffic in the stores and people buying that more.BRAD SMITH: And so just to-- just to follow on that really quickly, and we'd love to get both of your responses on this, Hitha, first to you, does anything about the consumer right now signal what we've been hearing from other CEOs this earnings season in a Q3, 2023 recession?HITHA HERZOG: So what we are seeing with the consumer right now is that they are-- they want to go out and shop. But what they are doing is making sure that the retailer is catering to them.So I was looking at the Unified Benchmark by Manhattan Associates. They were saying that the retailers that really focus in on things like fulfillment and making sure that the consumer is basically have this-- has this return policy on lockdown, they can sit there and return things very quickly and have that logistical side, basically, running like the turnkey, that is the retailers that are going to fare well.The consumer, like I said, is really getting very specific about where they want to shop. They want that holistic approach to shopping if they're going to spend their money. And so while I don't think the consumer is going to be spending, you know, like they did pre-pandemic, I think they are going to be very, very careful about that.They're still feeling scared. There's still headwinds like inflation coming out, even though we're seeing inflation decrease a little bit. They're still-- they're still nervous.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I was one of those consumers, of course, who has taken things home to check them out in my own mirror just to see how they look and then and then, probably, return a few of those things. But the same question to you, Simeon.SIMEON HYMAN: Yeah, I think the mixed results we're seeing from the retailers and consumer, sort of tepid behavior, is consistent with what we're seeing across the economy. That's pointing to-- the debate between a soft landing and stagflation light, I think it's almost a distinction without a meaningful difference.You know, we only had 1% GDP growth in Q1. Suppose that goes to -0.5 or even minus one. Is that really a big difference? And if inflation comes in at 2.75, and we don't declare victory, or it comes all the way down to 2%, I think we're in that realm of somewhere between a soft landing and a very mild recession. And I think the consumer is behaving just like that.JULIE HYMAN: What's also interesting to me is, as we look-- you know, there's the big macro picture and what this means to the economy. There's what it means for if I'm an investor, which retail stocks I might want to look at right now.I think the point you're making is really interesting because we've been talking about consumer discretion, consumer being choosy about what they're buying. I think your point is not only that they're being choosy about where they're buying it because the stakes are so high right now for these retailers to execute pretty much perfectly. I mean, we see Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, obviously, was not executing perfectly and paid the price.HITHA HERZOG: Right.JULIE HYMAN: So looking, from what we've heard from this thus far, looking ahead to specialty retailers reporting like The Gap or Macy's on the department store side, how do you think that's going to play out?HITHA HERZOG: Well, it's interesting because, in that unified benchmark, it was saying that department stores-- you know, we've had this sort of conversation around department stores, anchor stores are starting to close down in malls. But the likes of Macy's have really looked at their metrics and saw what their consumer was doing, what their customer was doing, how they were trying to shop, and what they wanted.Do I think the flagship Macy's really needs some help still? Yes. Do they have it perfect? No.But what they are really trying to do is marry that omnichannel, which-- I don't love that word. I'm sorry.I think that we need a new word for it. That's been around for almost 12 years now. But they want another-- it's another-- they want a fulfilled experience.And I know I keep talking about this returns aspect, but when you have the consumer buying things online, trying them on, and sending them back, that is how the consumer shops. I was thinking about the statistic that I read the other day, that a fourth, excuse me, a third of Americans under the age of 10 don't know what it's like to go into a store and shop. And that makes complete sense.Julie knows I have twin four and a half-year-olds. They don't know what that whole surprise and delight is like going into a store. Their surprise and delight comes from when the Amazon packages come to our home. So when retailers start understanding that is the new consumer coming in, and they're starting to switch their buy, to switch their merchandising to understand that surprise and delight comes in a box, that's when we're really going to start seeing traction, especially into the future.JULIE HYMAN: That is a really good point as I think about it. Like, I remember many hours spent being dragged around with my parents at the mall.HITHA HERZOG: Right.JULIE HYMAN: Now, you don't need to do that because you just go online and buy. But the surprise and delight, I guess, is mitigated when you try it on in the mirror, or it doesn't fit, or whatever it is. And then you've got to send it back.HITHA HERZOG: Exactly. That's kind of a bummer.JULIE HYMAN: That's so interesting, though. These kids who are going to be digitally native in terms of shopping.HITHA HERZOG: Yeah, if you think about it, my daughters have been into a mall once. I grew up in a mall. This is why I do what I do because I love the mall. But my daughters don't know what that experience is like, or they don't have that fulfillment from it.JULIE HYMAN: Really interesting. Hitha, great to see you. Thanks for coming in.HITHA HERZOG: [INAUDIBLE].JULIE HYMAN: Hitha, an old friend of mine. H Squared Research Chief Research Officer.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this casino operator have returned -2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Gaming industry, which Wynn falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Wynn is expected to post earnings of $0.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +128.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +148.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.43 points to a change of +132% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +39.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.81 indicates a change of +236.4% from what Wynn is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Wynn.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WYNN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Wynn, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +54.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $5.75 billion and $6.59 billion estimates indicate +53.1% and +14.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWynn reported revenues of $1.42 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.3%. EPS of $0.29 for the same period compares with -$1.21 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.5%. The EPS surprise was +261.11%.Over the last four quarters, Wynn surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wynn is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wynn. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Joining us now, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. And, Josh, when you take a look at the reaction in the stock today, clearly the Street very excited about what they heard from Barclays. Why are they so bullish?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana, so it's all about that Macau resurgence. And this is something that we heard from Wynn going back to their earnings call a couple of weeks ago, basically saying that Macau is coming back at a faster pace than they had expected and now at a faster pace than Wall Street had expected. So when you take a look at what that Macau segment has done for Wynn, they've reported $600 million in operating revenue in the first quarter. That's the most they've had in Macau since the fourth quarter of 2019.Now, Barclays coming out today and essentially saying they think that Wynn is headed for adjusted EBITDA in comparison to 2019 at a quicker pace than initially anticipated. So they think they're going to get to about 80% of what they were at in 2019 by the end of this year. And then you can see on the chart on your screen, they think they can get to 100% of what they were doing in 2019 by 2024. So into next year.And, Akiko, when we think about casinos as a whole, of course, this is a massive story because Macau used to be more than half of Wynn's overall revenue. And it is obviously a big player for something like Las Vegas Sands as well. It's a huge space or region for casinos.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, yeah. And certainly, with China reopening, that's-- the activity picking up in a big way. How is this affecting other casinos?Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so Las Vegas Sands you saw take a big jump today as well. I think it was up about 3% at one point. Yeah, up about 3% right now. And really, that's also because Las Vegas Sands is actually the biggest player over Macau. They have the most market share. So it's Las Vegas Sands, then Wynn, then MGM Resorts. And what's been interesting to see in commentary-- and Barclays was pointing this out today as well-- is travel still isn't all the way back to Macau.So they've started to see more travel from inside China. But those surrounding countries, if you take a look at visitation from surrounding countries, it actually has not picked up really anywhere close to the levels it was in 2019. So there's still a lot more visitation to come. And so essentially, the argument here from the Street is, you can get out ahead of this because it's not really priced into the stock yet. And those revenues are going to keep going up and keep coming back. And that's obviously bullish overall for the space.SEANA SMITH: Josh, what about the outlook here for Las Vegas? Because you and I have talked a number of times over the last several months that Las Vegas, the numbers of travelers that they are seeing day in and day out, the rates that they are charging for the hotels are at a record levels.JOSH SCHAFER: And Wynn is winning that battle, which I think is fascinating too. There was a chart in that note pointing out that Wynn is actually getting the most per table, the most per slot, the most per room of anyone right now in Vegas. And Barclays came out and said that they think that that's going to be sticky. They think that Vegas travel overall is going to stay resilient. And they think Wynn is the winner in that space. Now, of course, when we talk overall slowdown, the question is, does that continue, right? Do people keep traveling to Vegas over the course of the year? Right now, we haven't seen any indicators that that won't keep happening.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, and you wonder if that's going to pick up going into the summer. We keep hearing domestic travel staying closer to home. Vegas kind of the perfect opportunity. Although, I don't think I want to stay there in that weather.JOSH SCHAFER: Not a far flight from LA, right, Akiko?SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, you could even drive there.AKIKO FUJITA: It's not a far drive.JOSH SCHAFER: Akiko might be telling us about her vacation plans, I think.AKIKO FUJITA: You might find me in Vegas in a few months. We'll see. All right, thanks so much for that, Josh.]"

The firm is bullish on the casino operator thanks to a resurgence in Macau coupled with growth in Las Vegas.Shares of Wynn popped more than 6% on Wednesday while fellow Macau operators, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and MGM (MGM), also traded higher.Barclays is now overweight all three major Macau operators, including Wynn, Las Vegas Sands, and MGM Resorts International“Evidence is accruing that WYNN’s Macau business is heading for 2019 EBITDA generation faster than we (or we think anyone) thought, and soon we could be talking about 'how much above 2019' Wynn Macau can recover to,” Montour wrote in a note to clients.In the first quarter of this year, Wynn reported $600.1 million in operating revenue for its Macau segment, the highest quarterly report since the fourth quarter of 2019. Las Vegas Sands more than doubled its Macau revenues from 2022, posting first-quarter revenue of $1.28 billion in the region. Similarly, MGM Resorts China segment saw quarterly revenue increase 140% from the year prior.""Macau is coming back quickly,"" Wynn Resorts CEO Craig Billings said during the company's earnings call on May 9.But the closely watched region that's lagged due to COVID-19 disruptions in China isn't back to normal yet. MGM noted its first-quarter adjusted EBITDAR [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs] represented an 88% recovery to where it was prior to the first quarter in 2019.Part of that could be attributed to travel numbers. First-quarter mainland flights to Macau were below 77% of 2019 levels while visitation from surrounding countries remains below pre-pandemic levels, according to Barclays.Story continuesThat's been reflected in revenue numbers, too. Despite Las Vegas Sands' growth from 2022, the first quarter Macau revenue of $1.28 billion is still a far cry from the $2.33 billion in the first quarter of 2019.""[Macau] is in its infancy as far as a return to a more normal operating environment,"" Las Vegas Sands CEO Rob Goldstein told investors during the company's earnings call on April 19. ""It's not even — I think we're — it's still early days there. This first quarter is still not a representation of what can happen in Macau or will happen. So, I wouldn't call it normal operating mode. And as you referenced, the acceleration in revenues is clearly there and that will accelerate margins.""People wait to get in outside Wynn Palace, U.S. casino tycoon Steve Wynn's newest resort, during its opening in Macau, China August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip (Bobby Yip / reuters)The growing anticipation for a strong return of Macau comes as Las Vegas traffic has boomed following pandemic lockdowns. Barclays believes the region may be ""more resilient,"" than pre-pandemic, and Wynn is strategically benefitting more than other players in the region.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, NRG Energy has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while RWE AG has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NRG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NRG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.30, while RWEOY has a forward P/E of 11.48. We also note that NRG has a PEG ratio of 0.82. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. RWEOY currently has a PEG ratio of 7.92.Another notable valuation metric for NRG is its P/B ratio of 3.20. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Masco's shares before the 25th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.28 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.14 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Masco has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of $52.55. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Masco Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Masco paid out just 24% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 30% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Masco's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Masco's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 22% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Masco has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Masco? Masco has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.So while Masco looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Be aware that Masco is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored...A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Most companies offer their products to retail and foodservice customers, while some also cater to deli and commercial operators, including grocery retailers, grocery wholesalers, meat distributors, warehouse club stores, industrial food processing companies, chain restaurants, international export companies, school cafeterias and hospitals, among others. Some products offered include frozen whole chicken, primary pork cuts, salads, sandwiches and meatballs.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Meat Food IndustryDemand for Protein, Plant-Based Meat Gains Popularity: The demand for protein-packed food has been rising due to consumers’ growing health consciousness. Consumers, especially fitness enthusiasts, have been adopting protein-rich, ketogenic diets. The increasing demand for protein has been working well for meat product companies, which have been focused on strengthening their portfolio through constant innovation. Meatless meat or plant-based meat products have been gaining popularity over the past few years. Consumers’ rising inclination toward trying new products and their greater health consciousness have also been driving the demand for substitutes for traditional meat products. Most plant-based food alternatives are touted to contain fewer artificial ingredients and preservatives, thus making them quite healthy. These food options are also considered a useful source of protein by people who practice vegan dining.  Industry experts believe that plant-based protein may emerge as a major disruptor in the conventional meat market. The growing demand for plant-based food, especially meat alternatives, has led many companies to invest significantly in this arena.Expansion Endeavors on Track: Companies in the industry are striving to expand their portfolio and market presence through strategic partnerships, acquisitions and capacity expansions. To this end, companies have been exploring opportunities to increase manufacturing capacity, which includes opening new manufacturing units, making expansions at existing plants and partnering with co-manufacturers. Some companies are also undertaking automation technology investments, including accelerating digitalization. Moreover, some companies, like Beyond Meat and Hormel Foods, have been focused on unlocking international potential, which is yielding favorable results.Cost Woes Persist: The increased cost of inputs remains a concern for many players in the meat food industry. Companies are witnessing a spike in the prices of raw materials, packaging and supplies, freight and logistics and labor. They have been incurring increased costs of corn, soybean meal, feed ingredients and live animals, which have been hurting margins. Several companies expect inflationary pressure to persist, which is likely to keep margins under pressure.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Food – Meat Products industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

That increased their holding by a full 62%, which arguably implies the sort of confidence required for a shy sweet-natured nerd to ask the most popular kid in the school to go out on a date. See our latest analysis for Tyson Foods Tyson Foods Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent purchase by Kevin McNamara is the biggest insider purchase of Tyson Foods shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$50.12 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the Tyson Foods insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months Tyson Foods insiders were buying shares, but not selling.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Tyson Foods insiders own 1.1% of the company, currently worth about US$200m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Tyson Foods Tell Us?It is good to see recent purchasing.

In addition to seeing chickens go without feed for up to 52 hours, the group said it documented instances of physical abuse and filthy conditions at the farm.The Associated Press could not immediately locate a contact at the farm itself. A spokesman for Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson, which processes 20% of U.S. beef, chicken and pork, denounced the conditions Animal Outlook documented in video and pictures shot at the farm and said the company ended its contract with the farm because it wasn't meeting Tyson's animal welfare standards.“Since January 2023, no Tyson Foods birds have been placed on this farm and the farmer no longer has a contract to grow for Tyson Foods,"" spokesman Derek Burleson said. “We have a longstanding commitment to the welfare, proper handling, and humane treatment and care of animals in our supply chain.”Animal Outlook's Executive Director Cheryl Leahy said Tyson should have known about the abuse sooner because the farm had been raising chickens for the meat producer for at least seven years, and the company had a manager overseeing operations there. Plus, Tyson was responsible for delivering the feed chickens went without for more than two days. Video shot by the group's investigator also shows chickens being thrown and kicked by farm workers and in at least one case a worker ripped off the head of a chicken.“There is absolutely no excuse,” Leahy said. “The day-to-day suffering of these birds is palpable in each of the videos. Still, Tyson delivered birds, year after year.”Story continuesLeahy said she believes Tyson's decision to end its contract with this farm may have been related more to its decision to shut down a processing plant in the area this spring — not animal welfare concerns.“It’s very clear that Tyson is an important part of the puzzle here, and the cruelty that we see in this investigation is systemic,” said Leahy, who cited two previous investigations her group has done at farms affiliated with Tyson.The group filed a complaint with the local district attorney asking for a criminal investigation into the way the chickens were treated that was forwarded on to the state attorney general's office.In addition to the abuse Animal Outlook found, the group said this farm failed to follow good biosecurity practices to limit the spread of disease despite the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has prompted officials to slaughter nearly 59 million chickens and turkeys to limit the spread of that virus.Animal Outlook said workers failed to sanitize their boots in bleach before they entered barns, and some of the buildings had openings that could allow wild animals to get inside. Experts believe bird flu is primarily spread by the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms.The animal rights group said its investigator also found instances of bugs in some of the chicken feed and rats in the barns where the chickens were housed.___Follow Josh Funk online at www.twitter.com/funkwrite]"

Its shareholder value-boosting measures are major positives.Synchrony — with a market cap of $12.3 billion — is a premier consumer financial services company, which offers a wide range of credit products. Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining in your portfolio at the moment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SYF’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $4.88 per share. The stock has witnessed five upward estimate revisions in the past week against seven in the opposite direction. Synchrony beat on earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 6.6%. This is depicted in the graph below.Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial Quote The consensus mark for current-year net interest income stands at $16.8 billion, suggesting a 7.8% rise from the prior-year reported number. Our estimate indicates a significant increase in interest on investment securities, which is likely to support the top-line growth.SYF’s solid CareCredit brand holds ample growth potential. The company keeps expanding the brand’s capabilities with prudent acquisitions and collaborations. This is expected to aid its Health &amp; Wellness platform, which witnessed 10.2% year-over-year growth in accounts in 2022. Our estimate for the metric in 2023 indicates a further 7.7% increase.Synchrony expects total loan receivables growth to be more than 10% for 2023 following a 14.5% increase witnessed last year. It expects quarterly operating expenses to be around $1,125 million for 2023, which will ensure that full-year expense growth remains lower than the net interest income growth. It also anticipates the net interest margin to be within 15-15.25% this year.SYF’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are noteworthy. Its dividend yield of 3.1% compares favorably with the industry average of 2.5%. Owing to its solid capital position, the company returned $500 million to shareholders through share buybacks of $400 million and dividends of $100 million, in the first quarter. Further, it had a remaining share buyback fund of $300 million at the end of March 2023.Story continuesKey RisksHowever, there are a few factors that might hinder the stock’s growth.Synchrony estimates net charge-offs for 2023 to be in the range of 4.75-5%, which suggests a significant increase from the 2022 reported figure of 3%. Also, the persisting economic volatility is forcing the company to increase the allowance for loan losses. In the first quarter, the metric rose 10% year over year. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive SYF’s growth in the long term.Key picksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are Allianz SE ALIZY, Lemonade, Inc.

Remember, the 13-Fs are released 45 days after the end of the quarter. They provide the stock purchases, and sales, of the big portfolio managers.Many managers toil away in relative obscurity, known only by their own investors. But that is not the case with the most famous value manager, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett.This quarter’s 13-F was released on May 15, after the market closed. Tracey went on Whale Wisdom, one of the popular 13-F websites, to see Berkshire’s filing, and it was so busy she couldn’t get on the page. It gave her an error message about too many users.But is it all this hype over nothing?One New BuyIt turns out, Berkshire didn’t do much with its money in Q1 in terms of buying equities. It still has $130 billion sitting there, ready to be deployed.1.       Capital One Financial (COF)Buffett added a new $1 billion position in Capital One Financial in Q1. It’s a financial company that is well known for its credit card business, but also offers auto loans, and personal and commercial banking. This is a small position for the overall portfolio.Shares of Capital One Financial are up 6.7% year-to-date but are down 13.3% over the last year. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.8.Capital One Financial pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.Did you know that Berkshire already owns two other major credit card companies?2.       Visa Corporation (V)How many know that Berkshire owns Visa? It first bought shares in the third quarter of 2011. That was good timing.Story continuesShares of Visa are up 963% since Aug 31, 2011. But the Visa position is still very small in the Berkshire portfolio. It’s just 0.58%.Why hasn’t Berkshire bought more over the years? Maybe valuation played a factor. Visa trades at 27x earnings.3.       Mastercard Inc. (MA)Did you know that Berkshire owns Mastercard as well? Berkshire bought it first, in the first quarter of 2011. It must have liked what it saw, and then bought Visa two quarters later.Mastercard is just 0.45% of the portfolio. That’s a very small position which won’t move the needle much, if at all.It’s too bad it’s so small because shares of Mastercard are up 1,479% since Feb 28, 2011. It’s been a great performer.Mastercard is even more expensive, on a P/E basis, than Visa. It’s trading at 31x. Valuation could also be the reason Buffett doesn’t add to the Mastercard position.A Surprising Sale in Q1There were several trims of various positions in Q1, including selling some of the Amazon position, but there was also one surprise sale: RH. It didn’t just trim it. It sold ALL of it. Berkshire Hathaway already owns several furniture companies. Did they just not want to own another?It was a small position in the portfolio, just 0.2%, so the shareholders won’t even notice. But it was still a surprise.4.       RH (RH)RH is a luxury lifestyle brand that sells furniture, offers interior design services and has hospitality offerings in hotels and restaurants. Berkshire first bought shares in the third quarter of 2019. It stayed committed throughout the pandemic, even on the initial stock panic.But shares of RH are down 56% the last 2 years. RH’s earnings are expected to fall 43% this year.RH also isn’t cheap. It trading with a forward P/E of 21.It will report earnings again on May 25, 2023.5.       Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM)No, Berkshire doesn’t own Williams-Sonoma, but maybe it should. It owns the top retail furniture brand in West Elm. It’s stock has also had a rough 2 years, falling 28%. But Williams-Sonoma is now cheap, with a forward P/E of 8.3. It’s earnings are also expected to fall, but only 18.8% from last year.Williams-Sonoma also pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.1%.What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About What Berkshire Is Buying and Selling?

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. FLT and WEX Inc. WEX.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2096760/5-financial-transaction-stocks-to-watch-as-digitization-gains-paceThe Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to gain on the back of the widespread uptake of digital means, leading to solid transaction volumes. A tactical merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy and tech investments enable the players to devise an advanced digital solutions suite. Resilient consumer spending, despite continued inflationary pressure, bodes well. Growing cross-border volumes resulting from a recovery in travel might boost the revenue growth of industry players. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. and WEX Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry's encouraging growth prospects.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryGrowing Digitization: The pandemic led to a widespread inclination toward adopting digital means. Amid several roadblocks thrown by the pandemic, people became aware about the convenience and affordability brought about by digital payments. A diversified set of flexible payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later solutions, mobile wallets, biometrics, to QR code utilization, came to the forefront.Story continuesThe world witnessed a higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones. Thereby, financial transaction services stocks were compelled to launch contactless payment solutions or upgrade the existing ones in order to capture a sizable share of the global digital payments market. For such growth-related initiatives, the companies frequently resort to innovative technologies, which in turn, might escalate costs. However, digital prowess is pivotal in bolstering the customer base and diversifying income streams for the industry players in the long term.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: Apart from tech investments, an active M&amp;A strategy is crucial to developing an efficient digital suite for financial transaction services companies. The pursuit of such a strategy also reflects their intensified focus on entering new markets, widening market share and attracting customers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by governments of different countries in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down.This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. An exciting year awaits, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC's Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Favorable Consumer Spending: Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market and substantial savings in hand keep the purchasing power of consumers steady amid looming fears of inflation and recession. The ease and affordability of e-commerce shopping continue to drive consumer spending growth and enable industry players to process a larger amount of transaction volumes through their card offerings. Per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending increased by $129.6 billion sequentially in the first quarter of 2023. Market and consumer data provider, Statista estimates consumer spending to witness 34.8% growth over the 2023-2028 period.Rebounding Cross-Border Travel: People are now likely to travel across the world, which can be either for recreational purposes or for business. With organizations preferring a return-to-office policy, business travel is likely to remain on an uptrend in the days ahead. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. In order to handle the growing pace of business travel, the industry players have come up with innovative business travel solutions for easier flight bookings.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #110, which places it in the top 44% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to buy or retain in your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has outperformed not only the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite but also its sector as well in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 5.9% compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.6% rally. The Zacks Business Services sector has declined 5.1% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, commonly used for valuing financial transaction services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 20.92X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 18.3X and the sector's 22.1X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 32.28X, as low as 17.68X and at the median of 25.03X.5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye on We are presenting five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

While Visa's core products drive most of its growth, it has also ventured into contactless payment solutions, such as Tap to Pay, Tokenization and Click to Pay to provide a seamless user experience. Recovery in cross-border travel coupled with stable payments volume provides an impetus to V's performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa's fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.58 per share, indicating a 14.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal-year revenues implies a 10.9% improvement from the year-ago actual. V's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 8.03%. Shares of Visa have rallied 17.9% in a year.Mastercard: Headquartered in Purchase, NY, Mastercard continues to benefit from increased travel and entertainment-related spending. MA's gross dollar volume gains on increased usage of its cards across domestic and international markets. Also, processed transactions are driven by improved consumer spending. It frequently resorts to tie-ups with local financial institutions to occupy a significant share of the worldwide digital payments market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mastercard's 2023 earnings is pegged at $12.27 per share, indicating a 15.2% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 13.1% growth from the year-ago actual. MA's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.90%. Its shares have gained 16.5% in a year.Fiserv: Based in Brookfield, WI, Fiserv's diversified product portfolio continues to yield a steady flow of customers.

The consensus mark for current-year revenues implies a 7% improvement from the year-ago actual. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has been revised 0.5% north over the past 30 days. Its shares have advanced 26.8% in a year. FLEETCOR Technologies: Based in Atlanta, GA, FLEETCOR Technologies is aided by solid organic revenue growth resulting from strength in its product categories, namely fuel, corporate payments and, tolls and lodging. Growing transaction volumes coupled with revenue retention and client acquisition efforts also act as tailwinds for the stock. Its widespread global presence enables FLT to enter new customer markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FLEETCOR Technologies' 2023 earnings is pegged at $17.06 per share, indicating a 6% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues hints at an 11.6% uptick from the year-ago actual. FLT's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 3.67%. Its shares have rallied 2.8% in a year.WEX: Headquartered in Portland, ME, WEX is being aided by an extensive fuel network and service providers, improved transaction volumes, product excellence, marketing prowess, sales force productivity and other strategic revenue generation efforts.

Acquisitions remain a key growth catalyst for WEX.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WEX's 2023 earnings is pegged at $14.04 per share, which indicates a rise of 3.8% from the 2022 figure.

170,d5885535-bb58-3184-afaf-a2e154c1681c,MA,2023-05-20,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Mastercard, McDonald's and Starbucks",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-115011978.html,1684497011,STORY,"['MA', 'SBUX', 'MCD', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – May 19, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Mastercard Inc. MA, McDonald's MCD and Starbucks' SBUX2 Mega-Cap Stocks to Buy Now and Hold ForeverThe S&amp;P 500 has climbed over 9% in 2023 and is up 7% in the past 12 months even in the face of inflation, falling earnings, a slowing economy, global geopolitical unrest, and most recently, debt-ceiling fears. It is also worth remembering that the benchmark still trades nearly 15% below its peaks, so total euphoria is far from back.The performance over the last year, which includes short-term peaks and valleys, highlights why investors with horizons of many years or even many decades are wise to stay invested and avoid too much market timing.Instead, most investors are best served buying strong, proven companies in good and bad times if they have faith in the health and stability of the U.S. economy and stock market over the long haul.If you believe in the global economic system and financial markets it is difficult to imagine that current index levels and stock prices won't look ""cheap"" five, 10, or 20 years from now—almost no matter what happens in the near term. Plus, missing the market's best days (which often occur within a few weeks of the worst days) is proven to negatively impact your returns in a very meaningful way.The bears keep waiting for the earnings outlook to turn far worse than it already has over the last year. If the wider S&amp;P 500 earnings outlook holds steady through the summer, the bulls might be proven right in saying the worst is over (the current Q2 period) when it comes to corporate profits.Meanwhile, inflation is coming down and Wall Street is betting that Jay Powell and the Fed are essentially done raising rates. Many expect the Fed to start to lower rates by the end of 2023 or early 2024.Others might be focused on all the negativity and scary headlines around the debt ceiling. But a debt-ceiling deal will almost certainly get done because the alternative could cause unimaginable damage to the economy. Biden and McCarthy echoed this sentiment recently.Story continuesHere are two mega-cap stocks from different sectors of the economy that investors might want to buy in the back half of May and hold for years and years to come.Mastercard Inc.Mastercard is a credit card powerhouse that operates an elaborate backend processing and payment network around the U.S. and globally. Mastercard essentially grabs a small percentage of the never-ending amount of credit card swipes, taps, and more that pass through its insanely complex global payment network.MA is poised to grow as the world becomes increasingly cashless. Mastercard is also actively diversifying to evolve and fight back against a wave of young and hungry fintech upstarts.Mastercard's newer efforts include the likes of cryptocurrency, buy now pay later, and other potential growth segments. MA's core credit card space remains insanely consistent and its travel-focused cross-border unit is booming again. MA currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but it topped our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates in late April, with its FY23 and FY24 earnings estimates up since then on the back of resilient consumer spending.Zacks estimates call for Mastercard's revenue to jump 13% in 2023 and over 12% higher next year to reach $28.27 billion, which would follow 18% sales growth in 2022 and 23% expansion in FY21. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge 15% this year and another 17% next year to extend a long history of impressive bottom line growth, fueled by Mastercard's high-margin business.Mastercard stock has climbed nearly 40% off its October 2022 lows, including an 11% run in 2023. MA is still trading around where it was in the summer of 2021, having moved mostly sideways over the past two years.Yet, Mastercard might be ready to break out, with it back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Plus, it completed the golden cross, where the short-term moving average climbs back above the long-term trend, at the end of 2022.MA shares touched fresh 52-week highs on Thursday. Yet, Mastercard is trading at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings to put it near its own decade-long median and at a 35% discount to its own 10-year highs. Mastercard is also trading about 9% below its average Zacks price target. And 20 of the 24 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Mastercard are ""Strong Buys"" next to three ""Buys"" and one ""Hold.""Mastercard shares have skyrocketed over 1,110% in the past 15 years to edge out Microsoft and leave the S&amp;P 500's 200% climb and the Zacks Tech Sector's 250% run in the dust. Despite all of the established fintech firms and upstarts trying to edge out Mastercard, the credit card powerhouse remains a growth machine and deeply entrenched in the economic and financial system.McDonald'sThe McDonald's brand consistently ranks in the top 10 globally alongside the likes of Apple, Disney, Nike, and others. McDonald's hasn't lost a step with older generations, while catering to younger people by rolling out digital point-of-sale kiosks, adding new on-trend menu items, and going all in on mobile ordering and delivery.In fact, the McDonald's app was downloaded 127 million times worldwide in 2022, according to Apptopia to blow away Uber Eats' 60 million, DoorDash's 42 million, and Starbucks' 34 million.McDonald's posted 10.9% global comparable sales growth in 2022, which came on top of 17% YoY expansion in the key metric in 2021. MCD's adjusted earnings climbed roughly 9% and 50%, respectively during this same stretch. The firm raised its 2023 guidance in late April on the back of higher prices and positive traffic growth, with its upbeat earnings revisions helping it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks estimates call for MCD's adjusted earnings to climb by 9% in 2023 and another 10% in FY24 on the back of 8% and 7%, respective revenue growth. Some of McDonald's bottom-line expansion can be attributed to its corporate restructuring efforts and other initiatives aimed at streamlining operations.McDonald's is a Dividend Aristocrat that's paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. MCD is up 28% in the last year and is trading well above its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.The stock has more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, while destroying Disney, Coca-Cola, Walmart and other giants of various industries. MCD's stock price sits near all-time highs, but it trades at a 15% discount to its own 10-year highs at 25.7X forward earnings.There are over 40,000 McDonald's locations across over 100 countries, with roughly 95% owned by franchisees. McDonald's customers know what they are getting when they eat at the fast-food titan, which is something Wall Street loves. And MCD shares have already cooled off substantially in recent weeks, falling back to neutral RSI levels vs. highly overbought in late April.  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

179,9b9c06a3-cb4e-3a95-a07f-9d9224c8ffed,MDT,2023-05-20,What's in the Cards for Medtronic (MDT) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-medtronic-mdt-q4-150603060.html,1684508763,STORY,"['MDT', 'HOLX', 'DVA']","[Medtronic plc MDT is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.17%. Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 0.77%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMedtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally in the form of supply chain disruption, a severe shortage of health professional labor and a record level of inflationary pressure. This continued impact of inflation with increased freight expenses is expected to have affected the fourth-quarter performance.Considering how severe the impact of inflation of raw materials and freight has been on the company’s margin in the last quarter, Medtronic, on its fiscal third-quarter earnings call, stated that it expects continued gross margin pressure in the fourth quarter and the next year. The gross margin impact is expected to have translated into a decline in the company’s adjusted operating margin this time around. However, this might have been partially muted by expense control and the benefit of the company’s currency hedging program.In such a scenario, the company has prioritized its R&amp;D investments. This might get reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter results.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteAdded to this, severe currency headwinds are expected to have affected profitability further. In this regard, on the fiscal thrid-quarter earnings call, the company noted that the fourth quarter would experience a currency headwind between $165 million and $215 million on revenues.The company, meanwhile, has been driving significant expense reduction to help offset lower revenues and continued inflation impact. Amid the macro-environmental headwinds in the form of inflation, China VBP and softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currencies, the company claims to have been laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies.Story continuesIn the to-be-reported quarter, Medtronic expects organic revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.0%, implying strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability based on new launches.The company’s Cardiovascular portfolio is expected to gain 5.5% to 6% organically in on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and LINQ II. In cardiac rhythm management, the pacing business is expected to have generated strong sales.In the neuroscience portfolio, the company's market share in Cranial and Spinal technologies is expected to have increased. Demand for the company’s new spine implants is expected to have contributed to the growth. Further, the ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of the company’s best-in-class spinal implants is expected to have contributed to the fourth-quarter top line. The Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system, particularly, are expected to have performed strongly in the to-be-reported quarter.The company earlier expected its neuroscience revenues to grow in the range of 6.5% to 7% organically in the fourth quarter.In Medical Surgical and surgical robotics, Medtronic remains focused on the limited market release of the Hugo robot while it scales production. The company recently completed Hugo installations in several geographies like Denmark, France and Italy, which are likely to have added to the company’s top-line growth within this arm. However, according to Medtronic, given increased volume-based procurement in many Chinese provinces, medical-surgical revenues are expected to be down 2.5% to 3% in the fourth quarter.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States, where Medtronic is lacking in terms of latest products due to regulatory complications. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States on the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor. According to Medtronic, overall Diabetes is expected to decline in the low single digits on an organic basis in the quarter under review.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal fourth-quarter total revenues of $8.25 billion suggests a 1.9% rise from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.56 per share implies a 2.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Medtronic this time around.

SKX as the Bull of the Day and The Mosaic Company MOS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, HP Inc. HPQ and NetApp NTAP.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Skechers U.S.A., Inc. continues to give customers what they want: great shoes. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) had record first quarter sales.Skechers designs, develops and markets lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. Its collections are available in 180 countries and territories through department and specialty stores, online, and at over 4,500 company, and third-party-owned, physical retail stores.Big Beat in the First QuarterOn Apr 27, 2023, Skechers reported its first quarter 2023 results and crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.41. It reported earnings of $1.02 versus the consensus of $0.61.It was the third beat in the last four quarters.Quarterly sales were a record, up 10% to $2 billion from $1.81 billion last year. Skechers saw broad strength in most markets globally, including regional sales improvements of 21% in both EMEA and APAC, which includes 3% growth in China.Direct-to-Consumer increased 24.5% worldwide due to improved inventory availability in stores and strong demand for its new comfort product offering.Gross margins expanded by 360 basis points to 48.9% from 45.3% last year.Inventory, which has been the bane of many retailers, fell 17.4%, or $315.8 million, to $1.5 billion from Dec 31, 2022. Inventory levels decreased in AMER, EMEA and APAC.Analysts Raise Full Year EstimatesSkechers gave 2023 earnings guidance of between $3.00 to $3.20.The analysts had been too conservative. Business is hotter than they thought. 8 estimates for 2023 have been revised higher in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus has jumped to $3.14 from $2.93, which is in the higher end of the company's guidance range.Story continuesThis is earnings growth of 31.9% over last year as the company made just $2.38.The analysts are also bullish about 2024, with 7 estimates revised higher for next year too in the last month. The 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $3.78 from $3.63. That's another 20.3% growth.Shares at 5-Year HighsIt's been a wild ride for Skechers shares. They performed well during the pandemic and hit new highs in summer of 2021 before selling off the next 12 months.But in the last year, the shares are up 41.3% and are back to those 2021 5-year highs.It's still attractively valued, with a forward P/E of 17.1.Skechers doesn't pay a dividend, but it does have a share repurchase program. During the first quarter Skechers repurchased $30 million in shares. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had approximately $395.7 million remaining in the program.If you're looking for a global retailer that has growth and is still a value, Skechers should be on your short list.Bear of the Day:The Mosaic Company is expected to see earnings decline this year after the Ukraine War spiked fertilizer prices last year. But this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is still bullish on fertilizer demand in 2023.The Mosaic Company, headquartered in Tampa, FL, is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. It supplies phosphates and potash fertilizers and feed ingredients for the global agriculture industry.Another Earnings Miss in Q1On May 3, Mosaic reported its first quarter 2023 earnings and it reported earnings of $1.14 which was a miss of 10.9%, or $0.14. The Zacks Consensus was looking for $1.28.It was the fifth earnings miss in a row.Revenue fell 8% to $3.6 billion reflecting the impact of lower prices which were somewhat offset by higher volumes.In its three big categories, volumes were higher in 2023 than in 2022. In Potash, sales volume million tonnes was 1.9 compared to 1.8 last year. In Phosphate, sales volume million tonnes was 1.8 compared to 1.7 last year and in Mosaic Fertilizantes sales volume million tonnes was 2.1 compared to 1.8.But it was the opposite in sales price.Potash MOP Selling Price fell to $421 from $582 last year. Phosphate DAP Selling Price fell to $660 from $785. Mosaic Fertilizantes finished product selling price was $646, down from $817.Gross margins fell to 18.6% from 36.7% last year.Earnings Estimates SlashedThe analysts have been aggressively cutting their earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 the last 3 months as fertilizer prices have softened.For 2023, 4 have cut the last 30 days and 1 in just the last week. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has plunged to $5.05 from $8.45 in just the last 3 months.That's an earnings decline of 54% from 2022, when it made $11.01.The cuts extend into 2024 as well. 5 estimates were cut in the last month for 2024 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.02 from $5.48 just 3 months before.That's another 20.4% drop.Mosaic Optimistic About DemandTo counter all that analyst bearishness, which is the reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is the company's industry outlook.It expects the grain and oilseed markets to remain tight through 2023 and beyond. Mosaic said in North America, sentiment has improved ""significantly"" compared to the second half of 2022.Mosaic also said spring nutrient application rates were trending toward normal levels. And for both potash and phosphates, supply constraints remain.Shares Down BigBut until earnings turn around and get raised, instead of cut, investors have decided to flee the stock. Year-to-date, shares are down 18.4%, but over the last year shares have fallen 45.5%.It's dirt cheap, even with the earnings cuts. It's trading with a forward P/E of just 7.Mosaic is also generating plenty of free cash flow. Mosaic is standing by its 2023 Capital Allocation Strategy, which is to return largely all of the 2023 free cash flow back to shareholders.In the first quarter, that meant $608 million was returned through share repurchases and dividends. It's dividend is currently yielding 2.3%.Fertilizers are a commodity. It's a challenging industry in which to invest. For investors interested in the fertilizers, and Mosaic, you may want to wait until the Zacks Rank moves higher. Keep Mosaic on your watch list.Additional content:Is NVIDIA (NVDA) Likely to Beat Q1 Earnings?NVIDIA Corp. is likely to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 24.For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues of $6.5 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.51 billion, indicating a 21.5% decline from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 92 cents per share. This suggests a year-over-year decline of 32.4%.The company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -3.2%.Let's see how things have shaped up before the announcement.Factors to ConsiderNVIDIA's first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market's last quarter results had shown early signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% sequentially in the last reported quarter. NVIDIA's Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 13% sequentially. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter for both end markets.Moreover, the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA's first-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company's Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in five of the last seven quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and artificial intelligence cockpit solutions.However, we opine that ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, like high inflation and interest rates, are likely to have continued to hurt the sales of NVIDIA's desktop workstation GPUs in the first quarter. Additionally, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented across several parts of China might have weighed on the overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVDA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate (94 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (92 cents per share), is +2.43%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Stocks with the Favorable CombinationPer our model, HP Inc. and NetApp also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.HP is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 30. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.29% at present. HP's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.1%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ's second-quarter earnings is pegged at 76 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 29.6% from the year-ago quarter's earnings of $1.11. HP's quarterly revenues are estimated to decrease 20.7% year over year to $13.07 billion.NetApp carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.22%. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 31. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTAP's fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.9%.

184,204ccdcf-b700-3758-81e9-d70be714d82d,WMB,2023-05-20,Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.4475,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-nyse-wmb-increasing-141812546.html,1684505892,STORY,['WMB'],"[The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 26th of June to $0.4475. This takes the dividend yield to 6.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies Williams Companies' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, Williams Companies' was paying out quite a large proportion of earnings and 78% of free cash flows. This indicates that the company is more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business, but we don't think that there are necessarily signs that the dividend might be unsustainable.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 1.4%. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 84% in the next 12 months, which is on the higher end of the range we would say is sustainable.historic-dividendWilliams Companies Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.25 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.79. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 3.7% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.Williams Companies May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. In the last five years, Williams Companies' earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 2.1% per annum. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Williams Companies' DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Williams Companies will make a great income stock. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Williams Companies is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Still, according to a recent CNBC article, the plunge in fossil fuel prices may bottom out soon. Further, a more significant pickup may materialize in subsequent quarters. Let’s be real – the hydrocarbon sector disappointed speculators with a series of red-splattered sessions. However, circumstances might finally change for the better for sector bulls. “Now it definitely feels like they’re at the bottom — there are multiple signs of that,” said Citi’s Global Head of Commodities Research Ed Morse. With a higher demand season on the horizon combined with geopolitical rumblings, the optimism carries credibility.If so, you might want to consider getting into “black gold” before the bullish wave. Below are seven oil stocks to buy based on their positioning in the energy value chain.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOil Stocks to Buy: Shell (SHEL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA British multinational oil and gas giant, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) ranks among the supermajors of oil stocks to buy. An integrated hydrocarbon player – meaning that it operates within all three segments of the industry’s value chain – Shell provides balanced exposure for those anticipating a sector-wide resurgence. Since the beginning of this year, SHEL gained nearly 8% of its equity value.On the financials, the company enjoys several decent (though not remarkable) stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.2%, ranking better than 53% of sector rivals. More impressively, its book growth rate during the same period comes out to 8.8%, above 71.24% of industry rivals.Also, SHEL might be undervalued. Currently, the market prices SHEL at 4.83 times free cash flow (FCF). As a discount to the underlying metric, Shell ranks better than 65.53% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg SHEL as a unanimous strong buy. Overall, their average price target is $71.74, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Story continuesOil Stocks to Buy: TotalEnergies (TTE)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA French multinational integrated energy and petroleum stalwart, TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) also ranks among the supermajors. Right now, the company carries a market capitalization of just over $150 billion. Since the start of this year, TTE slipped nearly 2%. However, in the past 365 days, it gained almost 13% of its equity value. Should hydrocarbons rise again, TTE could be one of the best oil stocks to buy.On paper, what might appeal to speculators is that TotalEnergies may be undervalued. At the moment, the market prices TTE at a forward multiple of 5.63. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 65.93% of entities listed in the oil and gas space. Also, shares trade at 5.22 times FCF. In contrast, the sector median stat is 6.67 times. Operationally, TotalEnergies gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.8%, above 67.3% of rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes out to 20.7%. Lastly, covering analysts peg TTE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $76, implying over 26% upside potential.Oil Stocks to Buy: ConocoPhillips (COP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) also ranks among the supermajors of oil stocks to buy. However, the company primarily specializes in hydrocarbon exploration and production, otherwise known as the upstream segment. Presently, ConocoPhillips carries a market cap of over $120 billion. Since the start of the year, COP lost a bit over 12% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it’s down over 3%.Still, those looking for decent value in their oil stocks may have found their ticket. According to Gurufocus, COP’s price-earnings-growth ratio pings at 0.32. In contrast, the sector median stat comes in at 0.74. Also, its enterprise-value-to-FCF ratio is 6.87. For comparison, the sector median stat is a loftier 9.5 times. Operationally, ConocoPhillips’ three-year revenue growth rate stands at 28.4%, above 83.26% of its peers. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period is 52.9%, above 83.46% of sector rivals. In closing, analysts peg COP as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $135, implying nearly 36% upside potential.Enbridge (ENB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Moving onto the midstream component – which deals with services such as storage and transportation – Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) offers a fundamentally reliable investment among oil stocks to buy. Based in Canada, Enbridge commands a massive network of pipelines that cut across North America. As of this writing, the company carries a market cap of $77.9 billion. Since the Jan. opener, ENB lost very roughly 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down over 12%.Now, financially, it must be said that Enbridge isn’t exactly the most confidence-inspiring of oil stocks. On paper, it seems overvalued. Further, on the sales front, it’s not exactly blowing the doors off the competition. At the same time, Enbridge enjoys consistent profitability. As a major midstream player, it’s vital to the broader stability of North America’s energy infrastructure. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg ENB as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target lands at $45.36, implying 18% upside potential.Williams (WMB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Williams (NYSE:WMB) its core business centers on natural gas processing and transportation. Per its public profile, the company also features petroleum and electricity generation assets. Therefore, WMB ranks among the oil stocks on the periphery. Right now, the underlying enterprise carries a market cap of just under $36 billion. Since the January opener, WMB lost 9% of its equity value.As with Enbridge above, Williams doesn’t exactly offer the most confidence-inspiring financials. Instead, the core of its investment proposition centers on the pertinence of its midstream operations. That said, it’s not totally bereft of tangible statistics. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.9%, which ranks better than 54.38% of its peers. For profitability, its trailing-year net margin is 22.53%, above 74.9% of the competition.Looking to the Street, analysts peg WMB as a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $36.85, implying nearly 26% upside potential.Valero Energy (VLO)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

Specifically, Valero focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels, other petrochemical products, and power. Since the Jan. opener, VLO lost 8% of its equity value.According to Gurufocus, Valero might be modestly undervalued, potentially attracting speculators of oil stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices VLO at a forward multiple of 5.03.

On average, their price target lands at $158.27, implying over 43% upside potential.HF Sinclair (DINO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA diversified energy firm, HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) manufactures and sells products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, renewable diesel, and specialty lubricant products, among others. Should higher energy prices hit the economy, HF Sinclair could cynically benefit from the captive audience framework. Presently, it features a market cap of $7.7 billion. It’s one of the riskiest oil stocks to buy, shedding over 19% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, DINO could be intriguing for those seeking a discount. Right now, the market prices DINO at a forward multiple of 4.83. As a discount to projected earnings, HF Sinclair ranks better than 73.82% of the industry. Also, it trades at 0.22 times trailing sales.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Managed by Renaissance Technologies, the Medallion Fund stands as one of the world's most prosperous and enigmatic hedge funds. Established in 1988 by mathematician Jim Simons, the fund has consistently generated remarkable returns for its investors, earning a reputation for employing mathematical models and algorithms to conduct trading activities within the financial markets. With a current net worth of approximately $28 billion, Simons directs his attention beyond the daily trading of stocks and other financial assets. The unique approach employed by Simons and his former colleagues at Renaissance has yielded unprecedented annualized returns. During the March quarter, fund managers focused their attention on the U.S. financial sector, which experienced significant volatility as a result of the severe banking crisis, reminiscent of the 2008 financial meltdown. According to Reuters, securities filings released for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that Renaissance Technologies was one of the notable funds that invested in First Republic Bank. Renaissance Technologies acquired around 7.1 million shares of the bank during the first quarter and retained ownership of them until March 31, when they were valued at $13.99 per share.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies also significantly increased its investment in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) during the fourth quarter of 2022. Their holdings of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock grew by 18% to reach 4 million shares. The firm also acquired nearly 1.8 million shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), resulting in a stake worth $749,000 as of the end of March 2023. However, in this article, we discuss the top 15 stocks to buy and hold according to Jim Simons’ hedge fund, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Story continuesOur Methodology For this list, we selected top 15 stocks from the Q1 2023 13F portfolio of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesBillionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top Stock Picks15. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $485,381,000Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) offers a comprehensive communications platform across various regions, including the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Their service, Zoom Meetings, enables users to engage in high-definition video, voice, chat, and content sharing on a wide range of devices such as mobile devices, computers, telephones, and conference room systems. In Q1 2023, Simons’ fund owned 6.5 million shares of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) worth $6.5 million, representing 0.64% of the total 13F securities. According to Needham analyst Ryan Koontz, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is expected to benefit from Microsoft's reported decision to separate Teams from Office. On April 24, the analyst maintained a Hold rating on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), stating that Teams has become a prominent collaboration platform for enterprises. The unbundling of Teams from Office increases the analyst's confidence in Zoom's ability to achieve a consensus growth rate of 5% in its fiscal year 2025. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q4 2022, 36 funds were long Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $719 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is one of the top stock picks of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. Here is what Horos Asset Management had to say about Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”14. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,125,000The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) operates as a food and drug retailer in the United States. Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed that Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies owned more than 10 million shares of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) worth $495 million, representing 0.65% of the total portfolio. On March 20, Northcoast analyst Chuck Cerankosky raised the rating on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) from Neutral to Buy and set a price target of $60. The stock has declined to the mid-$40 range due to the company's announcement of its intention to acquire Albertsons. However, the analyst believes that since the transaction is still a considerable time away, investors should instead focus on the value of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) stock based on its own strengths. This was demonstrated in the company's recently released fourth-quarter results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 50 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Oakmark Fund made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,718,000Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global company engaged in the research, development, production, marketing, distribution, and sale of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. In Q1 2023, Jim Simons’ fund owned more than 12 million shares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) worth $495.7 million, representing 0.65% of the total 13F portfolio. Renaissance Technologies increased its stake in the company by 1034% in Q1. On April 26, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 9, to shareholders of record on May 12. Barclays analyst Carter Gould on May 3 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $43 following the Q1 results. The analyst anticipates a difficult situation for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in the upcoming summer months, as the effects of COVID and new product launches are expected to have a greater impact in the later part of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared to 77 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 9.8 million shares worth $502.7 million. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”12. United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $498,852,000United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR) is a biotechnology company that focuses on developing and bringing to market innovative products to meet the medical needs of patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening diseases.

The revenue of $506.9 million increased 9.7% on a year-over-year basis, missing market consensus by $7.47 million.Ladenburg analyst Matthew Kaplan on May 4 maintained a Buy rating on United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $256 from $285 following the Q1 results. The decision to trim the price target is primarily attributed to updated revenue projections specifically related to treprostinil-based products, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 49 hedge funds were bullish on United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR), compared to 47 funds in the earlier quarter. Kurt Von Emster’s VenBio Select Advisor is the biggest position holder in the company. 11. Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $506,437,000Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) specializes in royalties and streaming related to gold. They primarily operate in Latin America, the United States, Canada, and other international markets. In the first quarter of 2023, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies owned 3.47 million shares of Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), worth $506.4 million and representing 0.67% of the total 13F securities. On May 4, H.C. Wainwright analyst Heiko Ihle has increased the firm's price target on Franco-Nevada to $180 from $145 and maintained a Buy rating on the company's shares. The decision to raise the target price is based on recent market multiples and is influenced by Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) Q1 results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 27 hedge funds were bullish on Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), compared to 28 funds in the earlier quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.11 million shares worth $288.6 million. Here is what Horizon Kinetics has to say about Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back to basic principles. We don’t hold gold in client portfolios, we hold gold royalty companies. The two have surprisingly little in common. The gold royalty company generates very impressive profits even if the gold price never rises, and it earns those profits year after year. Here is a long-term chart of Franco Nevada Corp., the premier gold royalty company vs. gold itself: a comparable gold price today than a decade ago, yet Franco Nevada returned 12.5% annually, matching the S&amp;P 500 return, despite its nearsole source of revenues unchanged.

However, the company plans to focus its capital on higher-margin businesses, the analyst stated in the research note to investors.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 66 funds in the prior quarter. Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”9.

Current airframe production is running materially below expected travel demand over the next 5-10 years, creating a structural supply/demand imbalance that we believe will drive a decade of strong growth in civil aerospace from here. In our 2Q’22 correspondence, we described the attributes of our ideal growth ballast and said we hoped to convert another in the coming months – we believe Boeing checks all those boxes.”8.

The company’s stock price had fallen roughly 17% from its peak in October 2021 on fears about Medicare reimbursement rates, and we used this dislocation to start purchasing shares of what we believe to be the most dominant and complete managed care company in the industry.With several at-scale and interconnected businesses, UNH occupies a unique position within the U.S. healthcare system. UnitedHealth has (a) a dominant managed care organization in commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets, (b) a large and growing presence in local care delivery (OptumHealth’s physicians and ambulatory service centers), (c) one of only three at scale pharmacy benefits managers (OptumRx’s PBM) and (d) a fast-growing healthcare information technology (HCIT), consulting and revenue cycle management (RCM) business (OptumInsight). The combination of the largest MCO (UnitedHealth) with the faster-growing, higher-margin Optum services businesses positions the company to capture a large portion of the future growth opportunities in the U.S. healthcare services industry. We expect balanced growth from both health insurance and health services leading to consistent high-single-digit revenue growth for the company. With margin expansion from scale, share buybacks from its strong cash generating ability (the company currently has $30 billion in net cash), and continued strategic acquisitions, we believe the company can generate mid-teens or better earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UNH shares were down slightly from where we re-initiated a position during the quarter, causing them to be a top detractor (-0.02%) in an overall strong quarter where few positions were down.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Quantum Computing Companies in the World10 Least Digitized Industries That Are Ripe for Digital Transformation15 Best Countries for Americans to Live in Europe Disclosure: None.

Despite being 87 years old, he is still very active in the market. His latest target is Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), a genomics company which he recently launched a proxy battle against.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ILMN. Click here to check it out. ILMN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ILMNPeter Lynch Chart of ILMNIn this discussion, I will break down this battle with Illumina and determine whether or not Icahn can generate greater value for shareholders.What does Illumina do?Illumina is a leading DNA sequencing company. Headquartered in San Diego, its main products focus on gene sequencing by synthesis, which involves breaking the DNA molecule into smaller segments in order to create a DNA library or blueprint.Now this is not just for scientific curiosity, as there are many real-world benefits, including the ability to predict which genetic diseases an individual is prone to and tailor treatment accordingly. In extreme cases, this technology could be used to identify which genes would cause a genetic-based disease and remove them before a child is born, effectively creating so-called designer babies.Why this could be a game changerOften, great technology has a tipping point into mainstream adoption once its costs fall below a certain level. This is exactly what we are seeing in the gene sequencing industry.After being launched in 1990, The Human Genome Project took 13 years and a staggering $2.7 billion to complete. In 2007, a pioneer in the DNA sequencing space, James Watson, was the first person to get his genome sequenced for slightly less than $1 million. However, since that point, the cost of gene sequencing has fallen to just $200. Illumina has a new machine that aims to bring the cost down to as low as $100.This is a game changer as it effectively means the total addressable market for gene sequencing could be expanded to virtually everyone on the planet in a best-case scenario.Story continuesGrandview Research says base industry reports indicate the genomics industry is worth a staggering $28 billion today and is forecasted to grow to $95 billion in value by 2030.Icahn battles Illumina Given Illuminas prime position in the DNA sequencing industry and the aforementioned tailwinds, one would expect its share price to be booming. However, since August 2021, its stock has been hammered by nearly 60%.Carl Icahn Dives Into Activist Investment IlluminaIcahn believes this is partially due to poor management and has launched a proxy battle as a result.In the first quarter of 2023, the activist investor purchased 430,000 shares of Illumina, which traded for an average price of $210 each.According to my estimates, this gives Icahn less then 1% ownership of the company, which is hardly enough for a takeover. However, this has not stopped him from writing a series of open letters to shareholders. In these letters, Icahn discusses the value destruction and heavy volume of complaints against the company's current management team.In one specific case, Icahn references the example of Illumina spinning off Grail in 2016, which aimed to focus on developing blood tests for early-stage cancer. The strange thing, in this case, was Illumina then reacquired the company in 2021 for approximately $7 billion dollars. If things could not get any more controversial, in April, the Federal Trade Commission overturned a judge's decision to approve the deal and Illumina has been ordered to unwind it, according to Bloomberg.The real question on shareholders' minds is: Did insiders make any substantial sum from spinning off Grail and then reacquiring it?According to an estimate by NONGAAP Investing, a specialist in corporate governance, this value could have been between $500 million and $1 billion, which is substantial.In Icahns letter, he points to the lack of transparency exhibited by Illumina CEO Francis deSouza and the incumbent directors.Icahn even went as far as to suggest a law firm or forensic accounting team should investigate. He referenced the largest shareholders, which include Vanguard, Blackrock and Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio), and suggested they demand an immediate and transparent inquiry.In order the solve the governance issue, Icahn has launched a director contest and urged shareholders to vote. This would include replacing three of Illuminas incumbent directors with individuals Icahn believes to be ""more qualified, independent and motivated.""Challenged financials Illumina reported mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Its revenue of $1.09 billion declined by approximately 11% year over year, but still beat analysts' forecasts by $20.68 million. However, this decline is a far cry from the strong growth rates of over 77% reported in 2021.Carl Icahn Dives Into Activist Investment IlluminaThe company also accomplished key product milestones, which included the shipping of its anticipated NovaSeq X systems and its complete long read technology. These products strengthen Illumina's position with regard to high throughput genome sequencing.The orders for its NovaSeq X series reached over 200 from a diverse international customer base, of which approximately 40% were derived from clinics.Its Genetic Disease Testing segment also performed well, with shipments growing by 7% year over year.Many health insurance companies are also moving toward including genome sequencing as part of their policy, which should act as a strong tailwind for Illumina. For instance, in the first quarter, Managed Medicaid added 3.8 million people with whole genome sequencing coverage.Illuminas revenue was held back by a 19% decline in its consumables shipments related to Covid-19 surveillance. Overall, China-based revenue fell by 28% year over year to $91 million, which was driven by the hard lockdown disruptions.Moving on to earnings, the company reported a $65 million loss in operating income, which was worse than the positive $135 million reported in the prior-year quarter.A positive is management has announced plans to reduce its expenses by over $100 million in 2023. This is expected to boost its non-GAAP operating margin to 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025, which would be fantastic.Carl Icahn Dives Into Activist Investment IlluminaThe business still has a robust balance sheet to continue to invest with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Illumina does have total debt of $3 billion, but is manageable due to around $1.5 billion of it being long-term debt.ValuationIllumina trades with a price-sales ratio of 7, which is 45% cheaper than its five-year average.Carl Icahn Dives Into Activist Investment IlluminaThe GF Value LIne indicates a fair value of $382 per share based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnins projections. Thus, the stock is undervalued at the time of writing.Carl Icahn Dives Into Activist Investment IlluminaGuru interestAs mentioned, Illumina traded at an average price of $210 per share during the quarter, which is slightly cheaper than where the stock traded at the time of writing.Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio)'s Bridgewater Associates also bought 3,415 shares at a similar level, as did Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) and Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio).One of Illuminas largest shareholders, Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio), trimmed its position by around 10%.Final thoughts Illumina has an immense market opportunity and its technology for gene sequencing is best in class. The only issue could be its management, which Icahn aims to oust in his usual confrontational style. If shareholders vote for Icahns suggested candidates, this has the potential to unlock greater shareholder value.In the short term, however, I do expect a rocky road, so investors should expect quite a ride.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

After all, persistently high mortgage rates and home prices, coupled with concerns around inflation, bank sector chaos, weakening economic growth, and a very real possibility of recession have kept a lot of potential homebuyers on the fence. Granted, median existing home sales fell about 0.9% year over year, which is the second consecutive month of declines. However, total existing home sales are down about 22% year-over-year. With that, we’re likely to see additional housing price fluctuations.Notably, “If current economic conditions persist, with elevated mortgage rates and home prices amid scarce inventory, the market is likely in for a long, slow climb and a few bumps along the way,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, as noted by Forbes.com.While most of the housing market will remain a tough place to invest in for the foreseeable future, there are still some housing stocks that may prove resilient.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLook at apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs), for example. Sky-high home prices and mortgage rates pushing down affordability, boosting demand for rentals. For example, according to Robb Report, the number of households rented by people making $150,000 or more increased to three million between 2016 and 2021. That’s an 87% jump in just five years. And while rents are on the rise, many are better off financially if they hold off on buying until home prices cool off.That makes housing stocks, such as apartment REITs even more attractive.EQREquity Residential$62.24AVBAvalonBay Communities$178.11MAAMid-American Apartment Communities$151.40Equity Residential (EQR)Woman hands holding home model, small miniature white toy house. Mortgage property insurance dream moving home and real estate concept. Case-Shiller, housing market.Source: David Gyung / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 4.2%, Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) is one of the largest multifamily REITs on the market. It has about 301 properties spread across the U.S., including 79,351 rental units. What’s impressive here is that EQR just had another strong quarter, with normalized funds from operations (FFO) growing 13% year-over-year. These metrics were driven by stronger leasing trends. Even same-store revenue was up 9.2% year-over-year, thanks to higher demand.Story continuesAnalysts like EQR are here, too. Piper Sandler, for example, just raised its price target to $63 from $59, with an underweight rating. The firm added that “Earnings show apartments are more durable than anticipated following the post-pandemic rent hikes and corporate layoffs.”AvalonBay Communities (AVB)Instability In Real Estate Market, housing market crashSource: Romolo Tavani / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 3.7%, AvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) is another hot apartment REIT to consider.Currently, AVB holds about 295 apartment communities with 88,826 apartment homes in 12 states. Just as impressive, AVB had a solid quarter, with a 13.4% gain in FFO per share. Same-store total revenue was also up 9.4% to $629.9 million.And while its focus has been in high-cost areas like New York and Los Angeles, it’s expanding into the South Florida, North Carolina, and Texas markets. Plus, with apartment demand as strong as it is, AVB should continue to grow its rental income, and maybe even increase its yield.Piper Sandler raised its price target on AVB to $193 from $160. Just as we saw with EQR, earnings show apartment rentals are still far more durable than other real estate asset classes right now.Mid-American Apartment Communities (MAA)Real estate growth graph, housing marketSource: bluebay / Shutterstock.comThere’s also the Mid-American Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) REIT. With a yield of 3.65%, MAA has a portfolio of 300 apartment communities, with 102,000 rental units.The REIT, which has been public-traded for about 28 years now, has paid out 117 consecutive quarterly cash dividends. It’s also raised its dividend every year for the last 13 years. Better, its Q1 FFO came in at $2.28, a three-cent beat. Revenue, up 11.1% year over year to $52.9.03 million, beat by $630,000.Plus, as noted by Seeking Alpha, “Higher interest rates benefit MAA, as higher mortgage payments resulted in some buyers being priced out of single-family homes, resulting in stickier demand for MAA’s apartment communities. This is reflected by occupancy remaining stable at 95.5%.”On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.84 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.36. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that TE Connectivity has grown earnings per share at 15% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that TE Connectivity is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings.

Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.We Really Like Northrop Grumman's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Corporation VFC is likely to register top and bottom-line decreases from the year-ago quarter’s reported figures when it posts fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on May 23, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.74 billion, indicating a 2.9% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at 14 cents per share, suggesting a 68.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Earnings estimates have remained unchanged in the past 30 days. We expect fiscal fourth-quarter net revenues to decline 3.4% year over year to $2.7 billion and the bottom line to plunge 75.8% to 11 cents a share.For fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $11.6 billion, suggesting a 1.9% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates a 34.9% year-over-year decline to $2.07. We expect the company’s fiscal 2023 total revenues to decrease 2% year over year to $11.6 billion and the bottom line to decline 35.6% to $2.05V.F.

Corporation Price and EPS Surprise V.F. Corporation price-eps-surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteV.F. Corp has been gaining from its Supreme buyout and cost-saving efforts. It is on track with a strategic review of its Global Packs business, consisting of the Kipling, Eastpak and JanSport brands, as well as the divestiture and leaseback of its Europe headquarters in Stabio, Switzerland. VFC has been focused on lowering working capital and optimizing inventories.The company has been benefiting from Supreme’s strong follower base in the younger generation, even when consumers are moving away from apparel to essential spending.  Management, in its last earnings report, noted that the fall/winter season started on a solid note. The brand’s newly launched Yoji-Yamamoda collection, the Nike ACG release as well as the Andre 3000 Poster campaign bode well.However, V.F. Corp continues to reel under a tough operating environment and continued supply-chain headwinds. The company has been witnessing higher lead times across the supply chain which should have affected business in the quarter under review. Also, increased volatility on the distribution and logistics front, particularly in the Americas, is likely to have acted as a deterrent.The company’s China business has been facing logistics-related issues causing ongoing product delays due to impacts from the country’s eight-week lockdown during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Currently, China has been witnessing sequential improvement as it reopens but the lower consumer spending remains a concern.On its last earnings report, the company expected fiscal 2023 constant dollar revenue growth of 3%, down from earlier mention of 5-6%. Vans brand revenue for the fiscal year was anticipated to be down in the high-single digits, compared with the prior mentioned mid-single digits.VFC forecasted the gross margin to decline 200 bps year over year, compared with the prior mentioned decline of 100-150 bps. Adjusted operating margin was envisioned to be 9.5%, down from the earlier mentioned 11%. V.F. Corp predicted adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.05-$2.15, compared with $2.40-$2.50 stated earlier.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for V.F.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has lost 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share, indicating a change of +71.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.79 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.6%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.75 indicates a change of -0.7% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +18.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.31 billion and $78.47 billion estimates indicate +8.8% and -2.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $20.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.96%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This initiative highlights the impacts of climate change on the financial health of individuals earning less than $50,000 per year. With support from the Wells Fargo Foundation, Saverlife will publish a series of reports that identify how individuals with low-to-moderate income are currently navigating climate-related events, as well as determine how well existing policies to mitigate climate change support them.SaverLife reaches more than 600,000 members across the country working to achieve financial stability and build wealth. Through its financial technology platform, SaverLife provides members with financial content, savings rewards and incentives, online community support, and opportunities to engage with research efforts and policy work.""Climate change is a major threat to the financial well-being of all Americans, but the impacts are disproportionately felt by those living paycheck to paycheck,"" said Leigh Phillips, President and CEO of SaverLife. ""If we are to ensure families can navigate both weather related disasters and the increasing chronic financial stressors associated with a warming planet, we must first understand how households are experiencing these challenges today and work together to design solutions that are inclusive of everyone.""The initiative will leverage a panel of advisors from across the climate, community organizing, and financial health fields. Project advisors will include representation from organizations such as Inclusiv, NRDC, NEADA, the University of Michigan, and the Greenlining Institute. It will also generate actionable recommendations that the financial sector can use to better support low-to-moderate income households as they adapt to climate change.Story continues""Wells Fargo is pleased to support financial health and resiliency in our communities through The Downpour initiative with our partners SaverLife,"" said Robyn Luhning, chief sustainability officer at Wells Fargo.

215,914698e7-c98a-31c4-b7e7-3a09443b17f5,WFC,2023-05-20,Those who invested in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) three years ago are up 70%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-wells-fargo-nyse-140025373.html,1684332025,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 20% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been pleasing. To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 60% during that period.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Wells Fargo achieved compound earnings per share growth of 5.9% per year. In comparison, the 17% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Wells Fargo's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Wells Fargo's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Wells Fargo the TSR over the last 3 years was 70%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.8% in the last year, Wells Fargo shareholders lost 9.7% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The committee believes the available data supports the efficacy and safety of the RSV vaccine. The committee voted 10 to 4 on safety and 14 to 0 on effectiveness.The vaccine candidate is under FDA review for preventing medically attended lower respiratory tract disease (MA-LRTD) and severe MA-LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. Adecision from the FDA is expected in August.The VRBPAC’s positive vote was based on primary analysis results from the pivotal phase III study called MATISSE on the candidate.Pfizer’s BLA seeking approval of the RSV vaccine for older adults (aged 60 and above) is also under priority review, with the FDA decision expected later this month. The VRBPAC also voted in favor of the RSV vaccine for older adults in February 2023. The vaccine candidate is also under review for both older adults and maternal immunization in Europe.Pfizer’s stock has declined 30.5% in the past year against an increase of 9.3% for the industry.Until a year back there were no FDA-approved vaccines against RSV infections anywhere in the world. Early this month, the FDA approved GSK’s GSK RSV vaccine, Arexvy forthe prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in older adults. This was the first RSV vaccine for older adults to be approved anywhere in the world. Older adults, young infants and people with some chronic medical conditions are at maximum risk to get LRTI-RSV disease.GSK’s RSV vaccine is under review in Japan and Europe as well. In April, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending approval of the vaccine. A final European regulatory decision is expected soon.Story continuesAstraZeneca AZN and Sanofi’s SNY RSV vaccine called Beyfortus/nirsevimab was approved in Europe for protection against LRTI caused by RSV in newborns and infants in November 2022. A similar application is under review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in the third quarter of this year.  The approval for Beyfortus was based on data from the MELODY phase III and other phase IIb studies conducted jointly by AstraZeneca and Sanofi.If approved, Pfizer’s vaccine will be the first maternal immunization vaccine to be approved to help protect infants at first breath through their first six months of life from RSV disease in the United States.Moderna is also developing an mRNA vaccine, mRNA-1345, targeting RSV in a phase III study, ConquerRSV, in older adults. The study met the primary efficacy endpoints, per top-line data announced in January. Based on these results, Moderna expects to file for regulatory approval. The company is also evaluating mRNA-1345 in an early-stage study in pediatric populations.Pfizer currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It is already approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, axial spondyloarthropathy and ulcerative colitis in certain patients in several countries.FDA Committee Votes in Favor of Pfizer’s RSV Vaccine for Maternal Immunization: Pfizer announced that the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) has voted in favor of its RSV bivalent vaccine candidate PF-06928316 or RSVpreF to help prevent RSV in infants through maternal immunization.

Pfizer’s BLA seeking approval of the RSV vaccine for older adults (aged 60 and above) is already under priority review, with the FDA decision expected later this month. The VRBPAC had also voted in favor of the RSV vaccine for older adults in February 2023. The vaccine candidate is also under review for both older adults and maternal immunization in Europe.Story continuesPfizer is planning a debt offering worth $31 billion to fund its pending acquisition of cancer drugmaker, Seagen SGEN. In March, Pfizer offered to buy Seagen for $229 per share in cash, which adds up to a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. Seagen’s acquisition is expected to strengthen Pfizer’s portfolio of cancer drugs by adding a class of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).The bond sale is probably one of the largest debt offerings of all time. The debt offering, which will consist of eight tranches of notes, is expected to be closed on May 19. Pfizer said that BofA Securities, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as the joint lead managers and joint book-running managers.Roche’s BTK inhibitor, Fenebrutinib Meets Goals in Multiple Sclerosis Study: Roche’s data from a phase II study showed that BTK inhibitor fenebrutinib significantly reduced brain lesions in adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The phase II FENopta study met its primary endpoint by reducing the total number of new gadolinium-enhancing T1 brain lesions, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study also met its key secondary endpoint by significantly reducing the total number of new or enlarging T2 brain lesions compared to placebo. T1 lesions are a marker of active inflammation while T2 lesions represent the amount of lesion load.FDA’s Fast Track Status to Bayer’s Stroke Prevention Candidate: The FDA granted fast track designation to Bayer’s oral FXIa inhibitor, asundexian (BAY2433334) as a potential treatment option for stroke prevention and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation (AF).

(PFE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-trending-stock-130001814.html,1684501201,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned -8.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -68.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.1%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.34 indicates a change of -0.2% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -49.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $67.71 billion and $66.55 billion estimates indicate -32.5% and -1.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Managed by Renaissance Technologies, the Medallion Fund stands as one of the world's most prosperous and enigmatic hedge funds. Established in 1988 by mathematician Jim Simons, the fund has consistently generated remarkable returns for its investors, earning a reputation for employing mathematical models and algorithms to conduct trading activities within the financial markets. With a current net worth of approximately $28 billion, Simons directs his attention beyond the daily trading of stocks and other financial assets. The unique approach employed by Simons and his former colleagues at Renaissance has yielded unprecedented annualized returns. During the March quarter, fund managers focused their attention on the U.S. financial sector, which experienced significant volatility as a result of the severe banking crisis, reminiscent of the 2008 financial meltdown. According to Reuters, securities filings released for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that Renaissance Technologies was one of the notable funds that invested in First Republic Bank. Renaissance Technologies acquired around 7.1 million shares of the bank during the first quarter and retained ownership of them until March 31, when they were valued at $13.99 per share.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies also significantly increased its investment in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) during the fourth quarter of 2022. Their holdings of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock grew by 18% to reach 4 million shares. The firm also acquired nearly 1.8 million shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), resulting in a stake worth $749,000 as of the end of March 2023. However, in this article, we discuss the top 15 stocks to buy and hold according to Jim Simons’ hedge fund, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Story continuesOur Methodology For this list, we selected top 15 stocks from the Q1 2023 13F portfolio of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesBillionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top Stock Picks15. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $485,381,000Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) offers a comprehensive communications platform across various regions, including the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Their service, Zoom Meetings, enables users to engage in high-definition video, voice, chat, and content sharing on a wide range of devices such as mobile devices, computers, telephones, and conference room systems. In Q1 2023, Simons’ fund owned 6.5 million shares of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) worth $6.5 million, representing 0.64% of the total 13F securities. According to Needham analyst Ryan Koontz, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is expected to benefit from Microsoft's reported decision to separate Teams from Office. On April 24, the analyst maintained a Hold rating on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), stating that Teams has become a prominent collaboration platform for enterprises. The unbundling of Teams from Office increases the analyst's confidence in Zoom's ability to achieve a consensus growth rate of 5% in its fiscal year 2025. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q4 2022, 36 funds were long Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $719 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is one of the top stock picks of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. Here is what Horos Asset Management had to say about Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”14. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,125,000The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) operates as a food and drug retailer in the United States. Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed that Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies owned more than 10 million shares of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) worth $495 million, representing 0.65% of the total portfolio. On March 20, Northcoast analyst Chuck Cerankosky raised the rating on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) from Neutral to Buy and set a price target of $60. The stock has declined to the mid-$40 range due to the company's announcement of its intention to acquire Albertsons. However, the analyst believes that since the transaction is still a considerable time away, investors should instead focus on the value of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) stock based on its own strengths. This was demonstrated in the company's recently released fourth-quarter results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 50 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Oakmark Fund made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,718,000Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global company engaged in the research, development, production, marketing, distribution, and sale of biopharmaceutical products worldwide.

(NYSE:PFE) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $43 following the Q1 results. The analyst anticipates a difficult situation for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in the upcoming summer months, as the effects of COVID and new product launches are expected to have a greater impact in the later part of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared to 77 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 9.8 million shares worth $502.7 million. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”12. United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $498,852,000United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR) is a biotechnology company that focuses on developing and bringing to market innovative products to meet the medical needs of patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening diseases.

The decision to trim the price target is primarily attributed to updated revenue projections specifically related to treprostinil-based products, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 49 hedge funds were bullish on United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR), compared to 47 funds in the earlier quarter. Kurt Von Emster’s VenBio Select Advisor is the biggest position holder in the company. 11.

Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.11 million shares worth $288.6 million. Here is what Horizon Kinetics has to say about Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back to basic principles. We don’t hold gold in client portfolios, we hold gold royalty companies. The two have surprisingly little in common. The gold royalty company generates very impressive profits even if the gold price never rises, and it earns those profits year after year. Here is a long-term chart of Franco Nevada Corp., the premier gold royalty company vs. gold itself: a comparable gold price today than a decade ago, yet Franco Nevada returned 12.5% annually, matching the S&amp;P 500 return, despite its nearsole source of revenues unchanged. What will Franco Nevada’s earnings and share price do if gold rises over the course of a decade?”10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $526,124,000Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of Jim Simons’ top stock picks as of the first quarter of 2023.

Chevron also intends to continue expanding various new energy initiatives, including a significant carbon capture project at Bayou Bend. However, the company plans to focus its capital on higher-margin businesses, the analyst stated in the research note to investors.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 66 funds in the prior quarter. Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%.

Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth $250.2 million. Jackson Square Partners made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“For The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)–in short, we believe the worst of Boeing’s idiosyncratic issues are behind it, the airframe duopoly remains as protected as ever, and at current prices (where we’ve been adding), the stock is trading around ~6x FCF on 2025E. Current airframe production is running materially below expected travel demand over the next 5-10 years, creating a structural supply/demand imbalance that we believe will drive a decade of strong growth in civil aerospace from here. In our 2Q’22 correspondence, we described the attributes of our ideal growth ballast and said we hoped to convert another in the coming months – we believe Boeing checks all those boxes.”8.

The company’s stock price had fallen roughly 17% from its peak in October 2021 on fears about Medicare reimbursement rates, and we used this dislocation to start purchasing shares of what we believe to be the most dominant and complete managed care company in the industry.With several at-scale and interconnected businesses, UNH occupies a unique position within the U.S. healthcare system. UnitedHealth has (a) a dominant managed care organization in commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets, (b) a large and growing presence in local care delivery (OptumHealth’s physicians and ambulatory service centers), (c) one of only three at scale pharmacy benefits managers (OptumRx’s PBM) and (d) a fast-growing healthcare information technology (HCIT), consulting and revenue cycle management (RCM) business (OptumInsight). The combination of the largest MCO (UnitedHealth) with the faster-growing, higher-margin Optum services businesses positions the company to capture a large portion of the future growth opportunities in the U.S. healthcare services industry. We expect balanced growth from both health insurance and health services leading to consistent high-single-digit revenue growth for the company. With margin expansion from scale, share buybacks from its strong cash generating ability (the company currently has $30 billion in net cash), and continued strategic acquisitions, we believe the company can generate mid-teens or better earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UNH shares were down slightly from where we re-initiated a position during the quarter, causing them to be a top detractor (-0.02%) in an overall strong quarter where few positions were down.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Quantum Computing Companies in the World10 Least Digitized Industries That Are Ripe for Digital Transformation15 Best Countries for Americans to Live in Europe Disclosure: None.

Shares have lost about 0.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IBM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.IBM Beats on Q1 Earnings, Revenues Miss Despite Cloud DemandIBM reported relatively healthy first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed healthy demand for hybrid cloud and AI solutions with a client-focused portfolio and broad-based growth. However, despite top-line improvement on a year-over-year basis, revenues lagged the consensus estimate.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $934 million or $1.02 per share compared with $662 million or 73 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line growth and lower operating expenses.Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $1.36 per share compared with $1.40 per share in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents.Quarter DetailsQuarterly total revenues increased to $14,252 million from $14,197 million on strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4.4% year over year. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $14,274 million.Gross profit was $7,509 million compared with $7,335 million in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 52.7% and 51.7% owing to a strong portfolio mix. Total expenses decreased to $6,451 million from $6,712 million, driven by improvements in the business mix and ongoing productivity initiatives.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceSoftware: Revenues improved to $5,921 million from $5,772 million, driven by growth in Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat and Transaction Processing. Segment pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1,164 million compared with $1,134 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 19.7% each. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation, data in AI and security.Consulting: Revenues were $4,962 million, up from $4,829 million, led by pervasive growth driven by demand for digital transformation, growing revenues and signings at double-digit rates across all business lines and regions. Segment pre-tax income was $382 million compared with $348 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by productivity enhancement initiatives for respective margins of 7.7% and 7.2%.Infrastructure: Revenues were $3,098 million, down from $3,219 million, as healthy demand for zSystems was more than offset by lower demand for Distributed Infrastructure and support services. Segment pre-tax income was $216 million compared with $199 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 7% and 6.2%.Financing: Revenues improved to $196 million from $154 million. Segment pre-tax income was $100 million compared with $84 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 51.3% and 54.6%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityDuring the first quarter, IBM generated $3,774 million in cash from operations compared with $3,248 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was $1,340 million in the quarter, up from $1,240 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher profit and working capital efficiencies. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $9,337 million in cash and cash equivalents with $53,826 million of long-term debt.OutlookFor full-year 2023, the company expects 3-5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Free cash flow is estimated to be approximately $10.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -7.48% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, IBM has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

228,08247598-6ad4-38db-b81e-464ca8fc7d88,IBM,2023-05-20,"Leveraging Partnerships, Technology, and Design To Enhance Water Quality Through the Inaugural Aquality App",ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leveraging-partnerships-technology-design-enhance-151500468.html,1684509300,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 19, 2023 / IBMIBM, Friday, May 19, 2023, Press release pictureOriginally published on the IBM BlogSummary:Together with IBM, Deltares is working to enhance and expand the reach of its Aquality app, formerly called the Nitrate app. The tool can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable.The Aquality app leverages technologies such as machine learning to help communities detect nitrate pollution and other quality characteristics in water and is experimenting with artificial intelligence to provide feedback and recommendations to farmers.IBM is accepting proposals for the third cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator - focused on water management solutions - until May 31st, 2023.Apply to the 3rd Cohort by 5/31Maintaining good water quality is crucial for the overall well-being of people and the environment. Yet, reports have said that one in four people do not have access to safe drinking water. The world is making progress on clean water and sanitation, but is still far behind its target to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: ensuring access to water and sanitation for all.Agriculture is one of the main sources of contamination in the water we use to drink, fish, participate in recreational activities and more. According to reports, 78% of global ocean and freshwater pollution with excess nutrients is caused by agriculture.Nutrients, pesticides and other harmful chemicals commonly used by farmers enter the water through various channels, including runoff from fields and irrigation systems. This results in eutrophication: the over-enrichment of water by nutrients such as nitrogen, which can create severe ecological and human health consequences. For example, too much nitrate in water will stimulate algae growth, which can then deprive the water of oxygen needed by fish and other organisms that live in the water.Farmers also want to optimize their fertilizer use for economic reasons. In an ideal situation, they would be able to track the amount of fertilizer they need in order to make the best use of their resources, helping them to save money.Story continuesFortunately, there is a solution in development, all thanks to the power of data and human-centered design.A solution to improve farming's impact on water qualityMonitoring nitrate levels is critical to managing and improving water quality.That's why Deltares, a non-profit research organization based in the Netherlands, teamed up with IBM to enhance and expand the reach of its Aquality app: to find a tech solution that helps farmers monitor nitrate levels and give insights into nutrient losses and local water quality.This app, originally created by Deltares, is free for users and can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable.Deltares joined the IBM Sustainability Accelerator to implement a new user interface designed to make the app more accessible for farmers, add more value to the user, and increase adoption. After completing the first phase with the IBM Garage, a new version of the app will become available in the next few months with enhanced user experience, measurement recording and information sharing capabilities.This solution is being developed to support farmers with the intention of using IBM technology, such as artificial intelligence, to provide an easy and accessible platform to engage with other farmers and to share water quality knowledge with communities.""The main goal is to provide farmers - even those who aren't the most technologically savvy - with a tool that helps them to optimize their resources, which is advantageous to both the farmer and the planet,"" said Joachim Rozemeijer, a water quality researcher at Deltares. ""IBM's technology and expertise has been instrumental in helping us achieve this mission.""Improving water quality with human-centered designAnother key component of the project is the use of IBM's Enterprise Design Thinking framework to create value for the business, people and the planet. The framework was applied to assess the app from a user perspective to bring more value to communities.""We've been doing a lot of research, talking to farmers, but also agricultural advisors, people from water authorities, and even researchers who use the app currently,"" said Michelle ten Pas, a UX Design Consultant at IBM helping with the redesign of the app. ""We translated those needs that we identified through the user research, and we implemented them by redesigning the app in a way that meets their needs.""Many enhancements have already been made to the usability, accessibility and functionality of the Aquality app. For example, to make it easier to understand how the app works, the team added instructions in the app that explain how to take measurements, which is particularly helpful for first-time users.Other new functionalities that the team hopes to add based on farmer feedback include the ability to measure nitrate in soil, adding measurements of phosphate and ammonium in water, setting location labels that can be reused by farmers, enabling users to share measurements within groups to ease collaboration and even adding a page within the app for farmers to order the equipment they need. The new version of the app is expected to go live in the coming months.The global Aquality app user community currently consists of over 600 active users and thousands of direct beneficiaries, in particular in the Netherlands. For example, measurements from the App inform environmental monitoring and management efforts in the provinces of Limburg and Zeeland. Further, the App is now being piloted by users in Denmark, France, South Africa and the United States, which provides an opportunity to continue testing the app with more farmers to increase awareness and address a greater variety of needs.Solutions for real-world impactTo help protect our environment and aid farmers around the world, utilizing sustainable agriculture systems is critical. This project is a great example of how technology and partnerships can help solve some of the most urgent environmental challenges.""What makes me proud about this project is that I can really contribute to something that matters,"" said ten Pas. ""I think you see a lot that people from my generation are looking for meaning in their work, and something where they can make an impact. And I think this project is exactly that.""But progress can't end here. IBM announced in March that it is currently accepting proposals for its third cohort focused on water management solutions, providing more opportunities to support solutions like the Aquality app. Nonprofit and governmental organizations are encouraged to apply by May 31, 2023.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/756095/Leveraging-Partnerships-Technology-and-Design-To-Enhance-Water-Quality-Through-the-Inaugural-Aquality-App]"

Buzbee is seeking documents on the plant and maintenance, according to court filings.""Marathon, due to negligence and disregard for the well-being of everything but their bottom line has devastated me and my family,"" said Alyssa Higgins, a daughter of the deceased worker.A Marathon spokesperson said the company is committed to determining the cause of the incident and has invested more than $1 billion on safety and regulatory upgrades since acquiring the facility.""Our OSHA recordable incident rate (ORIR) is better than the industry average. We remain committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety, and our goal is to eliminate injuries at our site,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""The safety of our workers and the community remain paramount.""The company said this week it launched an investigation into the blaze but has not released any findings.""Scott always thought he might die at that plant,"" Buzbee said. ""He had talked to his daughters about it and his family many times. And the reason he talked to them about it is because that plant is very dangerous,"" Buzbee said.Story continues""This wasn't an unfortunate catastrophe,"" Buzbee said.The facility has had a history of accidents under Marathon's ownership since 2013 and under its previous owner, BP Plc, records show. A worker at the same plant was killed after he was electrocuted earlier this year, and in 2005, a vapor cloud released from an overflowing processing unit exploded, killing 15 contract workers and injuring 180 others.(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Aurora Ellis and Jacqueline Wong)]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this refiner have returned -11.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has lost 7.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $5.56 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -47.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $20.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -23.1%. This estimate has changed -7.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.30 indicates a change of -38.9% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $32.34 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -40.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $134.53 billion and $127.53 billion estimates indicate -25.2% and -5.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. EPS of $6.09 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +6.1%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We spent a lot of time this week talking about retail. Let's take a look at the luxury consumer. High end retail has certainly been a standout now for some time.Higher income earners keep spending. Well, there's a headline out of the Journal today that Chanel is challenging Hermes in the bag war. Now, for the first time ever, Chanel's most popular handbag-- this is the classic flap handbag-- you're looking at the Birkin right now-- is the more expensive than an Hermes Birkin.OK, so the price of the Chanel bag up 75% in just the last three years. It costs less than $6,000, 2019. That's still very, very expensive today. It's going to set you back over 10,000 bucks. Chanel saying that the price hike is due to inflation and exchange rate shifts. Certainly outpacing inflation, Akiko, by quite a margin. And take a look at the company's results. It's privately owned, but they do release their annual results. Their profit margins went from 28% in 2019, all the way up to 35% in 2021. I would guess that they're still going to continue there to the upside, given the price of this bag.AKIKO FUJITA: Is it really about inflation? That's my question. I think part of this is about perception, right? The Birkin was the exclusive up there. Chanel wants to get to that level. And to that point, there's a number here that kind of stood out to me in the Journal article. The Birkin is only 6% more than it was prepandemic level.So why is Chanel outpacing that? There's a number of ways to work that. You could limit the number of bags. You could raise the price a little more. I mean, to me, luxury is all about perception. And Chanel is trying to reach that Birkin level.Story continuesALLIE CANAL: I just don't know if they can. I mean, the Birkin bag, that's like woven into pop culture references all over. I mean, I think this is also a story about the strength and resiliency of the luxury consumer. They are willing to pay these higher prices, despite inflation, despite these price hikes, whatever you want to call it.Now, this stat from the article stood out to me. The Chanel model was $4,000 cheaper prepandemic to the Birkin in the US. Now, today, it's only $200 less. And the pandemic was not that long ago. So the fact that they're increasing these prices that dramatically is just crazy to me. I don't know if I could ever justify spending over 10 grand for a handbag.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, I wish that this is a dilemma that I actually had, which of these bags to go for. Maybe one day, though. Pras, you're a luxury guy.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yesterday, you guys complained about the watches that I was talking about being too expensive. You guys are like, $10,000 handbags, my God. Well, I mean, I know the Birkin. Even I know the Birkin-- very, very popular. I did not know about the--SEANA SMITH: You're fancy guy-- makes sense.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, right. I didn't know about this flat bag, but I'm not surprised about the--SEANA SMITH: Flat bag.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --relentless bid up in pricing because I'm seeing that in the car world. The Rolls-Royce CEO told me, the Bentley CEO told me, they are charging more and more for their cars. People are paying for that, including customization, stuff that makes their products more unique. People want to pay more and more for that because they want to have that thing that stands out. And maybe-- I don't know about this, but maybe there's some purses out there that will make you stand out in the crowd.SEANA SMITH: I think they're just trying to be a little bit more exclusive, Chanel. And they want to rival Hermes Birkin bag. I don't know if they'll get there, though.ALLIE CANAL: I don't know. But in the meantime, the richer just keep getting richer, I guess. Moving on to my story, it's Disney, the stock falling today about 2% on the heels of a fresh Wall Street downgrade. Macquarie analyst Tim Nolan downgraded shares to neutral from outperform, citing linear network declines, direct-to-consumer hurdles, and the slowing parks business. He sees those near-term uncertainties weighing on earnings, valuation, and sentiment, adding he's concerned about Disney's ability to reach streaming profitability by 2024, which is the company's current target.And part of that reason for that view is the likely purchase of Hulu from Comcast, which currently controls 1/3 of the streamer, along with those sequential subscriber declines. And then ESPN, guys, that's just an issue lurking in the background. The Wall Street Journal reporting Disney is currently laying the groundwork for that over-the-top service, which Iger has said will happen, but analysts now are saying the process to get there is going to be incredibly bumpy.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I want to just touch on quickly. We talked about ESPN yesterday. But the theme parks is very interesting to me in the sense that I read a tweet just now by Conor Sen at Bloomberg talking about how Disney built Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Typhoon Lagoon, Animal Kingdom, and California Adventure between 1982 and 2001, and they haven't built anything since, the only big thing being the Star Wars theme park. So there's like a--SEANA SMITH: Which they're closing.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right, they're close-- so there's a capacity issue there. More people want to spend money on these types of vacations and experiential things. And there hasn't been that much built out. Las Vegas has only had one major casino built since 2010. There's actually a capacity issue when it comes to those types of vacations. And maybe Disney is there to deliver that and also maybe charge higher prices.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, you know, Allie, when you mentioned the streaming profitability, the timeline there, that's an interesting one for me to watch because so much of this is about an arms race. If you say-- if Netflix says we're going to spend more, then, of course, Disney is going to match that. That's been where it's been going. Now we're starting to see a bit of a pullback in spending in content. And yet, here we are, talking about the crowded streaming landscape. At the end of the day, you do have to compete on content, and you do have to put money up if you are trying to win out in that.So there's a bit of a balancing act, it feels like, that's happening right now that's not specific to Disney. But I'm curious, now that we are in this environment of a bit of a pullback, a bit of a slowdown, how the other streaming sites also respond because at the end of the day, when you look down the line, you still want to be in a position of strength. In order to be in that position, you've got to churn out content.SEANA SMITH: You've got to churn out content. You've got to have the subscribers that are willing to pay for whatever you charge for your service. It will be interesting when we talk about the slowing economy right now, whether or not people are going to cut down on the number of subscriptions that they have and who, of course, will then take the brunt of that. When it comes to the parks business, and Pras, you brought that up here, it's amazing to me in this type of economy that people are spending, and they're spending as much as it costs to go and spend a weekend--ALLIE CANAL: They're buying Birkin bags and then going to Disney.SEANA SMITH: And Birkin bags and they're going to Disney. I mean, that's what it sounds like. It will set you back hundreds and hundreds of dollars per person.AKIKO FUJITA: That is ultra ultimate luxury. If you're taking a Birkin bag to go to Disneyland, you're doing just fine. And that is a divide we're talking about. But I don't know. Maybe there are people that are doing that.SEANA SMITH: Oh, there's Star Wars hotel. What, was it 4,800 bucks for a weekend for a couple? That's pretty high end luxury to me.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah.AKIKO FUJITA: That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. We'll end it there. Let's talk about this other thing that I'm watching right now-- Instagram set to launch a text-based app that will compete directly with Twitter. And the app could be released as early as this summer.Now, according to details that were first released on the Substack newsletter ICYMI, In Case You Missed It, the platform will allow users to post text updates of up to 500 characters. Users will be able to attach videos of up to five minutes long, and the app is going to be decentralized here. This is going to be compatible with other apps like Mastodon. Bloomberg reports Meta's already testing the product with influencers and some creators.And we go back to where things were at the very beginning when Elon Musk bought Twitter. How many of those users moved away? I'm curious how many of those users, now Meta, Instagram, can bring on board because there are a lot of creators out there that are looking for a newer platform, where they feel like it's a little safer, they feel like there's more of a discourse. I don't know. Something you guys would try out?SEANA SMITH: Well, I think the fact the safety features that they laid out, just in terms of you can regulate who is able to reply to you, you're able to control some of your followers, features that are not available right now on Twitter, that's what I think could potentially set this service apart from what we have today on Twitter.But when we take a look at Twitter's user base, they've been struggling now for some time to continue to grow that user base. This could make sense, but you've got to question what the future looks like for a service like this, for a platform, and how many people are actually going to leave Twitter and go there. I don't know. It makes sense from a creator's perspective, though, I think.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, and they haven't figured out how to monetize it yet. That's the big question on this new platform.ALLIE CANAL: Exactly, and to me, the Twitter brand is just so strong. And we've seen other competitors try and come to market. They haven't been able to gain the same traction. You could also argue, though, that now is a good time to debut something, considering a lot of users are frustrated with all these changes under the leadership of Elon Musk. That's about to change soon.But one thing that stuck out to me was the character limit. I think 500 characters might be the sweet spot. Twitter's original character limit was 140. They doubled that in 2017 to 280. So that's something new, but yeah, to your point, I just don't know how they're going to be able to lure these users onto the platform. I guess it starts with the influencers. If you can get Gen Z, you can have access to a lot more people, but we'll see. I'm not fully convinced at this point. And do we need another social media service? Personally, I don't think so.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, I mean, what's the motto? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. And that's Zuckerberg's motto, right? I mean, he copies everything. He makes it maybe better. I don't know. When I saw the actual screenshots for the Instagram version of Twitter, it looked just like Twitter. I mean, it was almost exactly the same.And I have to ask myself, I like Instagram because I like the picture oriented, image oriented nature of it. I don't want to be writing big 500-word essays and stuff like that. I think I want to use it mostly for image. But I could be wrong. Maybe like these more influencer people will come on there and maybe want to do more interaction that way. Maybe Elon will turn off more people who will want to use Instagram for that tweeting nature.Anyway, for my take here, my roundtable pick, big news out of GM, the automaker announcing its Silverado EV work truck that's meant for Fleet customers will now top out at 450 miles of range. That's an improvement over the 400 mile prior estimate. Great for Fleet operators who want to value range over niceties like touch screens and air suspension. But the range topper will set those back around $80,000. So it's not cheap there.But GM does say the cheapest Silverado EV work truck will come in around 41,000, so. But we won't know what the range is. So there is a cheap option there, probably about half to a bit more than half of range there. But it is interesting to see That This truck will have 100 miles more range than its nearest competitor, which is the F-150 Lightning or the Rivian with the large battery pack. So kind of a big deal here in that EV pickup space.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, range anxiety is a real thing, right? I mean, and especially, Pras, I'd be curious to get your thoughts here because anything over 300, I feel like is kind of the comfort zone for those who haven't necessarily gone all in on EVs. When you talk about trucks, you've got to go even more than that because you figure those who are currently driving ICE trucks are harder to convert over to the EV side.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, I mean, if you can-- 300 miles is usually considered like the psychological barrier of what people are willing to live with. 400 miles, 450 miles, I mean, people don't want to drive that much in a single day, let alone a single trip, right? So what we're seeing is that could be the range that could help people out.But also, in the future, you could see trucks at lower range, but the ability to fill up much faster, like, in gas station time. So that could be the future, too. So we're going to see how that works out right now, but GM is sort of throwing down the gauntlet here with that 450 plus mile range.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. I think a lot of the talk here ahead of this news was that Chevy was late to this when it comes to the Silverado, given the fact that the F-150 Lightning has been out now for quite some time. But it might have been worth the wait, given the fact that a lot of people, like you guys are saying, range anxiety is such a huge thing. And the fact that you could get 450 miles here before you have to recharge is certainly a differentiating factor.I am curious, though, what the growth trajectory looks like when it comes to EV pickup trucks because I'm with you, Akiko. I would think the pickup driver would be one of the last to convert to EVs, but maybe I'm wrong.ALLIE CANAL: I agree with that. I mean, to me, it's-- I'm not a car person, but I understand the importance of mileage and of these fleets, especially when you're talking about commercial industries. So I guess we'll have to see. But it's certainly a hotly competitive market. So this doesn't surprise me.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And Ford's having a tough time keeping up with their reservations, so maybe they'll prove us all wrong.]"
233,8e037b95-73bc-4dc8-9925-d8dc7375b631,GM,2023-05-20,Toyota overhauls best-selling Tacoma pickup as competition ramps up,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toyota-overhauls-best-selling-tacoma-pickup-as-competition-ramps-up-185759582.html,1684522679,STORY,"['TM', 'TOYOF', 'GM', 'F', 'STLA']","[The legendary ‘Taco’ is getting a makeover.The Toyota Tacoma, the mid-size pickup king here in the US, is getting a total redesign and will be all new for the 2024 model year. The current generation Tacoma, which has been out since 2015 and is very similar to its predecessor that debuted in 2003, is nearly 20 years old. That's an astoundingly long period in an automotive world where cars and trucks generally have 7-year lifecycles.That said, it's going into the redesign on a high note.Toyota (TM) sold 237,323 Tacoma pickups in the US in 2022. Though down slightly from 2021, it is by far and away the top-selling mid-size pickup in the US. By comparison, GM sold a total of 117,016 Colorado/Canyon midsize pickups last year, and Ford only sold 57,005 Ranger mid-size pickups.However, both GM and Ford have redesigned their mid-size offerings for the 2023 and 2024 model years respectively to challenge the Tacoma's reign. Stellantis' Ram brand execs, per the rumor mill, also have plans to revive the Dakota mid-size pick-up.Meanwhile, in the EV pickup space, Ford and Rivian, and soon GM and Tesla, will duke it out. Ford and GM both intend to offer mid-size EV offerings as well. (There's no timeline yet.)Supremacy — gas-powered or electric — in the light-duty truck segment (which includes both mid-size and full-size pickups) is hugely important. It accounted for a whopping 79.2% of all vehicles sold in the US last year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA).In fact NADA says light-duty truck sales were up 1.6% last year, while the overall market was down 8.2%.Better than ever? The 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter edition (Toyota)To give it a leg up on the competition, in addition to all-new sheet metal, the Tacoma will be underpinned by Toyota’s new TNGA-F global truck platform, which Toyota says uses new high-strength steel. It features a redesigned suspension setup for improved ride and handling that's shared with the new full-size Tundra and Sequoia SUV,Story continues“We looked at our truck DNA and the Toyota Baja race trucks for inspiration to capture the extreme spirit of off-road adventure,” said Kevin Hunter, head of Toyota’s design research center in California. “High lift, big tires, slim body, and a powerful athletic stance define the iconic Tacoma look, referred to as ‘Tacoma-ness’.”Welcome changes: The 2024 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro interior (Toyota)While those are welcome changes, the most important update may be the powertrain options. Gone is the old V6 that Toyota hung on to far too long. In its place are two different turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. The 2.4L turbocharged 4-cylinder starts with 228 horsepower and 243 lb.-ft. of torque, but can be upgraded to a 278 horsepower and 317 lb.-ft. of torque in higher trims.And for the enthusiasts who are into manual transmissions (a trend Toyota has been capitalizing on recently), Toyota is offering a 6-speed manual that has automatic rev-matching. The non-manual engines are paired with a new 8-speed automatic transmission.Another look at the 2024 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro (Toyota)An even more powerful motor with mild hybrid power is available on the higher trim TRD versions, and special TRD Pro and Trailhunter models. Toyota’s i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain pair the 2.4L turbo four with a 48-hp electric motor and 1.87 kWh battery pack to produce a prodigious 326 horsepower— and 465 lb.-ft. of torque. Toyota says this powertrain is double the torque of the outgoing engine. (Note: this mild hybrid setup is meant for performance, and the truck does not have an all-electric drive mode.)Custom shocks and all that: The 2024 Toyota Tacoma Trailhunter edition (Toyota)In addition to that hard-core TRD Pro edition, Toyota teamed up with off-road tuner ARB to create the Trailhunter special edition, which features a 2-inch lift, custom shocks, steel bumpers, recovery hooks, and 33-inch tires for a package meant for buyers looking for an “overlander” direct from the factory. The Trailhunter also features a snorkel air intake and steel skid plates, among other features.Toyota says the all-new 2024 Tacoma will go on sale later this year, with i-FORCE MAX models coming early next year. Pricing will be announced later this year, although the current ‘Taco’ starts at $28,250, with the TRD Pro going for $47,685.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""We previously announced that it was going to be a 400-mile target, so the team did just an exceptional job in terms of being able to extend that up to 450 miles.""""A competitive advantage"": Chevy's new Silverado EV Work Truck. (General Motors)The work truck series is meant for GM's commercial fleet customers and will not be sold to regular consumers initially. The Silverado EV WT will arrive this spring with the 450-mile version costing $79,800, including shipping.Another Silverado WT model with an estimated 350-mile range will follow at a price of $74,800, with a base version WT starting as low as $41,595 with delivery. The first consumer version of the Silverado EV, the high-trim RST First Edition, arrives in the fall with a starting price of $106,695 including delivery.GM's update of the Silverado EV comes after Tesla just this week held its annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Elon Musk said the company would start rolling out “production Cybertrucks” later this year. Tesla, which announced the Cybertruck back in 2019 and said at the time that a $39,900 base version would be coming, along with a top of the line tri-motor version for $69,900, has walked back those initial pricing specs. Musk said inflation and ""other issues"" will affect the truck's MSRP.As for the Silverado WT models, pricing is generally lower compared due to a lack of niceties featured in consumer models like larger touchscreens, air suspension, supercruise, and higher towing capability. GM believes it is still a winning recipe for range-focused commercial operators.Story continues""When you look at that range, particularly in respect to the work truck which is predominantly a fleet vehicle, we believe that gives us a competitive advantage in terms of those fleet customers,"" Harvey said.This is an important time for GM with three big EV releases slated for this year — the Silverado EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, and Equinox EV, which GM says will start around $30,000. GM is planning to target cumulative EV production of 400,000 vehicles by mid-2024, with a goal of growing capacity to 1 million EVs annually by 2025.GM is standing by its forecast. That's despite a report from Reuters and research firm AutoForecast Solutions, which predict the staggered ramp-up of GM's three North American battery plants will result in the automaker reaching only 60% of that goal.""We have not changed our targets,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said to Reuters.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joins us now with the details. So what do we know?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Some upgraded figures for the new Silverado EV work truck. This is the fleet model that they're going to sell to commercial customers. They're upgrading the-- on the top end, the range to 450 miles, which is about 100 miles more than the nearest competitor, which would be the Rivian or the F-150 Lightning with the extended battery packs. That's a big deal there for these fleet commercial operators. GM says that there's going to be another 350 mile range car coming out-- truck coming out as well, and then also a entry level work truck that they haven't said the range yet. But pricing-wise, you know, that entry level one starts around 42,000, and then 75,000 for the mid-level, and 79,500 for the higher end 450 mile range.That's a big deal for GM for that in terms of a work truck. And these commercial operators want more range as opposed to niceties, like a touch screen, air suspension, things like that. So this is kind of a big deal. And I think GM for their part is saying this is the better value proposition for our fleet customers.BRAD SMITH: Touch screens are still nice to have, but maybe in the future.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, these have a little touch screen, not a 17-inch.BRAD SMITH: Exactly. Not a full dash touch screen.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.BRAD SMITH: And a new report is saying GM's EV production goal may take a hit from battery plants setbacks. So what can you tell us there?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So, you know, we had the good news with the Silverado, but then also a little bit of skepticism here from Reuters. They're working with a company called Auto Forecast Solutions, which is a big data firm that watches what happens at the factory level. And they claim that-- you know, so GM says they want to make about a million EV run rate by 2025. AFS and Reuters says it might be around 600,000 because of the ramp up of their three battery factories, they're in a staggered sort of order. And they don't think it's possible to have enough materials or enough supply to make a million.Story continuesSo they are-- with that report, GM says we're standing by our targets. We're going to hit that million EV run rate by 2025. So something to watch here as we see these battery plants come online and see how much sort of yield or rate they're going to get out of them.JULIE HYMAN: Just quickly, is lithium the choke point for all this stuff? I mean, we know that's been a challenge for all of the EV makers. Or is there other stuff in building the batteries that is also going to be challenging for them to ramp?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think materials are always a problem. In this specific report, they talked about how they just don't have the actual batteries-- oh, sorry, the plants up yet in order to make everything. They question whether they can actually make a million batteries by that 2025 deadline. So-- but it always is-- there's always materials issue. Did you secure enough forward contracts to get your lithium, and to get your nickel, and to get your cobalt, and all those sorts of things? So that's always a thing to watch.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: Great reporting. Great context. Yahoo Finance's own, Pras Subramanian. Thanks so much.]"

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for United basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For United, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for UnitedFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this airline is expected to earn $9.09 per share, which is a change of 260.7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for United. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of United to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.Sun Country Airlines (SNCY) is a stock many investors are watching right now. SNCY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.01, which compares to its industry's average of 9.11. Over the past 52 weeks, SNCY's Forward P/E has been as high as 40.49 and as low as 8.79, with a median of 11.69.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is SNCY's P/B ratio of 1.97. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 3.61. Over the past 12 months, SNCY's P/B has been as high as 2.97 and as low as 1.56, with a median of 2.17.Investors could also keep in mind United Airlines (UAL), an Transportation - Airline stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.United Airlines is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 5.01 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.10. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 9.11 and average PEG ratio of 0.30.Story continuesUAL's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 22.76 and as low as 4.51, with a median of 7.47, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.11 and as low as 0.10, with a median of 0.11, all within the past year.Additionally, United Airlines has a P/B ratio of 2.35 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 3.61. For UAL, this valuation metric has been as high as 4.36, as low as 1.76, with a median of 2.73 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Sun Country Airlines and United Airlines strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors Co. GM, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, Unum Group's UNM, MGM Resorts International MGM and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Value Stocks to Buy Amid Recession ThreatsWe are in the middle of a volatile May after a solid April. Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metrics raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained range-bound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.General Motors Co. has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM's strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.The forward P/E of General Motors for the current financial year is 4.61X, lower than the industry average of 9.84X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.47, lower than the industry average of 1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last seven days. United Airlines Holdings Inc. is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year.

One of the big takeaways from this week, companies calling out the cautious consumer.MICHAEL FIDDELKE: Consumer spending patterns continue to evolve, putting significant pressure on our discretionary categories.DOUG MCMILLON: The stubborn inflation in dry grocery consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically general merchandise.MICHAEL HARTSHORN: The low-end customer continues to be pressured, whether it's the ongoing inflation, reduction in SNAP benefits, lower tax refunds.TED DECKER: The newer dynamic now that we're really seeing again just this past quarter is a more cautious consumer given the broader macro concerns, including credit availability.SEANA SMITH: Joining us now for more on this, we want to bring in Jerry Storch, Storch Advisors CEO, also former CEO of Toys R Us. We also have Aneesha Sherman, Bernstein senior analyst here to help us break down all of these reports. Jerry, first to you, just in terms of this cautious consumer message that we have gotten time and time again over the last five days, what does that signal just about some of the cracks that we're starting to see?- Well, it's not new. This is very predictable. The consumer actually started to slow last summer and it's been pretty much a straight line since then. For the last eight months now in a row, retail sales have been negative when adjusting for inflation when you look at it on a year over year basis. And that's how retailers think about, that's how the reports come out.Story continuesWhat's your comp sales? How did this year do compared to last year? And the answer is for the economy as a whole, it's been negative and getting worse for eight straight months. The consumers are increasingly stretched. And they're running out of money and they're leveraging up their credit cards.AKIKO FUJITA: And Aneesha, are we starting to see some of that bottom out or at least starting to see some of that improvement? And what do you make of the way that some of these retailers, especially the big box names that reported this week, have adjusted to that?- I think what we're seeing differently this year-- I agree that overall the sector has been pressured. But what we're seeing differently this year is last year the mainstream and premium consumer was doing great. I mean, if you look at the numbers of some of the mainstream and premium brands in the sector, they were growing double digit in North America. And they are now comping off some really tough numbers from last year and their consumer is starting to pull back.The low-income consumer has been under pressure for over a year now. And so I think what we're seeing differently than what we did a year ago is some trade down. So we've seen transactions at Walmart, at Target, at TJX, at Ross positive year over year, which suggests that there is some trade down coming into the value side of the equation as some of those mainstream consumers make different choices. And that's what some of the new data is showing that wasn't the case last year.So for value retail, I think it's a positive. I mean, they continue to see their low-income consumer being pressured. That's not changed. What they're seeing differently is some people opting into value that used to be buying more expensive items six, eight, nine months ago.SEANA SMITH: Jerry, that trade downtrend that Aneesha is talking about, is that trend here to stay? And aside from Walmart, who's best positioned for that?GERALD STORCH: Well, it's here for a while. Since 1961, both Target and Walmart were founded. In tougher times, Walmart does better. And in worse times, Target does-- I mean, I'm sorry. In good times, Target does better.These are definitely not good times. And you see that even though everyone talks about the consumer being pressured, Walmart's comp sales were 7.6% or something, very high comp sales. Target was flat. Walmart was way up on the internet. Target was negative on the internet.So Target's really just not made, sort of, to function in this kind of environment. Whereas, Walmart with the heavy emphasis on food, consumables, and value really, really is. So I think Walmart is absolutely positioned to do well here. And so all the value retailers really are as you just heard. I think that's true.I do think, though, there's a big gap between people like Target or Costco, you know who, on the one hand, Costco will do great in any environment, Target will not. Walmart and Ross, even though they're all value stores, you see Walmart with the food being able to do well. Consumable purchases like apparel are not going to do as well.So there's companies like Five Below that I think will look very strong throughout, value player, kind of, NeeDoh type of merchandise. So there'll be winners and losers. Not all boats rise. And just because you have value attached to your name doesn't mean you'll win either.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Aneesha, an interesting comment here from Jerry because he talks about the gap that we're seeing within the value names. But we've really seen a huge gap between value everyday purchases and then the luxury consumer, which has been largely resilient.We were talking about luxury watches yesterday still doing really well. How sustainable is that? And are we starting to see any cracks on that end?ANEESHA SHERMAN: For high luxury, no. That consumer is not subject to some of these pressures that we're talking about. Inflation, fuel costs, it's really not impacting a consumer that is buying high luxury.Now, in the mainstream side, which you're talking about slightly above mainstream premium, absolutely. They are the ones who are trading down. And even last quarter, we saw Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, all the department stores, many of the mainline brands talking about losing traffic. Because those consumers are the ones who are pulling back and they are now opting into value retail.So putting food aside, I mean, obviously, food spend is different and it's more inelastic. Discretionary spend, yes, the mainstream consumer is pulling back and making different choices than they were making a year ago. And that is benefiting some of the lower-end retailers, but it's not the high luxury consumer. That is still going strong and is unimpacted by some of these macro headwinds.SEANA SMITH: Aneesha, what about inventory levels? There has been such a focus on that leading up to this quarter. We saw some improvement from Target.Home Depot was flat. Walmart's also declined. Have retailers fix this problem? And how big of a boost do you potentially see that to margins?ANEESHA SHERMAN: We are way past the peak. Retailers have made a lot of progress. And we heard it even from them in Q4. We've heard it in our channel checks. They've offloaded a lot of inventory.Now where has it gone? It's gone to liquidators, jobbers. A lot of it was sold into off price where they're holding it and pack away to sell through to the consumer later. So it's not out of the system yet, but many of them, the leading brands and retailers, have cleared it off their balance sheets.We're past the peak, they're still clearing. But we're past the peak of it and they're ordering much lower. So the net effect is going to be declining over the course of this year.That said, it's still in the system. So it's not coming out of the system, I think, at least until another three or four quarters depending on how strong demand is. Because that's the other side of it, they can't sell it through if there isn't demand. So if demand continues at the trend it's at, now I think Q1 '24 is the first we'll see where the system is clean. If demand continues to decelerate, it could even be further along.AKIKO FUJITA: Jerry, when you put together economic data that we've gotten so far on the consumer, you mesh that with what we heard from executives on these earnings calls this week. Who do you think is best positioned right now? Who's operating from a place of strength when you look at the retail landscape?GERALD STORCH: Well, I think we've been through it. There's not much doubt that Walmart is in a very strong place. And keep in mind, it's not just that they know how to operate in these times, it's that they really are heavily focused on food and consumables. And that people have to buy and do and they trade into Walmart in tough times.And Walmart is the nation's largest grocer and they're gaining share. And so they are exceptionally well positioned. I think Amazon is another company that it's very complex to analyze because of the cloud business, and the retail business, and all the pieces that are flying around there. But you notice the internet is back growing again faster than bricks and mortar. And Amazon, in many ways, still is the internet.We saw a great performance in the internet by Walmart, a very poor performance by Target. And so meanwhile, you know, I'm not embarrassed to admit I order something from Amazon almost every day of the week. And I think most of us do really look at it. So I think they're in a very strong place as well. And so many of the trends that we saw pre-pandemic are reasserting themselves with a heavy value focus at this time.AKIKO FUJITA: You are certainly not alone in your Amazon orders there, Jerry. Jerry Storch and Aneesha Sherman, good to talk to both of you today. Have a good weekend.]"
249,a76dad51-136e-3190-92a4-fc05ad14745a,TGT,2023-05-20,Container shipping under pressure as peak season hopes dim,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/container-shipping-under-pressure-peak-195250244.html,1684525970,STORY,"['TGT', 'HD']","[Peak season volumes hinge on whether inventory-destocking upside offsets consumer weakness. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)One of the earlier scenarios for container shipping’s 2023 peak season went like this: Importers would get cocky and keep much of their business in the spot market. Shipping lines would heavily curtail trans-Pacific transport capacity. America’s inventory overhang would evaporate just as holiday imports ramped up. Spot rates would jump — just as they did in 2020’s peak season after COVID lockdowns — and importers without sufficient contract coverage would get caught out.No one’s really talking about that one anymore.Inventory destocking has gone on longer than expected. Pressures on consumer demand are building. Trans-Pacific shipping capacity is not down as much as predicted. Spot rates bumped up in mid-April but have eased since and remain extremely weak.The talk now is more about a moderate peak season at best, roughly in line with pre-COVID levels, with no fireworks.Spot rates still extremely weakContainer lines implemented a general rate increase (GRI) in mid-April that was at least partially successful, finally clawing rates off the floor. However, they reportedly delayed planned GRIs in early May and mid-May, and are now looking at GRIs in June.Spot rate indexes show mid-April gains have partially stuck but rates have edged backward more recently. “Rate gains seen in April have been slipping gradually,” said Jefferies shipping analyst Omar Nokta in a research note Friday.The Freightos Baltic Daily Index (FBX) for the China-West Coast lane was at $1,497 per forty-foot equivalent unit on Thursday. That’s up 48% from before the mid-April GRI but down 14% from April 25.Drewry’s World Container Index (WCI) assessment for Shanghai-Los Angeles was at $1,823 per FEU for the week ending Thursday, up 9% from the week of April 13 but down 2% from the week of April 20.The FBX China-East Coast index was at $2,302 per FEU on Thursday, up 10% from mid-April but down 10% from April 24. The WCI Shanghai-New York rate was at $2,825 per FEU, up 11% from the week of April 13 but down 1% from the week of April 20.Story continuesSpot rates in USD per FEU. Blue line: FBX China-West Coast. Orange line: WCI Shanghai-Los Angeles. Green line: FBX China-East Coast. Purple line: WCI Shanghai-New York. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR)On the contract-rate front, pricing of new trans-Pacific annual agreements coming into force this month is sharply lower than for contracts signed the prior year.Xeneta reported Wednesday that long-term contract rates on the Asia-West Coast route averaged $1,893 per FEU. That’s down 70% from the company’s assessment of average long-term rates on this route in late November, albeit 30% higher than Xeneta’s current average spot-rate assessment.Retailer progress on inventory overhangOcean carriers Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have predicted that trans-Pacific volumes will rise in the second half due to and end to inventory destocking, supporting higher rates.They pointed out that import volumes are below U.S. consumption as inventories are drawn. When inventories wind down, imports will align better with consumption, increasing volumes. The problem with this thesis is that consumption could go down in the second half versus the first, offsetting sequential gains from a return to inventory restocking.This issue was a central focus of analyst client notes this week following quarterly results of mega-retailers Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT).Home Depot’s Q1 2023 inventories were still up 60% in nominal terms versus Q1 2019, pre-COVID. But Deutsche Bank transport analyst Amit Mehrotra maintained that “the vast majority of this likely reflects inflation.” On the consumption side, he pointed out that Home Depot “unit demand is already back to pre-pandemic levels” when adjusted for inflation.Target’s inventories were down 16% year on year and up 30% versus Q1 2019, “implying unit inventory is about flat versus 2019 when adjusting for inflation,” said Mehrotra.Evercore ISI retail analyst Greg Melich noted that Target’s sales growth since Q1 2019 exceeded its inventory growth, “suggesting that Target’s [inventory] overbuilding woes are behind them.”Walmart President John Furner said on Thursday’s conference call: “Q1 last year would have been the peak of inventories. We worked through a backlog of something like 100,000 containers that had been delayed at ports. So, lapping those costs gets bigger as you look forward to the next quarter or so. When you get into the back half of the year, things tend to normalize.”Concerns grow on consumptionAccording to Mehrotra, “The bottom line is that based on demand today, we think inventory levels are back to normalized levels. But the risk is more broad-based demand destruction as consumers pull back. Home Depot’s results clearly showcased demand destruction in the space that the company focuses on — home improvement.”Mehrotra also noted that retail sales are still above where the pre-pandemic trend line would place them, meaning sales have further to fall as they normalize.“U.S. retail sales ex-auto and gasoline were on a very consistent trend prior to the pandemic,” he wrote Friday. Extrapolating that trend suggests April retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline sales were 15% higher than the historical trend line on a nominal basis and 5% higher on an inflation-adjusted basis, he explained.“This implies that monthly retail sales need to decline by 5% to normalize to the pre-COVID trend. Said another way, the large spread between where we are today and the trend is mostly explained by inflation, with one-third explained by a pull-forward in spending: 5% is due to pull-forward, 10% due to inflation.”According to Jon Chappell, transport analyst at Evercore ISI, “Destocking has been a massive headwind to freight demand over the last year-plus and the near completion of this punitive process provides some credibility to the bottoming thesis.”However, he warned that “the demand side and what retailers are solving for when contemplating ‘right-sized’ inventories is also a moving target, and is likely much lower — when looking at the upcoming peak season — than many would have expected at the start of the year.”“So, progress for sure on the backward-looking inventory front, but still a lot of uncertainty left to play out as retailers must consider the pace of restocking in the immediate future,” said Chappell.Bookings to the U.S. relatively flat since early March. Index: 100 = Jan. 1, 2019. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR Container Atlas)When could Christmas goods buoy imports?The holiday goods trade is yet another peak-season variable.Many of the holiday cargoes were already in the bookings pipeline at this time in 2022. This year, they’re being shipped later, which should theoretically provide some support to second-half volumes.During a press conference in October 2022, Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said: “September is traditionally a high-volume month for end-of-year products. Think toys and games, clothing, footwear and other products. Those holiday gift items dropped precipitously compared to [September 2021], mainly because they came in earlier. Our peak season was in June and July as importers moved up the arrival of these goods to bring some certainty to when they could get to market.”The early peak season in 2022 was driven by fears of delivery delays due to port congestion and potential West Coast port labor unrest. Carrier schedules are not fully back to normal yet but there are no port queues this year. And importers have already switched supply chains to the East and Gulf coast ports to avoid the labor risk. Thus, there’s no need to rush holiday-goods imports.Seroka said during a conference call Thursday that this year’s peak season will come later — and could be abbreviated.“My estimation on peak season based on purchase orders that have already gone out and discussions with retailers, manufacturers and automotive companies is that we’ll probably see a relatively short peak season between the months of September and October,” said Seroka.“That may start a little bit earlier for folks who want to ensure in-store and D.C. [distribution center] dates and it may run a little bit later into November if folks are trying to get that last-minute cargo through.”Alan McCorkle, CEO of the Los Angeles’ Yusen Terminals, said during the same press conference: “What we’re hearing from our customer base is that … we will see a little bit more of a traditional peak. As we get into later in the summer months and into the fall, we’ll start to see volume pick back up to resupply for the holiday season.”(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach)Click for more articles by Greg MillerRelated articles:Shipping boom hangover: When measuring markets gets trickyUS imports up again in April as market mirrors pre-COVID ‘normal’2nd-half freight rebound increasingly unlikelyHapag-Lloyd: Higher costs will inevitably push up shipping ratesMaersk: Downturn on predicted course, liners acting ‘rationally’Container shipping warning: Green shoots are ‘transitory illusion’As Asia-US shipping rates rise, so does skepticism on staying powerMixed signals: Container shipping downturn not following the scriptThe post Container shipping under pressure as peak season hopes dim appeared first on FreightWaves.]"
250,95a61afa-8cec-3010-b35e-203ad291cc90,TGT,2023-05-20,Dissecting Retail Earnings and Shifting Consumer Spending Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dissecting-retail-earnings-shifting-consumer-184106417.html,1684521666,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'WMT', 'TGT', 'AMZN', 'FL']","[It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and uncertainty about the economy has forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart WMT report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores and digital offerings in response to the aforementioned headwinds. The expected continuation of this same trend is also at the root of management’s upgraded guidance for the year.Another trend at play is the shift in consumer preference for ‘wants’ instead of ‘needs.’ Given the macroeconomic clouds, it makes intuitive sense that consumers will rationally shift away from discretionary spending categories without curbing their demand for essentials. Walmart is better positioned than Target TGT for such an environment, given its significantly bigger grocery business.However, we should keep in mind that consumers aren’t moving away from all discretionary categories as they continue to spend on leisure, hospitality, and travel services. Consumers spent heavily on discretionary ‘goods’ during Covid and seem to be in no hurry to replace them. But they seem to be making up for missing out on the ‘experiential’ discretionary services of the type mentioned above.Some of this is likely tied to income distributions as well, with lower-income consumers restricting their spending to their needs and pulling back on discretionary spending of all types.An excellent example of this is Friday’s Foot Locker FL bombshell, with the company not only missing estimates but significantly cutting guidance for the year. Foot Locker is heavily exposed to lower-income consumers, and that demographic’s outlook remains uncertain, particularly if the labor market starts losing ground going forward because of macroeconomic factors.Story continuesThe retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times, and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory. Otherwise, they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise, as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart WMT and Target TGT last year.Then there is outright theft, referred to as ‘shrink’ by the retailers. Target estimates that ‘shrink’ will be a $500 million hit to its earnings this year. Most management teams shy away from quantifying the full extent of this problem. But published comments from retail industry professionals suggest that the problem has never been this big.Retailers also need to ensure they have the correct type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much patio furniture last Spring that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target, and others face daily.Both Walmart and Target have done an excellent job on the inventory front, but part of the reason for the Foot Locker guidance cut is the inventory pileup. What is most intriguing concerning Foot Locker is that they failed to see any of this during their March 2023 update.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so.You can see this in the one-year performance of Walmart (blue line, up +26.2%) and Target (red line, down -0.8%) relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line, up +8%). We added Foot Locker (orange line, down -2.3%) to the mix to show the stock’s dramatic fall after the aforementioned earnings disappointment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s official industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 26 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already include the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +6.2% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 84.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart)Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 19th, we now have Q1 earnings from 473 S&amp;P 500 members, or 94.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 78% beating EPS estimates and 74.8% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 150 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. This week’s docket includes Lowe’s, Nvidia, Best Buy, Ralph Lauren, Dicks Sporting Goods, and others.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 459 index members in other recent periods.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the companies that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.8% on +4.4% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get to down earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That’s what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in-line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchActual results provide a lot better on this front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases, with the outperformance particularly notable for the Tech sector.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne notable recent development on the earnings front, which we have been flagging in recent weeks, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings are flat or unchanged as a whole and +0.4%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Decoding Recent Positive Earnings Estimate Revisions  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: CSX) has been recognized by intermodal providers as the top-performing railroad in North America. The “Intermodal Service Scorecard” ranking was compiled by the Journal of Commerce, and assessed performance through the first four months of 2023.To create the Scorecard, more than 100 shippers and intermodal marketing companies were invited to perform a satisfaction assessment. Respondents cited their satisfaction with domestic intermodal service as a key driver of CSX’s number one ranking. Customers highlighted improvements in the railroad’s fluidity, train speed and customer service.“CSX is proud to be recognized by our customers for the quality of our service delivery,” said President and CEO Joe Hinrichs. “CSX’s service performance has returned to — or in many cases surpassed — our pre-pandemic levels. However, we know that we must demonstrate to our customers that we can provide a sustained high level of service. And I assure you that we’re committed to continually partnering with our customers to deliver solutions that meet their business needs.”CSX recently reported first quarter intermodal trip plan compliance results above 95 percent, demonstrating its strong record of meeting rail car scheduling plans. The company’s improved service reliability was also cited by the Surface Transportation Board in its recent decision to release CSX from a temporary requirement for Class I railroads to submit bi-weekly service metrics reports. CSX is the only one of the Class Is to no longer be subject to the requirement.To learn more about CSX’s ranking on the Journal of Commerce Intermodal Service Scorecard, click here.About CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in CSX (CSX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CSX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?CSX's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at CSX's main business drivers.CSX Corporation is one of United States’ leading transportation companies. The company, based in Jacksonville, Fl, offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to- truck transfers.CSX, incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law, offers customers access to a large and interconnected transportation network. The company's fiscal year coincides with the calendar year.CSX Transportation is the company’s primary operating subsidiary. Through the subsidiary, the company provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its rail network, spanning across approximately 19,500 route miles. CSXT also offers service to multiple production and distribution facilities apart from managing activities like real estate sales .Through this vast network, the company offers services to major population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and Ontario and Quebec in Canada. CSX owns multiple locomotives. Freight, switching and auxiliary units are present in the locomotive fleet. CSX also leases locomotives on a short-term basis.CSX conducts its operations primarily through five business lines:Merchandise (accounted for 55% of total revenue in 2022): The merchandise business consists of one million carloads per year of aggregates, which include crushed stone, sand and gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer (manufactured goods and appliances), agricultural, paper and chemical products.Coal (16%): The segment delivers carloads of coal, coke and iron ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers and terminals, steel makers apart from industrial plants.Intermodal (16%): Through its network of approximately 30 terminals, Intermodal serves all the major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports, mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, thereby providing customers truck-like service for longer shipments.Trucking (7%): Introduced in third-quarter 2021, the segment consists of the operations of Quality Carriers, which was acquired in July 2021.Other (6%): The segment, introduced in the second quarter of 2010, includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in CSX a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $3,748.84, or a gain of 274.88%, as of May 19, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 151.76% and the price of gold increased 38.74% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for CSX.CSX expects revenue ton miles in 2023 to grow in low single digits in 2023 driven by strong anticipated performances in the merchandise and coal units. To counter inflationary pressures, the railroad operator aims to improve efficiencies. In first-quarter 2023, operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) improved to 60.5% from 62.4% a year ago due to lower costs. We are also impressed by CSX's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In February 2023, CSX upped its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share. However, supply-chain disturbances are hurting CSX's operations. Elevated capital expenditures are also worrisome. CSX's management expects current-year capex to be approximately $2.3 billion, which is higher than 2022 actuals.The stock is up 5.13% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 9 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS, Skechers U.S.A. Inc. SKX, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK and Marriott International Inc. MAR.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks Defying Market VolatilityWall Street has remained range-bound since April barring 2-3 days of rally or decline. Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market remains resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. Despite a recessionary threat, a handful of consumer discretionary stocks look promising at this stage.The consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services, which are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.On the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector has flourished so far in 2023. This sector is generally recognized as a growth-oriented sector. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of market interest rate and are inversely related.The consumer discretionary sector suffered a big blow in 2022 as the Fed pursued an aggressive interest rate hike and tighter monetary control policy in order to control the 40-year high inflation. However, the magnitude of rate hike has reduced to quite an extent in 2023 as the inflation rate has declined steadily from its peak in June 2022.Story continuesMoreover, in his May FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the interest rate hike cycle has perhaps reached its end. Consequently, a growth sector like consumer discretionary has regained its lost glory.Year to date, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) — one of the 11 broad-sector ETFs of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has rallied 16.5%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Las Vegas Sands Corp. has been benefiting from a solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets, and attractive property locations. LVS is optimistic about Macao's recovery on the back of resilient customer demand and spending.With the easing of restrictions coupled with a recovery in travel and tourism, LVS anticipates generating strong cash flows from the region in the days ahead. Also, management emphasized increasing investment in the Singapore market and boosting offerings throughout 2023.Zacks Rank #2 Las Vegas Sands has expected revenue and earnings growth rates of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 23% over the last 30 days.Skechers U.S.A. Inc. has been benefiting from its enhanced digital capabilities. Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are also driving growth for SKX.In first-quarter 2023, revenues and earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year on higher direct-to-consumer and wholesale sales. International sales increased 21.1% year over year, accounting for 63% of the overall sales in the quarter. SKX is witnessing solid demand for its comfort technology products.Zacks Rank #1 Skechers U.S.A.  has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.5% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. has been benefiting from strong close-in bookings at higher prices and continued strength of onboard spending driving load factors. Considering the extension of the WAVE season and solid pent-up demand, RCL raised its 2023 guidance. RCL expects adjusted EPS to be $4.40-$4.80, up from the previously stated $3-$3.60.Zacks Rank #2 Royal Caribbean Cruises has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 47.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year.

CNK operates 408 theatres and 4,657 screens in 38 states in the United States and internationally in 12 countries, mainly in Mexico, South and Central America.Zacks Rank #2 Cinemark has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.1% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 54.5% over the last seven days.Marriott International Inc. is benefiting from its focus on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program. MAR is gaining from reopening international borders and leniency in travel restrictions resulting in robust leisure demand along with business and cross-border travel improvements. MAR is consistently trying to expand its worldwide presence and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets.Zacks Rank #1 Marriott International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 24.5%, respectively, for the current year.

ROST reported robust first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales came in line. Both metrics grew year over year.Ross Stores’ earnings of $1.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $1.06 per share and our estimate of $1.03 per share. Earnings also improved 12.4% from 97 cents per share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Total sales of $4,494.7 million rose 3.7% year over year and matched the consensus estimate of $4,495 million. The figure came ahead of our estimate of $4,464.6 million. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, comps improved 1% driven by an increase in transactions.Strength in cosmetics and accessories aided the top line with Midwest being the top-performing region. dd’s DISCOUNTS performance remained drab due to inflationary pressures.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of ROST have lost 8.9% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7%.Q1 InsightsThe cost of goods sold (COGS) of $3,292.6 million increased 3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 73.3%, marking a year-over-year contraction of 50 basis points (bps). This was mainly driven by higher merchandise margin, lower ocean freight costs and a 60-bps decline in domestic freight which more than offset higher distribution expenses. Higher distribution expenses rose 65 bps, owing to the unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from the company’s new Houston distribution center.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses of $746.2 million advanced 11.5% year over year. SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, expanded 110 bps year over year to 16.6%. The decrease resulted from lower incentive costs.The operating margin of 10.1% contracted 70 bps from 10.8% in first-quarter fiscal 2022 due to higher incentive compensation.Store UpdateAs of Apr 29, 2023, Ross Stores operated 2,034 outlets, including 1,704 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and 330 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 22 states.In first-quarter 2023, the company opened 19 stores, comprising 11 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS stores. In fiscal 2023, it expects to open 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include the plans to close 10 existing stores in fiscal 2023.Story continuesFinancialsRoss Stores ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,416.5 million, long-term debt of $2,457.6 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,310.4 million.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company bought back 2.2 million shares of common stock for $234 million in the fiscal first quarter. ROST is on track to repurchase the remaining $950 million under the existing plan in fiscal 2023. For the fiscal second quarter, it intends to open 27 locations, including 18 Ross and nine dd’s DISCOUNTS locations.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteOutlookManagement noted that the ongoing high level of uncertainty in macroeconomic and geopolitical environments is likely to persist. Also, continued inflationary pressures continue to affect customers’ discretionary spending.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects comps to remain flat year over year. Also, the bottom line is envisioned to be $1.07-$1.14 per share, compared with last year’s reported figure of $1.11 per share. Total sales are forecasted to grow 1-4% year over year.The operating margin is estimated to be in the 9.8-10.1% range, down from 11.3% reported in 2022, driven by higher merchandise margin and lower ocean freight costs offset by increased expenses related to incentive compensation and store wages. Interest income is likely to be approximately $31 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be $339 million.For fiscal 2023, the bottom line is predicted to be $4.77-$4.99 per share, compared to the prior year’s reported figure of $4.38 per share.

But long-term investors don’t need to worry too much about market timing. Plus, there are many great stocks with proven and resilient businesses that investors should feel comfortable buying now at rather attractive levels and holding for the long haul. The two stocks we dive into today are Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and Visa Inc. (V).Debt-ceiling talks have taken over Wall Street in recent days even as Walmart, Target, and other huge names round out the first quarter earnings season. President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy finally started to talk positively about a deal mid-week to help send stocks climbing. Stocks then dipped on Friday on reports that talks are stalling again.Thankfully, a debt-ceiling deal is almost certain to get done despite all of the worrisome partisan discourse and back and forth because defaulting could be catastrophic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe market is also telling investors not to worry too much, with the S&amp;P 500 currently up 9% in 2023 and the Nasdaq about 21% higher. Both indexes also still trade well off their record highs, which leaves room for plenty of potential near-term upside if earnings outlooks hold steady in the coming months and inflation continues to cool.Better yet, there are tons of great, proven large-cap stocks trading at potentially attractive levels right now that long-term investors should feel comfortable buying and holding even if the market hits a few roadblocks later this year.Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) is a diversified global leader in medical and lab equipment, specialty diagnostics tools, reagents and consumables, and much more. TMO’s offerings serve the broader biotech, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sector, operating under units such as Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, and beyond.Story continuesThermo Fisher benefitted immensely from Covid-19 testing. But TMO’s sales and earnings were surging long before the pandemic and its near-term outlook for FY23 and FY24 showcases top and bottom line expansion even as it faces a very difficult to compete against stretch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThermo Fisher, which lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, topped our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates in late April. The $200 billion market cap titan is currently trading around 20% below its highs and its average Zacks price target. And 12 of the 16 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for TMO stock are “Strong Buys.”TMO shares are still up 55% in the last three years and 500% in the last decades vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 160% and its Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s 190%. Plus, TMO is trading around 30% below its 10-year highs at 21.1X forward earnings and at an even larger discount vs. its industry despite its big outperformance. And TMO raised its dividend by 17% earlier this year.Visa Inc. (V) is a credit card giant that remains hugely influential in the U.S. and around the world despite all of the ‘disruptions’ from fintech. Visa operates an extensive and powerful payment and processing network and it takes a piece of the endless number of credit card payments in a world that is growing more cashless by the day.Visa beat our quarterly earnings estimates in late April on the back of rising payment volume. The company is also benefitting from surging international travel alongside rival Mastercard. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa’s FY23 and FY24 consensus earnings estimates have popped slightly since its release and it lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. Zacks estimates call for Visa to post 14% adjusted earnings growth this year and 13% higher earnings next year, driven by roughly 11% sales growth both this year and next.Visa stock has unperformed the market over the last three years, up 20% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 40%. But it could be poised to break out with it back above both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. On top of that, Visa has more than doubled the benchmark over the last 10 years, up 415%. And Visa is trading slightly below its 10-year median and at a roughly 35% discount to its own highs at 25.2X forward earnings. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WEX.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2096760/5-financial-transaction-stocks-to-watch-as-digitization-gains-paceThe Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to gain on the back of the widespread uptake of digital means, leading to solid transaction volumes. A tactical merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy and tech investments enable the players to devise an advanced digital solutions suite. Resilient consumer spending, despite continued inflationary pressure, bodes well. Growing cross-border volumes resulting from a recovery in travel might boost the revenue growth of industry players. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. and WEX Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry's encouraging growth prospects.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe, facilitating the switching of transactions and permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining the Fate of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryGrowing Digitization: The pandemic led to a widespread inclination toward adopting digital means. Amid several roadblocks thrown by the pandemic, people became aware about the convenience and affordability brought about by digital payments. A diversified set of flexible payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later solutions, mobile wallets, biometrics, to QR code utilization, came to the forefront.Story continuesThe world witnessed a higher Internet penetration rate and increased usage of smartphones. Thereby, financial transaction services stocks were compelled to launch contactless payment solutions or upgrade the existing ones in order to capture a sizable share of the global digital payments market. For such growth-related initiatives, the companies frequently resort to innovative technologies, which in turn, might escalate costs. However, digital prowess is pivotal in bolstering the customer base and diversifying income streams for the industry players in the long term.A Prudent M&amp;A Strategy: Apart from tech investments, an active M&amp;A strategy is crucial to developing an efficient digital suite for financial transaction services companies. The pursuit of such a strategy also reflects their intensified focus on entering new markets, widening market share and attracting customers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by governments of different countries in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down.This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. An exciting year awaits, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC's Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Favorable Consumer Spending: Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market and substantial savings in hand keep the purchasing power of consumers steady amid looming fears of inflation and recession. The ease and affordability of e-commerce shopping continue to drive consumer spending growth and enable industry players to process a larger amount of transaction volumes through their card offerings. Per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending increased by $129.6 billion sequentially in the first quarter of 2023. Market and consumer data provider, Statista estimates consumer spending to witness 34.8% growth over the 2023-2028 period.Rebounding Cross-Border Travel: People are now likely to travel across the world, which can be either for recreational purposes or for business. With organizations preferring a return-to-office policy, business travel is likely to remain on an uptrend in the days ahead. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. In order to handle the growing pace of business travel, the industry players have come up with innovative business travel solutions for easier flight bookings.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

266,1667c318-c815-35f3-a0b7-8ad3ca2bbf50,V,2023-05-20,Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-largely-130023794.html,1684414823,STORY,['V'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Visa's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions39% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Visa. View our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Visa does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Visa's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Visa is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.0% and 3.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of VisaWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Visa Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$239m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Visa. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Visa that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund and recent developments, and go directly to read Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks. Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975. Today, it is one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds due to its distinctive approach to investing. Dalio’s investment philosophy emphasizes radical transparency, meritocracy, and the importance of understanding and managing risk. Dalio's approach combines macroeconomic analysis with fundamental research to identify investment opportunities and manage portfolio risk. Under Dalio's leadership, Bridgewater Associates has achieved remarkable success and has been recognized as one of the top-performing hedge funds in the world. The firm manages assets for a wide range of clients, including institutional investors, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of Bridgewater Associates, as Dalio gave up control of the hedge fund to a new generation of investors in 2022. However, he has kept his seat on the firm’s board. Following his decision to retire, Dalio has recently announced to set up his family office branch in Abu Dhabi, as reported by Bloomberg.  Previously, he had a business relationship with Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).As an influential investor and market commentator, Dalio often provides his perspectives on various economic topics and trends through interviews, public speeches, and his writings. The recent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failure has created a new uncertain environment across the stock market and Dalio has also shared his insights on this matter. In his interview with Business Insider, he shared that this bank fallout would have larger implications for the stock market in the coming years. Dalio has also given a skeptical outlook for the market. Here are some comments from the billionaire investor:Story continues“Markets will see more borrowing in the coming years as the federal government grapples with massive budget deficits, he said. In order to fill the deficit hole, the government must borrow money by selling debt, such as US Treasurys, but debt investors need to have a high enough real return.”As of the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of $16.3 billion, down from $18.3 billion in the last quarter. The hedge fund had widely invested in dividend stocks such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). In this article, we will further discuss the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio.Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 12 Dividend Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology:For this list, we selected top dividend-paying stocks from the latest 13F portfolio of Bridgewater, where Dalio remains a mentor, board member, and investor. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.12. Mondelez International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) is an Illinois-based multinational food company that also produces snacks and beverages. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.2 million shares in the company, worth over $155.7 million. The company represented 0.95% of the firm's 13F portfolio. It is among the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio alongside some other dividend stocks like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.385 per share for a dividend yield of 1.98%, as of May 17. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past nine years.Mizuho appreciated the Q1 upside and stronger volume of Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and raised its price target on the stock to $86 in May. The firm also maintained a Buy rating on MDLZ.At the end of December 2022, 46 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), compared with 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $1.5 billion.Here’s what Coho Partners said about Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”11. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $183,825,849 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 3.61%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare and pharmacy company that is one of the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.605 per share with a dividend yield of 3.61%, as of May 17. It has raised its dividend for the past two years in a row.In May, Wells Fargo maintained an Equal Weight rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with a $76 price target. The firm mentioned that the company's recent quarterly earnings were modestly ahead of expectations.At the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.4 million shares, with a total value of over $183.8 million. The hedge fund has been investing in the company since the third quarter of 2012. During the most recent quarter, the firm reduced its position in the company by 10%, which represented 1.12% of its 13F portfolio.Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database shows that 70 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), up from 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of $2.13 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”10. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $218,590,165 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.86%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and healthcare company. It holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, having raised its payouts for 51 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.86%, as of May 17. It is among the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio.Bridgewater Associates first initiated its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) during the fourth quarter of 2010 with shares worth over $4.8 million. In the most recent quarter, the hedge fund owned ABT stakes worth nearly $218.6 million. The company accounted for 1.33% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Appreciating the strong earnings and organic growth of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the most recent quarter, Street analysts gave positive ratings to the stock. In April, both UBS and Barclays raised their price targets on the stock to $130 and $127, respectively.At the end of December 2022, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), worth collectively $3.2 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $223,390,052 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 0.78%During the first quarter of 2023, Bridgewater Associates boosted its position in Visa by 19%, ending the quarter with stakes worth $223.4 million. The company made up 1.36% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has been rewarding shareholders with 16 years of consecutive dividend growth. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share for a dividend yield of 0.78%, as of May 17.As per Insider Monkey's database, 177 hedge funds owned stakes in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in Q4 2022, up from 165 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $26.4 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $259,065,131 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 2.01%Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Washington-based multinational chain of coffeehouses that also specializes in a wide range of other beverages. In May, Wells Fargo raised its price target on the stock to $125 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's impressive quarterly earnings.On April 3, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 12 years. The stock's dividend yield on May 17 came in at 2.01%.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio. At the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.4 million shares in the company, worth roughly $260 million. The company represented 1.58% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a popular stock among hedge funds in Q4 2022, according to Insider Monkey's database. 61 hedge funds owned stakes in the company in Q4, up from 54 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes stood at over $2.65 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $393,706,835 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.52%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) owns grocery stores and department stores across the country. In 2023, the company achieved its Dividend King status after raising its payouts for 50 consecutive years.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $427,957,112 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 0.82%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American big-box retail company.

(NYSE:MRK).As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 2022 database, 66 hedge funds owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), with a total value of $3.4 billion.Madison Funds mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 10 Stocks12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy10 Best Gold Royalty Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:MAR) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-marriott-international-inc-121754216.html,1684585074,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Marriott International's shares before the 25th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.52 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.08 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Marriott International has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current stock price of $178.43. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Marriott International paid out just 16% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Marriott International generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 18% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Marriott International's earnings per share have been growing at 18% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Marriott International has delivered 15% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Marriott International an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Marriott International has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.In light of that, while Marriott International has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Marriott International you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS, Skechers U.S.A. Inc. SKX, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK and Marriott International Inc. MAR.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks Defying Market VolatilityWall Street has remained range-bound since April barring 2-3 days of rally or decline. Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market remains resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. Despite a recessionary threat, a handful of consumer discretionary stocks look promising at this stage.The consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services, which are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.On the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector has flourished so far in 2023. This sector is generally recognized as a growth-oriented sector. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of market interest rate and are inversely related.The consumer discretionary sector suffered a big blow in 2022 as the Fed pursued an aggressive interest rate hike and tighter monetary control policy in order to control the 40-year high inflation. However, the magnitude of rate hike has reduced to quite an extent in 2023 as the inflation rate has declined steadily from its peak in June 2022.Story continuesMoreover, in his May FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the interest rate hike cycle has perhaps reached its end. Consequently, a growth sector like consumer discretionary has regained its lost glory.Year to date, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) — one of the 11 broad-sector ETFs of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has rallied 16.5%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023.

271,79674fd2-07c3-378e-93e3-d51f0169e1b2,SNA,2023-05-20,Why Snap-On (SNA) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-snap-sna-great-dividend-154503793.html,1684511103,STORY,['SNA'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusBased in Kenosha, Snap-On (SNA) is in the Consumer Discretionary sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 14.34%. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.62 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.48%. This compares to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.84% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.75%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.80%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 37%, which means it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, SNA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.74 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.47%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Major companies, including Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and Verizon, have banned or restricted the OpenAI-owned chatbot, which exploded in popularity late last year. Many have cited privacy risks for the clampdowns since ChatGPT uses data from conversations to improve its accuracy, although users can opt out via ChatGPT’s settings or a Google form.Of course, several companies use ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools like Google Bard to improve productivity and free up time spent on menial tasks like drafting emails or reviewing code. Companies like Coca-Cola and Bain &amp; Company have even inked partnerships with OpenAI.But for many employers, the security risks far outweigh the productivity benefit, as evidenced by Samsung. In early April, the company reported that employees accidentally leaked confidential internal source code and meeting recordings while using the chatbot (Samsung has since banned ChatGPT’s use for employees). Apple became the latest company to ban ChatGPT, at the time of publication, citing similar concerns over data leaks.These companies are not alone in their apprehension. Italy temporarily banned the service, stating that OpenAI isn’t compliant with Europe’s GDPR privacy law, and the E.U. is close to passing a groundbreaking law governing A.I.’s use in the bloc.While the chatbot is currently restricted in certain offices, that might not always be the case. Some companies, like JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, have indicated they’ll allow ChatGPT if it’s fully vetted for safe use. Others, like Goldman Sachs and Samsung, are developing their own A.I. tools for employee usage.Story continuesBelow are companies that have banned or restricted employees from using ChatGPT at work.AppleApple is restricting workers from using ChatGPT and other third-party A.I. tools, citing concerns about confidential data leaks. The tech giant also told employees not to use the automated software code-writing program Copilot, developed by GitHub and OpenAI (both owned or backed by Microsoft). Apple, which tapped Google veteran John Giannandrea to lead its A.I. efforts in 2018, is reportedly developing its own A.I. tools.Bank of AmericaBank of America added ChatGPT to its list of unauthorized apps that employees are prohibited from using for business, insiders told Bloomberg in February. The bank is one of many to implement stricter compliance measures around internal communications after U.S. regulators levied over $2 billion in fines for the firm's failure to monitor employee use of unauthorized messaging apps like WhatsApp.CalixCEO Michael Weening announced on LinkedIn that the Calif.-based telecommunications company banned ChatGPT across all business functions and devices in April. He cited Samsung’s recent leak as the driving reason for the ban, writing it is “disconcerting” that ChatGPT could expose sensitive information like confidential internal memos or customer contracts under NDA to outsiders. “The world is changing. Big time. People need to read the fine print (or lack of it) and educate teams.""CitigroupCitigroup added ChatGPT to its standard firm-wide controls for third-party software, where certain categories of websites are automatically restricted. “We are actively exploring a number of avenues that would give us a better understanding of the benefits and potential associated risks of using this technology,” a spokesperson tells Fortune.Deutsche BankAccess to ChatGPT has been disabled for Deutsche Bank staff since at least February. The restriction is standard practice for third-party websites, a spokesperson tells Fortune, noting its aim is to protect the bank from data leakage rather than an indication of the tool’s usefulness. In the meantime, the bank says it will evaluate how to best use the platform while protecting its own and client’s data. The bank is developing A.I. chatbots and was an early business partner of Google Cloud’s generative A.I. offerings.Goldman SachsLike Citigroup, Goldman Sachs blocked access to ChatGPT for employees through an automatic restriction on third-party software, as Bloomberg first reported in February.But Goldman is in the process of developing its own generative A.I. tools. Goldman chief information officer Marco Argenti said the bank has several “proof of concepts” to streamline tasks like document classification and categorization, summarizing earnings calls, or research for a daily digest.JPMorgan ChaseAmerica’s largest bank restricted the use of ChatGPT for employees in late February, a person familiar with the decision told Bloomberg. The decision is part of standard controls for third-party software, the person said. But the bank may be open to using the tool in the future, noting in its 2022 annual report that it’s “imagining new ways to augment and empower employees with A.I. through human-centered collaborative tools and workflow, leveraging tools like large language models, including ChatGPT.” The bank did not respond to Fortune’s request for clarification on how it’s restricted.Northrup GrummanThe aerospace and defense technology company blocked the tool earlier this year, claiming it doesn’t share company or customer information with outside tools until vetted. One employee told the Wall Street Journal he used the chatbot for months prior to the ban, asking it concept questions about code before turning the plain language response into code itself. He compared the bot to a “really cool, patient mentor who’s not going to be annoyed by you asking a lot of questions.” Northrop Grumman did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.VerizonThe telecommunications giant is also concerned about privacy and security with ChatGPT. Verizon informed employees in mid-February that the program is not accessible via corporate systems due to the risk of losing control of sensitive information like customer data and source code. “Our top priority is our four stakeholders: communities, customers, investors/shareholders, and society, and we have to be thoughtful when introducing a new and emerging technology such as a ChatGPT,” a communications manager at Verizon wrote to employees.SamsungSouth Korea-based Samsung banned employee use of ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools in early May. The restriction came after engineers accidentally leaked confidential information, including internal code and meeting recordings, in April, by uploading it to the chatbot. Employees are banned from accessing the tools on company-owned devices and its internal networks. However, Samsung creating its own A.I. tools that employees can use for software development, translation, and summarizing documents.Below are companies that have not outright banned ChatGPT but requested employees not to share confidential information on the platform:AccentureAccenture restricts its 700,000 employees from using ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools while coding, noting they must obtain permission to share company or client data. Accenture did not respond to Fortune’s request for clarification on the restrictions.AmazonAmazon warned employees against sharing confidential company information with ChatGPT, citing instances in which the chatbot’s responses looked similar to internal data, according to messages viewed by Insider.Amazon employees have reported receiving a popup warning that they are entering a third-party site that “may not be approved for use by Amazon Security'' when visiting ChatGPT’s website. Engineers looking for coding support are encouraged to use an internal A.I. tool called CodeWhisperer. But employees are not outright restricted from using ChatGPT or similar tools. “We have safeguards in place for employee use of these technologies, including guidance on accessing third-party generative A.I. services and protecting confidential information,” a spokesperson tells Fortune.PwC AustraliaThe Australian division of the professional services firm warned employees against using any material or information outputted by ChatGPT and prohibited sharing firm or client data with the tool, according to an internal newsletter. However, it still permits access to ChatGPT and encourages employees to experiment personally. Jacqui Visch, PwC Australia’s chief digital and information officer, told the Australian Financial Review the company is exploring cybersecurity and legal considerations before permitting the chatbot for any business use.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Verizon is also bringing fans closer to the action with 5G Multi-View, which allows fans at the event to customize their viewing experience in real-time. Fans can toggle between seven different camera angles of live action from the track on their phones, including the live TV broadcast.“Innovation has been at the forefront of IMS’s mission since its inception in 1909,” IMS President J. Douglas Boles said. “Verizon 5G Multi-View transforms the way fans watch the Indy 500. Once they’re connected, they’ll never miss a moment of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.”“With 5G Multi-View, powered by Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network, we’re giving fans the best seat in the house regardless of where they are in the venue,” said Joe Russo, EVP and President of Global Networks and Technology at Verizon. “We’ve also upgraded our network at the venue so fans can always capture and share their experiences quickly and reliably.”Multi-View is available in the official INDYCAR App powered by NTT DATA. Fans with a 5G device can switch between the action in the pit to see who’s in the lead coming out of turn 1. Additional cameras will provide in-car and turn 3 views, among others.Verizon Upgrades Network for Race FansLast year, Verizon customers attending the event used 17 TB of data, and Verizon engineers are expecting even greater usage this year. To prepare the area, engineers have deployed additional 4G and 5G service inside the track, throughout the Grandstands, turns 3 and 4, as well as at gates 9, 10 and 11. Engineers have used a variety of spectrum to provide these upgraded services. For 5G services, Verizon is using a combination of C-band, its mid-band spectrum designed for excellent coverage and mmWave, its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for massive capacity. Verizon recently announced upgrades to the entire Indianapolis area where 99% of customers now have access to 5G Ultra Wideband service.Verizon’s super-fast 5G Ultra Wideband provides a broadband-like connection in more than 95 stadiums and arenas, and is available to more than 200 million people across the US.Story continuesVerizon Communications Inc.

Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband brings power and performance comparable to a wired broadband internet connection to customers’ pockets.These expansions come on the heels of major 5G Ultra Wideband deployments in larger metros in Ohio including Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Dayton. The nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics® recently completed testing in Cincinnati, Toledo and Dayton and ranked Verizon’s network the best in overall network performance in each of those markets.“Expanding 5G service into the more rural areas of Ohio will enhance connectivity and will greatly benefit residents, helping them be more a part of the modern economy, healthcare and education system,” said Ohio Lt. Governor Jon Husted. “On the state level, we look forward to continuing efforts to close the digital divide through the Ohio Broadband Strategy, and we support private investments that make expanded internet a reality.”Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband enables people to do things on their mobile device that many could only do before when connected to their home internet service. This includes everything from downloading huge documents and streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats, video conferencing and FaceTime calls with clear sound and video.“Verizon is widely known for having an exceptionally reliable 5G network experience, and it’s exciting to see the positive impact our work has had in Ohio,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our network engineers work tirelessly to provide unmatched connectivity to our customers across Sylvania, Swanton, Lima, Ada, Mount Vernon, Zanesville, and Cambridge and beyond, and we will not slow down.”Story continuesNetwork enhancements in Ohio These deployments use Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon will deploy 5G Ultra Wideband using up to 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum in multiple Ohio markets, and will add even more bandwidth once all of its licensed spectrum is made available. This additional bandwidth, which will be available at the end of this year, will provide exceptional speed and capacity.Lastly, the addition of 5G service in Ohio will result in exponential increases in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community, which requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Get the most of our 5G Ultra WidebandFor customers in Ohio, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband brings power and performance comparable to a wired broadband internet connection to customers’ pockets.Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband enables people to do things on their mobile device that many could only do before when connected to their home internet service. This includes everything from downloading huge documents and streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats, video conferencing and FaceTime calls with clear sound and video.“Verizon’s expansion into new markets across Arizona will connect more residents and visitors with this advanced technology across our great state,"" Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry President and CEO Danny Seiden said. “The availability of this platform for innovation will continue to advance technological and economic growth in our communities.”“Verizon is widely known for having an extremely reliable 5G network experience, and we are working aggressively to bring this positive impact to more areas in Arizona,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our network provides unmatched reliable connectivity to our customers across the state, and we will not slow down.”Network enhancements in Arizona These deployments use Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon will deploy 5G Ultra Wideband using 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum in multiple Arizona markets, and will add even more bandwidth once all of its licensed spectrum is made available. This additional bandwidth, which will be available at the end of this year, will provide exceptional speed and capacity.Story continuesLastly, the addition of 5G service in Arizona will result in exponential increases in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community, which requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Get the most of our 5G Ultra WidebandFor customers in Arizona, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

Launched in 2021, Tapestry and WWF are partnering to accelerate the development of deforestation- and conversion-free leather supply chains.In Central Brazil's vast Cerrado savanna, a grand experiment is taking place. Baru trees by the hundreds are being planted - some in the form of seeds, some as seedlings, and some well on their way to maturity in agroforests alongside other native vegetation. In some tracts, cattle graze among the more mature baru trees, in other areas, no cows are allowed.The point of all this testing is to uncover the premium growing conditions under which the baru (Dipteryx alata) can thrive. The species, native to the Brazilian Cerrado, is a key part of reforestation efforts in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. And overseeing a reforestation project on the Boa Vida farm near town of Bonito is a woman who is a ""traditional seed guardian,"" Elida Cristina Martins.""I found that if we planted baru with bananas nearby it grows much faster than when planted alone, and the bananas help break the wind and keep the ground wet to keep the baru healthy,"" she said as she gave a recent tour of her farm to a group of visitors from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Tapestry Foundation.The Tapestry Foundation is entering the second year of a four-year, $3 million grant to WWF to establish a deforestation-free leather supply chain and to work on reforestation efforts on the Cerrado, a vast tropical biome that includes the Pantanal headwaters, and which provides much of the water, produce and beef within Brazil and for export. One of the planet's richest savannas and one of 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world, the Cerrado is being steadily deforested as individual landowners and companies clear natural habitat to graze cattle and grow soy.Story continuesSome of the Tapestry Foundation funding goes to WWF-Brazil to fund unique reforestation programs like the one on Boa Vida. Although national legislation requires that landowners must preserve 20 percent to 35 percent of their land and all riparian vegetation as well, the rest of the land can be legally cleared due to the lack of a zero-deforestation law for the Cerrado. Because half of the Cerrado has already been converted to pasture and farmland, it's been under heavy use, and two-thirds of the pastures in the Pantanal headwaters are under moderate to severe degradation. Landscape restoration and pasture rehabilitation are key parts of solving the environmental crisis in Brazil and are therefore among the highest priorities of WWF and the Tapestry Foundation.""The purpose of our work in Brazil is to try to be part of the solution towards a more sustainable leather supply chain- one that works for the environment and local communities. During our time in Brazil, it was important that we met with local people and communities to better understand the impact climate change is having on the most vulnerable populations,"" said Julia Furnari, Director of the Tapestry Foundation. ""For vulnerable communities like this one, where so many depend on nature to survive, protecting the community and the environment helps to turn sustainable practices into long-term solutions while creating opportunity for so many.""Roughly 36 families live on the Santa Lucia settlement, of which Boa Vida is a part, and Elida Cristina Martins has been farming and raising cattle for more than 25 years on 12 hectares, or nearly 30 acres. Nearly one-third of the land in the settlement is owned by women, she said, creating a unique economic opportunity for a group that often gets overlooked in discussions about the wealth of the land and environment in South America.""We have an integrated system, where baru is planted with Crotalaria and sorghum to determine which grows better together,"" she said. The sorghum can be used for cattle feed, and therefore can be revenue-producing.In the last year alone, she has planted 2,200 trees. ""We're always testing what will work better. We experiment with multiple people planting and with a single person - me - planting, to see which grows better,"" she said. ""And we plant mango, cashew, coconut, guava, lime, pineapples --- all alongside the baru to protect it and help it thrive. Every species has a time to fruit and so you also have fruit all year long.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/755883/The-Tapestry-Foundation-Heads-to-Brazil-for-an-In-Person-Look-at-Agroforestry]"

It’s worth noting that this estimate has been revised downwards by a marginal 0.2%.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s Data Center segment includes its AI operations; for the upcoming release, we expect Data Center revenue to reach $3.9 billion, reflecting a solid increase from the year-ago quarter. As shown below, NVDA has failed to exceed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment in three consecutive quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOf course, many will also closely monitor the company’s Gaming results as the PC market has rapidly cooled. We expect NVIDIA’s Gaming segment to post revenue of $1.9 billion for the quarter, down a steep 46% from the year-ago quarter.Bottom LineWith earnings season winding down, market participants pivot their focus to NVIDIA, one of the last noteworthy tech companies yet to report.A peer, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, posted a double-beat but was negatively impacted by a slowing PC market.Analysts have been slightly bullish for NVDA’s release, with the quarterly EPS estimate being revised marginally higher over the recent term.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.51 billion, down 21.5% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.52 per share and revenue of $29.77 billion.

292,7d56adb8-935c-3d3f-a0b4-eb61cdfd7457,NVDA,2023-05-20,Stock winners and losers amid market volatility,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stock-winners-losers-amid-market-203018558.html,1684528218,VIDEO,"['MSFT', 'KRE', 'NVDA', 'BUD', 'BUDFF']","[Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joins the Live Show to discuss two stocks to own, which stocks to avoid, and gives investing tips amid an uncertain market.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Markets have been on a roller coaster this week with retail earnings, Fed talk, debt limit negotiations. Those have been the big drivers of action. Let's talk about how to play this. Ken Mahoney is back here with us, Mahoney Asset Management CEO. Ken, so let's start with your two buys. We know certainly tech has been the outperformer since the start of the year. You've got two picks in this space. First up, Nvidia. I thought this is a bit surprising, given the runup that we've seen, over 100% since January 1st. What's going to keep this momentum to the upside?KEN MAHONEY: Yeah, look, the earnings come out next Wednesday the 24th. Again, I don't have a peek at them, but I think the market is getting behind on their earnings. I mean, this reminds me of that kind of hockey stick growth that we saw with Tesla a few years ago, that valuations matter, but they don't if they're going to grow their top line. AI is a big thing. This is going to dominate. Before, I said, hey, Fed funds and all that's probably the ninth inning. Well, for AI, we're probably more in the second inning, just the beginning of the cycle.Hey, it will have its ups and downs. Recognize the stock is going parabolic. The tactics that we use as kind of buy and hold, maybe 1/2 to 2/3. And maybe trade around and sell some [INAUDIBLE]. At the end of the day, this is where the leadership's going to be, and I still believe there's a lot more upside with Nvidia throughout the rest of the year, even though the stock's already doubled this year.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I can't think about how many times have we heard AI in earnings calls, but when you think about those who have been leading, obviously, Nvidia with the chips. Microsoft certainly been a big leader on that front. It's interesting. We heard from Meta this week talking about having to own the entire stack to be able to scale AI and win in this space. How does Microsoft present an opportunity for you in terms of that and the competition that is just gearing up right now?Story continuesKEN MAHONEY: Look, Microsoft thankfully is not a one trick pony, right? So it has everything from gaming, all the different verticals, from cloud to all the different software. But you can't go without software with Microsoft. And then in addition to that will be AI. And if you look at Microsoft the last few quarters, they beat earnings and they raised guidance, same thing for Nvidia. So these are companies you always want to look for, those companies that can beat on estimates, raise guidance. And I think Microsoft's going to take a little chunk out of the dominant space for Google Search. Even a small market share goes in the right direction, and you get all those many verticals with Microsoft.SEANA SMITH: Ken, more broadly speaking, though, when you take a look at the runup in the tech sector, there was a Bank of America fund manager survey out earlier this week talking about how being long tech is one of the most crowded trades right now. Why aren't you worried about those valuations?KEN MAHONEY: Right, so everybody complains about being narrow leadership. And it is. I mean, that's just the hand that we dealt with this year. I mean, this is the kind of a bull market and a bear market. Pretty much, the Dow is unchanged for the year, and that's up 20%. You can go and hide in PEs of 6 perc-- or PEs of 8, it seems, and they'll still be trading there. Yes, you're paying a higher multiple, but you're getting a higher growth rate.And to me, again, if it's going be narrow leadership, be with the narrow leadership. If it's not going to spread out, it's not going to have strong breadth the way it's been shown, stick with the leaders. I mean, that's how we've been trained. Look at the best industry, the best stocks in those industry. Yes, they'll be volatile, but you're going to be more than compensated for that volatility.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about the other two stocks that you've pointed out to avoid. And I want to talk about KRE. This is an ETF for the regional banking sector because, yes, we have seen just the volatility there. It feels like there's starting to be a bit of a differentiation between the regional banks. Is it your sense here that the bottom-- we've hit the bottom, or do you think there's still more cracks to come when you're looking at some of the other names in the space?KEN MAHONEY: I think there are more cracks to come. The reason I picked out KRE and that's selective, let's say, banks, is, if you wake up one morning, like Pat West or some others, and they're down 10%, you go to KRE. Next thing, they're down 6%. They go down in sympathy. So I just think there's better other opportunities. As I mentioned, AI is all the rage for all the reasons. There's other pockets of strength-- semiconductors, of course. So to be in this space, regionals, you're going to have a strong start. And it's really hard to pick through what's going to make out the other side, which ones are in trouble.And every time there's a problem with just one of them, it comes back and hurts the region. I think you said earlier, for the week, we had a good week, but you saw it closed at the low of the day. And I think, still, there could be a couple of ones out there. And they always take it out of this ETF, it seems.SEANA SMITH: Ken, another pick that you suggest that people avoid is Anheuser-Busch. We know that a lot of people have been closely watching the sales of Bud Light, given the controversy and what has happened over the last several weeks. Do you think there's more downside risk ahead, it sounds like?KEN MAHONEY: Yeah, it can bounce a little bit. I mean, it's gone down so hard. I mean, it was in the high 60s before the controversy started. Below 60, I think it landed sub-60. It could bounce a little bit. It could be a short there. The sales numbers are pretty amazing, 27% week over week. You know, I didn't know it was going to be so sticky, but it is very sticky. And then looking at it, it looks very tempting. Say, hey, the stock was 70, and because of controversy, that will blow over. I'm not so sure it's going to blow over that quickly. It still remains sticky. And therefore, we would avoid that stock, as tempting as it may look, being down so much in the last couple of weeks.AKIKO FUJITA: Ken Mahoney, Mahoney Asset Management CEO, good to have you on, on this Friday.KEN MAHONEY: All right, thank you. Have a great weekend.]"

Shares have added about 2.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Travelers due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Travelers Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates, Ups DividendThe Travelers Companies reported first-quarter 2023 core income of $4.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.64 and our estimate of $3.41. Shares gained 2.3% in the pre-market trading session to reflect the outperformance.However, the bottom line decreased 2.6% year over year. The year-over-year decline reflects higher catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. However, a higher underlying underwriting gain and higher net investment income were partial offsets.Behind Q1 HeadlinesTravelers’ total revenues increased 10% from the year-ago quarter to $9.7 billion, primarily driven by higher premiums. The top-line figure however missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.8 billion. Net written premiums increased 12% year over year to a record $9.4 billion, driven by strong growth across all three segments. The figure was higher than our estimate of $8.9 billion.Net investment income increased 4.1% year over year to $663 million, primarily due to higher income in the fixed-income investment portfolio. The figure was lower than our estimate of $683.7 million.Catastrophe losses totaled $422 million, wider than $36 million pre-tax in the prior-year quarter. Catastrophe losses primarily resulted from severe wind and hail storms in multiple states.Travelers witnessed an underwriting gain of $501 million, down 12.9% year over year.  The combined ratio deteriorated 410 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.4 due to higher catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio.Core return on equity contracted 100 basis points to 14.5%. Adjusted book value per share of $116.55 increased 4% year over year. Leverage improved 130 basis points to 24. At the end of the quarter, statutory capital and surplus was $23.7 billion.Story continuesSegment UpdateBusiness Insurance: Net written premiums increased 15% year over year to about $5.2 billion, benefiting from strong renewal premium change and retention as well as higher levels of new business. It beat our estimate of $4.5 billion. The combined ratio deteriorated 270 bps year over year to 93.6 due to higher catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio.Segment income of $756 million increased 13% year over year, driven by higher underlying underwriting gain, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. The figure was higher than our estimate of $444.1 million.Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums increased slightly year over year to $886 million, reflecting strong retention, new business and renewal premium change in management liability, as well as strong production in surety.  The figure was lower than our estimate of $909.2 million.The combined ratio deteriorated 200 bps year over year to 80, attributable to a higher underlying combined ratio and higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development.Segment income of $207 million decreased 4.6.% year over year due to a lower underlying underwriting gain, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development and higher net investment income. The figure was higher than our estimate of $181.7 million.Personal Insurance: Net written premiums of $3.4 billion increased 12% year over year, driven by higher pricing in both Domestic Automobile and Domestic Homeowners and Other. The figure was in line with our estimate. The combined ratio deteriorated 620 bps year over year to 101.5 due to higher catastrophe losses and a slightly higher underlying combined ratio, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development.Segment income was $83 million, a drop from $225 million earned in the year-ago quarter due to higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by a higher underlying underwriting gain and higher net favorable prior year reserve development.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateThis property &amp; casualty insurer returned $680 million to shareholders in the first quarter. It bought back 2.5 million shares for $462 million in the reported quarter. The board also approved an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1 per share, marking 19 consecutive years of dividend increase. The dividend will be paid out on Jun 30, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jun 9, 2023. It also approved a $5 billion share buyback program. This is in addition to the $1.605 billion that remained from the previous authorizations as of Mar 31, 2023How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Travelers has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Travelers has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

296,86f5d011-e3e1-31bb-be9b-66905273702a,GPC,2023-05-20,3 Promising Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-promising-stocks-buy-hand-180715872.html,1684174035,STORY,"['DLR', 'MELI', 'GPC']","[Thinking of stocks to buy hand over fist may seem foolish considering all the debt-ceiling drama or the possibility of the U.S. economy plunging into a recession. After all, willy-nilly investing isn’t a smart move no matter what the economic conditions are.Yet, targeted investments can still make sense. Even big bets on some stocks can be smart if the companies hold huge potential regardless of market conditions.Looking for such opportunities to ride out the storm can be a great way for investors to begin their research. The following three promising stocks stand out as no-brainer stocks to buy. Because they can help insulate your portfolio in a downdraft, they are ones you should consider grabbing with both hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is a fantastic stock to buy for U.S. investors concerned about a recession. The Latin American e-commerce and fintech giant has no exposure to our economy. It is wholly focused on Central and South American markets.Although an argument can be made that as goes the U.S., so goes the world, that’s not quite the case. MercadoLibre is experiencing accelerating growth. First-quarter gross merchandise volume (GMV), or the value of all goods sold on its online platform, rose 43% on a currency-adjusted basis to $9.4 billion. Total payment volume (TPV), or all the payments processed through its fintech platform Mercado Pago, nearly doubled to $37 billion.As much as e-commerce seems a mature industry stateside, in Latin America, e-commerce volume is forecast to grow 25% through 2025. And in MercadoLibre’s primary markets of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, Americas Market Intelligence forecasts the industry will expand 32%, 22% and 24%, respectively.At 56 times next year’s estimates, MercadoLibre’s stock may not seem cheap, but its profit margins are rapidly expanding. Gross margins exceeded 50% in the first quarter, and operating margins hit 11%, or almost double the year-ago rate. That makes the “Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America” one of the top promising stocks to buy hand over fist today.Story continuesDigital Realty Trust (DLR)A hallway with server racks on either side in a data centerSource: dotshock / ShutterstockCloud computing services are another inexorable force for long-term growth. Future Market Insights forecasts revenue for the global market growing from $564 billion in 2022 to some $4.4 trillion in 2033. That’s more than a 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) ought to be able to capitalize on that opportunity. Not your typical cloud computing stock, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is one of the biggest owners of data centers in the world. In fact, it has 314 data centers across 28 countries. It boasts approximately 38.8 million square feet of rentable space. Data centers essentially serve as the backbone of the internet. They provide the nerve center for everything that occurs in the cloud and online, from e-commerce to Internet of Things devices accessing their network. Data centers provide the warehousing for the servers and networking equipment in a secure environment. As companies continue to transition their data to the cloud, they’re going to need Digital Realty Trust to house it.Moreover, CEO Andy Power says the release of ChatGPT has ushered in a new focus on artificial intelligence. He told analysts it “could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale.”Digital Realty also offers leases that are longer than standard commercial leases. Its average remaining lease term is five years. Therefore, it has a level of assurance that its revenue will be stable over time in uncertain environments. For investors, it offers peace of mind.Genuine Parts (GPC)A stack of auto partsSource: ShutterstockIn contrast to MercadoLibre and Digital Realty, the third stock to grab onto with both hands may seem more mundane. Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) owns a 9,600-store retail chain that primarily operates under the NAPA Auto Parts banner. It also runs an industrial replacement parts and supplies distribution business that serves repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, and automobile and truck dealers.The auto industry is hurting. Sales fell 8.2% in 2022 to just 13.7 million units. That’s the lowest number since 2011, as automakers are giving fewer incentives, average new car prices are at a record $46,382, and rising interest rates make buying a new car more expensive.Used cars aren’t much better. While prices are off from their record highs last year, prices rose 4.4% in April. That follows nine straight months of decline. So amid rampant inflation, high financing costs and elevated gas prices, customers are opting to keep their old cars in working order.That’s reflected in Genuine Parts’ financial results. It had record sales of $22.1 billion last year, up 17%, with adjusted earnings rising over 20% to $8.34 per share. That continued in the first quarter as the auto parts retailer generated a record $5.1 billion in sales, a 9% increase. Meanwhile, profits soared 24.4% to $2.14 per share.Arguably the best reason to buy GPC stock is its dividend. It has made a payout for 75 consecutive years and raised the dividend every year for the last 67 years. That makes it a Dividend King, a stock that has increased its payout for 50 years or more. With the dividend yielding 2.2% annually, investors should feel comfortable buying this stalwart stock.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in GPC stock.

The 2% dip in paid Disney+ subscriptions is under the microscope, and investors have felt deflated following the development. Consequently, the stock has traded in the red.Disney: The Silver Linings Amid Streaming Subscription DipWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISTo be fair, the market seems fixated on the drop in low-value subscribers in its business. The positives during the quarter, including debt reduction, cost control initiatives and robust cash flow growth, are important and impressive undertakings.As the dust settles, the continued growth in streaming revenue and the irresistible charm of its theme parks should eventually wow investors again. There are invariably multiple bumps on the road, but it is imperative not to blur the bigger picture. Amid the challenges, Disney's vigorous commitment to cutting costs while expanding sales underscores a resilient business strategy.Moreover, based on its GF Value, the stock is a remarkably undervalued offering with monstrous upside potential. It is trading at significant discounts to its historical averages while its financials remain relatively rock-solid.Disney: The Silver Linings Amid Streaming Subscription DipStreaming business is actually in good shapePerhaps the biggest and most obvious knock on Disney has been the apparent drop in subscriber numbers for its Disney+ platform. The company missing expectations on the bottom line weighed down its results even further.To be fair, looking at the headline numbers, its paid subscribers are down considerably. After the first quarter, it had a whopping 157.8 million paid subscribers, which was down considerably from the 161.8 million subscribers it reported in the same quarter last year. At first glance, it would seem awful, but the bulk of the decline is attributable to its lowest-value international operations. In fact, its core Disney+ subscribers actually increased from 104.3 million t. 104.9 million; on top of that, it enjoyed a healthy bump in monthly average revenue per user from $3.93 to $4.44.Story continuesFurthermore, while Disney+ lost subscribers during the quarter, they were minuscule if we look at the price increase it has pushed through of late. The monthly price of the ad-free version of its streaming service was increased by 28%. These higher prices and lower costs led to a significant improvement in streaming profitability. Though its direct-to-consumer segment lost $659 million during the second quarter, it is a marked improvement from its loss of $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Additionally, Disney kept its expenses down from $200 million in the previous quarter.Moreover, the entertainment giant is looking to simplify streaming options for its customers by the conclusion of this year by combining its Disney+ and Hulu content. In curbing costs further, Disney plans to produce less content for its streaming services.Profitability situation is impressiveAnother major positive for Disney is its extraordinary profitability position despite being weighed down by market headwinds. It reported profits of 69 cents per share, which was significantly higher than the 26 cents per share it reported a year earlier. Conversely, it came roughly two cents per share lower than analyst estimates.The reported earnings per share culminated in massive net profits of $1.27 billion and a colossal improvement over the $470 million it reported a year earlier. Also, operational cash flows spiked from $1.77 billion to an amazing $3.24 billion.Disney's star of the show in its first quarter was its Parks, Experiences and Products segment, with sales growing 17% to $7.78 billion. Additionally, theme park admission sales shot up over 23%, while resort and vacation sales rose 34%. Naturally, this had plenty to do with the company's parks and domestic attendance, which increased by 7% on a year-over-year basis, while per capita guest spending increased by 2%. Hotel occupancy rates are at a spectacular 89% compared to 84% a year earlier.A glance at Disney's GuruFocus profile speaks volumes of how robust its profitability profile is compared to its peers. It boasts a profitability rank of 8 out of 10, with high profitability that may stay that way for the foreseeable future. Operating margins are at 10.4%, with nine years of profitability over the past decade. Its operating and net margins rank better than over 60% of companies in its peer group.The bottom lineDisney's second-quarter earnings report may have landed a punch in investors' gut, but it is far from being the knockout blow. The dip in Disney+ subscriptions shook market confidence, but it is just one part of the story. With effective debt reduction, diligent cost control and robust cash flow growth, the company has proven to be incredibly resilient. Moreover, it is tough to ignore the potential of streaming revenue and the enchanting charm of Disney's theme parks. These are seeds of future prosperity waiting to bloom.While the quarterly reduction in Disney+ subscribers raises eyebrows, a closer look reveals otherwise. The drop mostly stems from low-value international operations. Core Disney+ subscribers rose modestly, while average revenue per user got a healthy bump. Streaming profitability improved substantially with a strategic price hike and lower costs.Despite a minor miss on earnings per share, it netted massive profits of $1.27 billion, and operational cash flows jumped impressively. Therefore, it is imperative not to be swayed by the short-term turbulence; Disney's story is still one of remarkable resilience and potential.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

We spent a lot of time this week talking about retail. Let's take a look at the luxury consumer. High end retail has certainly been a standout now for some time.Higher income earners keep spending. Well, there's a headline out of the Journal today that Chanel is challenging Hermes in the bag war. Now, for the first time ever, Chanel's most popular handbag-- this is the classic flap handbag-- you're looking at the Birkin right now-- is the more expensive than an Hermes Birkin.OK, so the price of the Chanel bag up 75% in just the last three years. It costs less than $6,000, 2019. That's still very, very expensive today. It's going to set you back over 10,000 bucks. Chanel saying that the price hike is due to inflation and exchange rate shifts. Certainly outpacing inflation, Akiko, by quite a margin. And take a look at the company's results. It's privately owned, but they do release their annual results. Their profit margins went from 28% in 2019, all the way up to 35% in 2021. I would guess that they're still going to continue there to the upside, given the price of this bag.AKIKO FUJITA: Is it really about inflation? That's my question. I think part of this is about perception, right? The Birkin was the exclusive up there. Chanel wants to get to that level. And to that point, there's a number here that kind of stood out to me in the Journal article. The Birkin is only 6% more than it was prepandemic level.So why is Chanel outpacing that? There's a number of ways to work that. You could limit the number of bags. You could raise the price a little more. I mean, to me, luxury is all about perception. And Chanel is trying to reach that Birkin level.Story continuesALLIE CANAL: I just don't know if they can. I mean, the Birkin bag, that's like woven into pop culture references all over. I mean, I think this is also a story about the strength and resiliency of the luxury consumer. They are willing to pay these higher prices, despite inflation, despite these price hikes, whatever you want to call it.Now, this stat from the article stood out to me. The Chanel model was $4,000 cheaper prepandemic to the Birkin in the US. Now, today, it's only $200 less. And the pandemic was not that long ago. So the fact that they're increasing these prices that dramatically is just crazy to me. I don't know if I could ever justify spending over 10 grand for a handbag.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, I wish that this is a dilemma that I actually had, which of these bags to go for. Maybe one day, though. Pras, you're a luxury guy.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yesterday, you guys complained about the watches that I was talking about being too expensive. You guys are like, $10,000 handbags, my God. Well, I mean, I know the Birkin. Even I know the Birkin-- very, very popular. I did not know about the--SEANA SMITH: You're fancy guy-- makes sense.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, right. I didn't know about this flat bag, but I'm not surprised about the--SEANA SMITH: Flat bag.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --relentless bid up in pricing because I'm seeing that in the car world. The Rolls-Royce CEO told me, the Bentley CEO told me, they are charging more and more for their cars. People are paying for that, including customization, stuff that makes their products more unique. People want to pay more and more for that because they want to have that thing that stands out. And maybe-- I don't know about this, but maybe there's some purses out there that will make you stand out in the crowd.SEANA SMITH: I think they're just trying to be a little bit more exclusive, Chanel. And they want to rival Hermes Birkin bag. I don't know if they'll get there, though.ALLIE CANAL: I don't know. But in the meantime, the richer just keep getting richer, I guess. Moving on to my story, it's Disney, the stock falling today about 2% on the heels of a fresh Wall Street downgrade. Macquarie analyst Tim Nolan downgraded shares to neutral from outperform, citing linear network declines, direct-to-consumer hurdles, and the slowing parks business. He sees those near-term uncertainties weighing on earnings, valuation, and sentiment, adding he's concerned about Disney's ability to reach streaming profitability by 2024, which is the company's current target.And part of that reason for that view is the likely purchase of Hulu from Comcast, which currently controls 1/3 of the streamer, along with those sequential subscriber declines. And then ESPN, guys, that's just an issue lurking in the background. The Wall Street Journal reporting Disney is currently laying the groundwork for that over-the-top service, which Iger has said will happen, but analysts now are saying the process to get there is going to be incredibly bumpy.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I want to just touch on quickly. We talked about ESPN yesterday. But the theme parks is very interesting to me in the sense that I read a tweet just now by Conor Sen at Bloomberg talking about how Disney built Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Typhoon Lagoon, Animal Kingdom, and California Adventure between 1982 and 2001, and they haven't built anything since, the only big thing being the Star Wars theme park. So there's like a--SEANA SMITH: Which they're closing.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right, they're close-- so there's a capacity issue there. More people want to spend money on these types of vacations and experiential things. And there hasn't been that much built out. Las Vegas has only had one major casino built since 2010. There's actually a capacity issue when it comes to those types of vacations. And maybe Disney is there to deliver that and also maybe charge higher prices.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, you know, Allie, when you mentioned the streaming profitability, the timeline there, that's an interesting one for me to watch because so much of this is about an arms race. If you say-- if Netflix says we're going to spend more, then, of course, Disney is going to match that. That's been where it's been going. Now we're starting to see a bit of a pullback in spending in content. And yet, here we are, talking about the crowded streaming landscape. At the end of the day, you do have to compete on content, and you do have to put money up if you are trying to win out in that.So there's a bit of a balancing act, it feels like, that's happening right now that's not specific to Disney. But I'm curious, now that we are in this environment of a bit of a pullback, a bit of a slowdown, how the other streaming sites also respond because at the end of the day, when you look down the line, you still want to be in a position of strength. In order to be in that position, you've got to churn out content.SEANA SMITH: You've got to churn out content. You've got to have the subscribers that are willing to pay for whatever you charge for your service. It will be interesting when we talk about the slowing economy right now, whether or not people are going to cut down on the number of subscriptions that they have and who, of course, will then take the brunt of that. When it comes to the parks business, and Pras, you brought that up here, it's amazing to me in this type of economy that people are spending, and they're spending as much as it costs to go and spend a weekend--ALLIE CANAL: They're buying Birkin bags and then going to Disney.SEANA SMITH: And Birkin bags and they're going to Disney. I mean, that's what it sounds like. It will set you back hundreds and hundreds of dollars per person.AKIKO FUJITA: That is ultra ultimate luxury. If you're taking a Birkin bag to go to Disneyland, you're doing just fine. And that is a divide we're talking about. But I don't know. Maybe there are people that are doing that.SEANA SMITH: Oh, there's Star Wars hotel. What, was it 4,800 bucks for a weekend for a couple? That's pretty high end luxury to me.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah.AKIKO FUJITA: That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. We'll end it there. Let's talk about this other thing that I'm watching right now-- Instagram set to launch a text-based app that will compete directly with Twitter. And the app could be released as early as this summer.Now, according to details that were first released on the Substack newsletter ICYMI, In Case You Missed It, the platform will allow users to post text updates of up to 500 characters. Users will be able to attach videos of up to five minutes long, and the app is going to be decentralized here. This is going to be compatible with other apps like Mastodon. Bloomberg reports Meta's already testing the product with influencers and some creators.And we go back to where things were at the very beginning when Elon Musk bought Twitter. How many of those users moved away? I'm curious how many of those users, now Meta, Instagram, can bring on board because there are a lot of creators out there that are looking for a newer platform, where they feel like it's a little safer, they feel like there's more of a discourse. I don't know. Something you guys would try out?SEANA SMITH: Well, I think the fact the safety features that they laid out, just in terms of you can regulate who is able to reply to you, you're able to control some of your followers, features that are not available right now on Twitter, that's what I think could potentially set this service apart from what we have today on Twitter.But when we take a look at Twitter's user base, they've been struggling now for some time to continue to grow that user base. This could make sense, but you've got to question what the future looks like for a service like this, for a platform, and how many people are actually going to leave Twitter and go there. I don't know. It makes sense from a creator's perspective, though, I think.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, and they haven't figured out how to monetize it yet. That's the big question on this new platform.ALLIE CANAL: Exactly, and to me, the Twitter brand is just so strong. And we've seen other competitors try and come to market. They haven't been able to gain the same traction. You could also argue, though, that now is a good time to debut something, considering a lot of users are frustrated with all these changes under the leadership of Elon Musk. That's about to change soon.But one thing that stuck out to me was the character limit. I think 500 characters might be the sweet spot. Twitter's original character limit was 140. They doubled that in 2017 to 280. So that's something new, but yeah, to your point, I just don't know how they're going to be able to lure these users onto the platform. I guess it starts with the influencers. If you can get Gen Z, you can have access to a lot more people, but we'll see. I'm not fully convinced at this point. And do we need another social media service? Personally, I don't think so.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, I mean, what's the motto? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. And that's Zuckerberg's motto, right? I mean, he copies everything. He makes it maybe better. I don't know. When I saw the actual screenshots for the Instagram version of Twitter, it looked just like Twitter. I mean, it was almost exactly the same.And I have to ask myself, I like Instagram because I like the picture oriented, image oriented nature of it. I don't want to be writing big 500-word essays and stuff like that. I think I want to use it mostly for image. But I could be wrong. Maybe like these more influencer people will come on there and maybe want to do more interaction that way. Maybe Elon will turn off more people who will want to use Instagram for that tweeting nature.Anyway, for my take here, my roundtable pick, big news out of GM, the automaker announcing its Silverado EV work truck that's meant for Fleet customers will now top out at 450 miles of range. That's an improvement over the 400 mile prior estimate. Great for Fleet operators who want to value range over niceties like touch screens and air suspension. But the range topper will set those back around $80,000. So it's not cheap there.But GM does say the cheapest Silverado EV work truck will come in around 41,000, so. But we won't know what the range is. So there is a cheap option there, probably about half to a bit more than half of range there. But it is interesting to see That This truck will have 100 miles more range than its nearest competitor, which is the F-150 Lightning or the Rivian with the large battery pack. So kind of a big deal here in that EV pickup space.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, range anxiety is a real thing, right? I mean, and especially, Pras, I'd be curious to get your thoughts here because anything over 300, I feel like is kind of the comfort zone for those who haven't necessarily gone all in on EVs. When you talk about trucks, you've got to go even more than that because you figure those who are currently driving ICE trucks are harder to convert over to the EV side.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, I mean, if you can-- 300 miles is usually considered like the psychological barrier of what people are willing to live with. 400 miles, 450 miles, I mean, people don't want to drive that much in a single day, let alone a single trip, right? So what we're seeing is that could be the range that could help people out.But also, in the future, you could see trucks at lower range, but the ability to fill up much faster, like, in gas station time. So that could be the future, too. So we're going to see how that works out right now, but GM is sort of throwing down the gauntlet here with that 450 plus mile range.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. I think a lot of the talk here ahead of this news was that Chevy was late to this when it comes to the Silverado, given the fact that the F-150 Lightning has been out now for quite some time. But it might have been worth the wait, given the fact that a lot of people, like you guys are saying, range anxiety is such a huge thing. And the fact that you could get 450 miles here before you have to recharge is certainly a differentiating factor.I am curious, though, what the growth trajectory looks like when it comes to EV pickup trucks because I'm with you, Akiko. I would think the pickup driver would be one of the last to convert to EVs, but maybe I'm wrong.ALLIE CANAL: I agree with that. I mean, to me, it's-- I'm not a car person, but I understand the importance of mileage and of these fleets, especially when you're talking about commercial industries. So I guess we'll have to see. But it's certainly a hotly competitive market. So this doesn't surprise me.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And Ford's having a tough time keeping up with their reservations, so maybe they'll prove us all wrong.]"

Shares have added about 5.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is F5 due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.F5 Networks' Q2 Earnings and Sales Top EstimatesF5 reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.This Seattle-based company’s non-GAAP earnings of $2.53 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42. The bottom line increased 18.8% from the year-ago quarter’s $2.13 per share and was way higher than management’s guided range of $2.36-$2.48 per share.During the reported quarter, F5 Networks witnessed a 11% increase in its revenues amid a global chip shortage scenario in the semiconductor industry. The company’s non-GAAP revenues were $703.2 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $700.7 million. The top line was above the mid-point of the guided range of $690-$710 million.Top Line in DetailProduct revenues (48.4% of total revenues), which comprise Software and Systems sub-divisions, increased 14% year over year to $340.6 million. System sales jumped 43% year over year to $209 million, accounting for approximately 61.3% of the total Product revenues. However, Software revenues slumped 13% to $132 million, making up the remaining 38.7% of the total Product revenues.Global Service revenues (51.6% of total revenues) grew 8% to $362.6 million.F5 Networks registered sales growth across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions, witnessing a year-over-year increase of 7%, 22% and 9%, respectively. Revenue contributions from the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions were 54%, 27% and 18%, respectively.Story continuesCustomer-wise, Enterprises, Service providers and Government represented 67%, 13% and 20% of product bookings, respectively.MarginsGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins contracted 220 basis points (bps) and 250 bps to 77.9% and 80.4%, respectively.GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses went up 1.9% and 4.6%, respectively, to $441.5 million and $374.1 million. F5 Networks’ GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins expanded 330 bps and 70 bps to 15.1% and 27.2%, respectively.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowF5 Networks exited the March-ended quarter with cash and short-term investments of $755.3 million compared with the previous quarter’s $660 million.During the fiscal second quarter, the company generated $141 million of operating cash flow compared with the $158 million reported in the previous quarter. The operating cash flow remained under pressure due to strong multi-year subscription sales, which impacted the cash collection process.GuidanceF5 Networks projects non-GAAP revenues in the $690-$710 million (mid-point of $700 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share in the $2.78-$2.90 band (mid-point of $2.84) for third-quarter fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecast to be around 82%.For fiscal 2023, F5 Networks expects low-to-mid-single digit revenue growth.The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings to grow in 7-11% band. NonGAAP operating margin is forecasted to be roughly 30%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, F5 has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, F5 has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.47bUS$2.94bUS$3.04bUS$3.13bUS$3.22bUS$3.30bUS$3.37bUS$3.45bUS$3.53bUS$3.61bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Est @ 2.93%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.39%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.25%Est @ 2.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.3kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$78bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$78b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$40bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$62b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$79.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Colgate-Palmolive, there are three important aspects you should further research:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Colgate-Palmolive .Future Earnings: How does CL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(Operator Instructions) Now to turn the call over to [Josh Centalli], Investor Relations Director of Greenland. Mr. [Centalli], please proceed.Thank you, operator and hello, everyone. Welcome to Greenland Technologies First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today is Mr. Raymond Wang, Chief Executive Officer.We released results earlier today. The press release is available on the company's IR website at gtec-tech.com as well as from Newswire Services. A replay of this call will also be available in a few hours on our IR website.Before we continue, please note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As such, the company's actual results may be materially different from the expectations expressed today.Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is included in the company's public filings with the SEC. The company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required under applicable law. Also, please note that unless otherwise stated, all figures mentioned during the conference call are in U.S. dollars. With that, let me now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Raymond Wang. Please go ahead. Mr. Wang.Raymond WangThank you, [Josh]. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I will be handling a majority of this call as my CFO, Jing Jin has lost his voice and is no condition to contribute to today's call.I'd like to start by thanking our global team for continuing to drive the business during a difficult global market and continuing to develop a more efficient operation. As expected, and stated during our last earnings call. Our component business continues to recover from global market conditions in the first quarter.Again, this is due to the current market conditions and the material handling and manufacturing industry in China as OEMs recover and ramp up from the country's zero tolerance policy. Now China's manufacturing PMI has fallen to 49.5 this year, which is below estimates of 50.3 showing a slower recovering on the fears of a global slowdown.However, based on feedback from our clients in the component business and our internal estimates, we still stand by our -- we still stand by our forecasts that our business will normalize and grow especially in the second half of this year. The material handling industry continues to grow with demand reaching all-time highs. Grandview research recently increased their forecasts of the global forklift market to a compound annual growth rate of 13.2% through 2030, with a greater shift towards electric forklifts due to increased emission regulations around the world.As a market leader in the forklift drive train and transmission industry, this market growth will reflect on our own metrics and results. And as we are ready to capitalize on this demand with our advanced components for all forklift and material handling systems. As displayed in our results, we continue to improve our margins through product innovation, lower costs, and operational efficiencies. Gross margins are up 320 basis points to 24.9% compared to last year. These improvements will further contribute to a successful 2023 as the market recovers and accelerates later this year.Switching to our heavy electric industrial, heavy machinery business, we continue to make strides laying the foundation for the company. We recently recruited the new Chief Operating Officer Dana Hopkins, who has really hit the ground running and is developing the infrastructure we need to succeed. It has always been our responsibility as a pioneer to educate the heavy machinery industry on the advantages of electric compared to traditional fossil fuel systems. And we continue to see great success in this area. We have more and more organizations signing up for pilots and demos of our product.Having participated in three industry trade shows this quarter alone, where we were met with tremendous interest at each one. Speaking with attendees and learning how our products can improve their operations always fuels my perspective, that the demand for electric heavy equipment is there, and heavy is on the right path to capture this opportunity. But I understand that heavy needs to move and advance faster toward their milestones, so we will adapt our strategy accordingly.As we develop and deploy our network of authorized service providers, we will incorporate a new referral incentive to leverage their network to uncover and close new opportunities. This will increase the effectiveness of our sales personnel with warm leads and open new doors. Heavy will explore new markets for our product line that can benefit from clean operations industries such as property maintenance, landscaping, and utility companies to name a few.This also lends itself to exploring new market territories, both domestically and internationally that possess significant opportunity. And we will be doing so in a prudent and calculated manner as to not take us away from our focus on establishing our presence in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.We have received interest in our products from companies in these industries at various trade shows, and we will begin to expand our marketing to target them accordingly. Heavy has also received a lot of feedback expressing interest in other heavy machinery, they would benefit greatly from electrification.These opportunities are worth further research and market study, and may lead to an expansion of our product line sooner than we originally planned. I am proud of the work that the GTEC team has accomplished. There is still more work to be done and milestones to be achieved. And I believe we are on the right track to reach those goals.And with that, let me dive into the financial results for the first quarter of 2023. As always, please refer to our earnings filings for full details of our financial results. So, for the first quarter 2023, total revenue was $22.1 million, a decrease of 24% from 29.3 million a year ago, largely due to logistical and supply chain challenges resulting from the initial wave of COVID cases following the end of China's zero COVID policies and significant pent-up travel demands during this year's Chinese New Year holiday.In addition, revenue was impacted by a stronger dollar relative to the Chinese yen on an RMB basis excluding the impact of the foreign exchange, total revenue decreased by about 18% from the previous year.And we sold 36,841 transmission products -- product units sorry, compared with 41,902 units in the first quarter of 2022. Our cost of goods sold fell 28% to 16.6 million in Q1 2023. Primarily due to lower sales volume. Gross profit was 5.5 million, compared with 6.4 million in Q1 2022. However, driven by a strategic transition in Greenland's product mix towards a higher value component and more sophisticated products like hydraulic transmissions, our gross margin rose 320 basis points to 24.9% from 21.7% a year ago.Meanwhile, total operating expenses increased 5% year over year to 3.1 million. The company has focused on significantly streamlining costs over the past year, which is mostly offset increases in research and development, investment and marketing activities related to the company's expansion. Our income from operations was 2.4 million compared with 3.4 million in Q1 2022. Net income was 2.5 million compared with 2.9 million in Q1 2022.As of the end of March, our balance sheet remains strong with 15.4 million cash on hand, an increase of 125% from a year earlier. With solid financials and sound growth strategies, we are confident in our ability to grow both the core transmission business as well as our heavy division as we deliver significant value for our shareholders. And with that, that concludes our prepared remarks. I'm going to open the call up for questions. So, operator, please, you may go ahead.Story continuesQuestion and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) First question comes from the line of Theodore O'Neill from Litchfield Hills Research. Please go ahead.Theodore O'NeillGood morning. Congratulations on the good quarter.Raymond WangThank you.Theodore O'NeillYes. And so, I think you were saying this on the call. But as you experienced slower growth in China, can you pivot your resort -- more resources towards heavy?Raymond WangYes, we can and we actually have been. Part of our focus right now is expanding the team, accelerating the expansion of our team and talent to be able to execute on our vision.This is very important for us to be able to properly capitalize on the opportunities that we've been uncovering. So, we have been investing further in that aspect of it. And we anticipate further investment as well also a little sooner than we originally -- initially planned in both our marketing efforts, our sales and marketing efforts and on our territory and expansion.Theodore O'NeillAnd you mentioned gross margin improvement here from product mix. Does that reflect on anything permanent? And related to that, do you have any pricing pressure in this in that channel?Raymond WangA great question. So, a big portion of the product switchover towards our higher margin is actually based on the shift in the market towards lithium powered forklifts in particular, our highest margin yet most expensive transmission that we offer is our drive train units specifically catered towards lithium powered forklifts. And because on a global scale, OEMs on the market are switching over to lithium, that's been really driving our product.And right now, it's actually a premier product still, just like with our traditional, both hydraulic and transmissions to support fossil fuel forklifts, we've always been the premier product from a cost standpoint, but that has not driven away our clientele.Theodore O'NeillThank you very much.OperatorFor the questions, one moment for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Rommel Dionisio from Aegis Capital. Please go ahead.Rommel DionisioGood morning. Thank you. Raymond, I knew you were involved in -- on the heavy side with some pilot programs, United Rentals and so forth. And you also presented a, I believe, a trade show in New York recently. I wonder if you could just share with us some of the initial feedback to the extent that you can on some of these pilot programs, as well as the trade shows you've been attending? Thank you.Raymond WangAbsolutely. So, with our United Rentals pilot, they have truly been enjoying the equipment, they've been getting a lot of positive feedback and their sales teams have always been excited to travel over to the location where it stores to learn more about it and see how they can introduce that to their clientele.And it's gone so well that the company United Rentals has both requested an extension of our pilot and additional products as well to demo. Right now, they have our GEL-5000 are long -- our largest and most popular unit. But our GEL-5000, we've been getting so much demand for our product line for both product demos and pilots that we actually are shuffling around our inventory to be able to properly meet that demand.It's been a little more of a challenge than we anticipated logistically to support this influx of requests for our products across both New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware, and New York and Pennsylvania, just to name a few. But what we're doing now is instead of catering towards individual single demos, we are actually looking to initiate a campaign where we do more product demo days to invite multiple organizations at once.With an opportunity to be able to drive experience our equipment, utilize it to move some material, truly feel it out. And coupled that with a stronger and smoother sales, upper operation and process, we hope that will be a more effective use of our equipment to generate sales.Rommel DionisioOkay. Maybe just a quick follow up. I know your 54,000 square foot facility in Baltimore, was supposed to eventually produce over 500 units annually. I think you were targeting first you just roll off in second quarter the assembly line, roll off the assembly line. Is that still on track?Raymond WangYes, we are still on track for that. The first units will be a GEX-8000, which is our electric excavator, and a GEL-5000, our largest and most popular front loader.Rommel DionisioGreat. Thank you, Raymond. And by the way, want to wish Jing -- J.J. a quick recovery. Thank you.Raymond WangThank you very much. Thank you very much. He'll be glad to hear that. Thank you.OperatorThank you for the questions. The next question comes from the line of Graham Mattison from Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.Graham MattisonHi. Good morning, Raymond. Quick question on the quarter. So I mean, the first quarter financial results, and certainly the best quarter that you guys have had in the last three. So it looks like things are recovering in the Chinese market. Are you still seeing quarter three and quarter four to be the banner quarters you've thought before? And what gives you that confidence?Raymond WangYes, I do still see the third and fourth quarter being the strongest of the year for us. And I still am optimistic that 2023 will be a banner year for our core component business.That is primarily due to the trend that I outlined last earnings call where the zero-COVID policy lifting in China was truly devastating to the entire region, but particularly in the manufacturing sense. And it caused a big gap in the production cycle for a lot of the OEMs that at that time were even just trying to come back from shutdowns and aggressive policies to try to control the pandemic.So, majority of our clients were -- has been overcoming a lot of bumps and bruises in their operations at the end of 2022, but the demand is there, it's stronger than ever. They are still revving up and ready to go. And it's just part of the ramp up cycle. So because of that, it's not a fast process for them to get everything up and running so quickly, but the flow is beginning to normalize as we're seeing in our results. And as they ramp up, then our deliveries will execute and we've been ready to go.Graham MattisonGreat. And then coming out of the COVID lock downs, do you see any changes in the competitive positioning and competitive landscape of the market for the transmission business?Raymond WangInitially, we did. So during, I'd say, end of 2021 through mostly 2022, we started to see a shift of our sales start to move outside of China. Still a majority was in China, we're talking a switch from a few percent, let's say, from about 96% at the beginning of 2022 to about 91%, 92% towards the middle. So we were seeing some trends that a lot of OEMs are trying to shift their manufacturing outside of the country of China.However, now that the manufacturers are starting to rev up and I think that because of challenges that they experienced in the international markets who still needed more time investment and expertise to ramp up their manufacturing opportunities, we're actually seeing it come right back. So right now, again, a majority of our sales are entirely to Chinese OEMs right around the 97%, 97%, 98%, again.Graham MattisonAll right, great. And then one last question and that's great with the feedback that you're getting at the trade shows as you're talking to people. Can you just walk us through the sort of process there? When you get a potential customer coming in saying they're really interested at it, what's the next step is that they come and do a demo? Or do you get a product on their site? Do you just get some sense around how long the sales cycle it typically is in the industry for you?Raymond WangYes. So, this is difficult to compare to industry average sales cycle because for the heavy industrial machinery industry, it's actually just led by a very small handful of players with very strong brand recognition. So besides, let's say -- it's almost similar to politics for certain classes of machinery, you either go one brand or another brand. That's about it.Graham MattisonYes.Raymond WangSo because of that, they have a much faster sales process. And it's focused more on delivery and service. Now, for our side, we have to overcome the big challenge of educating getting people comfortable with the brand-new technology.But that actually is driving a lot of the interest that we see in the trade shows because people will double take every time when they see our machinery and then learn it, it's electric. And then they get a buzz with questions. How long does it last? How do you charge it? How much does it cost? And these are the questions that really showcase the advantages and benefits of our product line. So it gets them very excited.Now, our traditional sales process that we're pursuing is from the interest that we received, we would schedule a demo on the client's site to get -- provide them with an opportunity to be able to utilize the vehicle, see the power, really envision how it can support their operations, and go from there. But the challenge was, from a logistical standpoint, this was expensive and slow. We were doing multi day demos.So in many cases, an asset would be at that prospect site for a week plus while we have others waiting in the line. For example, just last week, we were at the New York fleet show in Queens, New York.And from that show, we actually walked away with over two dozen requests for demos and pilots from organizations around the New York City area. So if we were to do it one by one, we were finding it was just too slow. So we are changing it up. And now, we're actually looking to do more of a group demo and pilot for just a few hours or on-site demos for no longer than a day.Graham MattisonGot it. And then as the -- one question to add in. As you're starting to roll more equipment off the line beginning in 2Q, will that help that demo process?Raymond WangYes. Yes, it will. It will. As it stands right now, our entire fleet is just dedicated to demos and we still have a pipeline right now of over 100 different organizations that are waiting for their turn for the vehicle -- with their machines, I'm sorry.Graham MattisonGot it. All right. Great. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you very much.Raymond WangThank you for the questions.OperatorThank you for the questions. Seeing no more questions in the queue, let me turn the call back to Mr. Wang for closing remarks.Raymond WangSo everyone, I just wanted to thank everyone again for participating in our call and continuing to follow the progress of our company. We are on the path for great things. Though it may not reflect in our stock value, I still strongly believe that our company is -- possesses significant value for our shareholders and the opportunity and the timing where that will become recognized is surely coming down the line.So, I just want to thank everyone again for participating on our call. I want to thank my team for continuing to work so hard every day to deliver this value to our shareholders. And I hope everyone has a fantastic rest of your day.OperatorThank you all again. This concludes the call. You may now disconnect.]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Other major memory chip makers such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron Technology are expected to follow suit and raise NAND prices by a similar range, according to Taiwanese IT media DigiTimes.Micron, the biggest US memory chip maker - and currently under a Chinese cybersecurity review - told distributors this month that it will not accept inquiries for DRAM and NAND flash products below current market prices, the report said.""These moves indicate that these companies believe the market has reached its bottom and that the imbalance of supply and demand is gradually easing,"" said Wang Lifu, an analyst at research group ICwise.""Since last year, several manufacturers have shut down their factories for a few days each month to control the supply, but they might not adopt the production reduction strategy after May,"" Wang said. ""However, whether the price of NAND will remain at its lowest level for [longer] or rebound quickly in the future is uncertain.""NAND flash is a type of non-volatile storage technology that retains data even without power, making it ideal for electronics products such as smartphones, tablets, laptop computers and solid-state drives.Story continuesYMTC's 64-layer 3D NAND flash memory chips on a 300mm silicon wafer. Photo: Handout alt=YMTC's 64-layer 3D NAND flash memory chips on a 300mm silicon wafer. Photo: Handout&gt;YMTC's price increase comes ahead of market anticipation about a rebound in the sector, which is expected to gradually stabilise in the second half of this year.The move is also seen by industry insiders as a positive step towards reversing the downward pricing trend that has been fuelled by global economic headwinds, declining market demand, and excess inventories.Since the second quarter of last year, global NAND prices have fallen by up to 25 per cent as supply chains scrambled to clear inventories, according to research company TrendForce.In a March report, TrendForce said prices fell by 10 to 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year due to oversupply as demand for products such as servers, smartphones, and laptops was weak, adding that prices ""will have an opportunity to rebound in the fourth quarter if demand remains stable"".K. S. Pua, chief executive of Phison Electronics, a Taiwanese NAND flash supplier, said further price cuts were ""not viable"" and some suppliers may face bankruptcy if the market did not recover, according to DigiTimes.Analysts predict that leading flash memory makers including Kioxia, Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Western Digital have suffered combined losses of more than US$10 billion after they had to cut prices.Cheng Weihua, YMTC's chief operating officer, told a forum in late March that supply and demand in the global NAND flash market ""will reach a balance in the second half of the year"", primarily on the back of orders from makers of smartphones, servers and personal computers.Of the most popular solid state drives (SSDs) offered on Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com, Samsung 1-TB SSDs are going for 559 yuan (US$79.50), while some smaller brands are offering 2-TB SSDs for less than 500 yuan.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks. 2023 was a tough year for some sectors of the stock market, or at least for some sectors. The market has had a tumultuous couple of years, which started with the outbreak of the coronavirus. The pandemic cut stock markets' value by nearly one third, but the resulting recovery was equally stunning as well. The recovery proved to be a boon for the technology sector, as lockdowns grew the demand for their products. Whether it was retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), who helped people do their shopping from home, or firms like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), whose computing products surged into consumer's hands, or even companies like Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), who surged on the stock market when the demand for remote work and video conferencing boomed, the post-pandemic stock market recovery was a great time to be in technology stocks.Yet, as they say, all good things must come to an end - so did this good fortune for the technology companies on the stock market. In 2022 as the after effects of the expansionary fiscal policies of the pandemic government and the Russian invasion of Ukraine made their mark, technology companies dropped on the market and bled investors dry. Yet, it appears as if hedge funds are now taking these price drops as an opportunity to buy on the dip. This has been the trend in some of the hedge fund portfolios that we have analyzed so far after their filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed portfolio compositions. For instance, billionaire David Tepper's 2023 portfolio has several new stock additions that are technology companies. These include NVIDIA and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), alongside a 390% growth in investment in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Another popular hedge fund that increased exposure to the technology industry is Bill Ackman's Pershing Square which took up a cumulative $1.06 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Story continuesThis trend, as you'll find out today, is also present when we look at another billionaire hedge fund manager's investment portfolio for Q1 2023. This manager is Dan Loeb who heads the hedge fund Third Point Management. Third Point is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with its portfolio currently worth $6.1 billion according to Insider Monkey's research. The portfolio's size is yet to reach the level at which it stood by the end of Q1 2022, but is slowly growing to touch the previous levels.Like some of his other hedge fund peers, Mr. Loeb is also a billionaire with Forbes Magazine placing his latest net worth estimate at $3.5 billion. His hedge fund employs a variety of trading strategies on the financial markets. These include activist investments, venture capital investments, structured and corporate credit strategies, and long and short equity investments. This enables the firm to take a look at the debt strategies of companies to leverage them to its advantage, profit from corporate management weaknesses, and capitalize on share price movements in both directions.As for Mr. Loeb, he started tinkering with the stock market during his time in high school and continued it into college as well. He was initially quite successful, and during his time at Columbia University, he would end up making $120,000. Yet, his inexperience in the stock market made him invest all of it into a medical equipment company to lose the winnings - an occurrence that would provide him practical experience about the perils of placing all your eggs in a single basket. Before setting up Third Point Management in 1995, he would work in the financial and corporate world for a decade.He's quite popular in the investment world as well, especially when it comes to letter writing. His latest letter was sent to the embattled firm Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. The letter criticized the firm's chairwoman and shared:Since our engagement with Ms. Nash began, we have detected a pronounced aversion to including a shareholder representative on the Board. At the same time as we identified Ms. Brady, we proposed a fellow shareholder with impeccable credentials as a second candidate. This individual has years of public market experience, an exemplary record as a corporate director of a larger company, and a strong relationship with one of the top consumer investment companies in the world. Ms. Nash, who was presumably speaking on behalf of the Board, gave unconvincing explanations for rejecting this candidate.Shortly after rebuffing our candidate, and within a week of accepting Lucy Brady (though, oddly without recognizing our role in proposing her), yesterday, the Company hastily announced the appointment of Steve Voskuil to the Board. While we recognize Mr. Voskuil’s financial experience, this Board’s handpicked new director does not assuage our concerns about substantial corporate governance shortcomings. It is further concerning that the Board added a shareholder-identified candidate without being fully transparent about the process that led to her selection.It seems as if this Board is operating in triage mode rather than via best corporate governance practices. We fear the reason that the Board is reacting this way is because they (and others) have many reasons to close the curtain before shareholders can take a closer look at what transpired on their watch.So, wondering what's on Mr. Loeb's mind these days? Well, you came to the right place as we look at precisely that in this article, with some top picks being HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Salesforce, Inc.

The company said its planned plant in Hiroshima would enable the next wave of advanced chip innovation, such as 1-gamma node memory chips, from 2025.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.In a statement, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called Micron's investment ""a great case of Japan-US semiconductor cooperation"".Micron's big bets in Japan mark a sharp contrast to its souring relationship with China, where it disbanded its chip design team in Shanghai last year even though the market accounted for 11 per cent of its sales. Micron products are currently being investigated by Beijing on national security concerns.Japan's courting of global chip manufacturers follows similar efforts by allies like the US, European Union and, to a lesser extent, the UK, which are using money to entice semiconductor firms to relocate to their respective markets, according to Gareth Leather, senior emerging Asia economist with Capital Economics in London.Story continuesWhile Japan was once a major player in the global semiconductor industry with over half of the market share in 1988, Taiwan now makes the majority of the world's semiconductors, including over 80 per cent of the most advanced chips, according to experts.However, growing geopolitical tensions between the US and China are pushing developed countries to diversify chip sourcing away from Taiwan, Leather said.TrendForce, a global tech market intelligence provider, predicts that Taiwan's advanced chip process capacity will drop to 71 per cent by 2025, down 9 per cent from 2022.U.S. President Joe Biden delivers a speech at a ceremony celebrating the construction of a TSMC factory in Phoenix, Arizona, in December 2022.

Recipient companies of the funding will be barred from building ""leading-edge"" chip factories in China for 10 years, a move seen to be designed to counter the country's technological advancement.The US also leads a semiconductor alliance with Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, called ""Fab 4"" or ""Chip 4"", which experts say could further disrupt China's position in the global chip supply chain. The alliance held its first meeting in February, focused on semiconductor supply chain resilience and future cooperation.As the four partners deepen their cooperation, TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker, said on Thursday it would continue to invest in Japan, according to the Taipei Times.The firm is already building a government-subsidised factory in Japan in partnership with Sony Corp.A wafer seen as at a ceremony held by TSMC to mark the start of mass production of its most advanced 3-nanometer chips in Tainan, Taiwan, in December 2022.

BrandsYum! Brands, Friday, May 19, 2023, Press release pictureHut LifeAs part of our journey to build a ‘Culture of Connection' that is more equitable, inclusive and where everyone feels like they belong, we are kicking off our ""Slice of Life"" employee spotlight series.Through this new series, we will learn about our fellow Team Members unique backgrounds, life experiences, different cultures, and the interesting journey they've taken to get to Pizza Hut, allowing us to know a little bit more about those we work with.Kicking off our series, we sat down with Trish Baney, director of training, who has been with Pizza Hut for more than 30 years.Tell us about yourself - where are you from and what is your background/ethnicity/culture?""I grew up in Nebraska, but I'm a city girl - not a farm girl. Although I did spend some time with my grandparents on their farm in Iowa. I loved growing up in the Mid-west, where deep seeded family values and strong work ethic are the foundation of all parts of life - including mine. I have been married to my husband Chad for 29 years and we have two sons, one granddaughter and three dogs. My Pizza Hut journey started more than 30 years ago where I started as a Team Member in a restaurant and have now worked my way up through the organization to our training team today. I have had the opportunity to work on the equity, franchise, licensee, and multi-brand sides of business. And I've met incredible people every step of the way.""When you were younger, what did you want to be?""A dancer. My mom was a dance teacher and had her own studio. I started dancing when I was three and being a dancer was at the top of my list until I was a teenager.""Why do you do what you do?""My passion is people. Invest in those around you and everyone is better for it. There is no greater value I can add than helping others become the best version of themselves. By doing that, each of those people also leave something with me to help me grow.""Story continuesWhat was a defining moment in your career journey?""There have been quite a few, but I would have to say making the move from Nebraska to Dallas in 1996, when I was a restaurant general manager (RGM), was the first. Moving from a small market in my home state to one of the largest in a state where I knew no one, was terrifying. But the opportunities that came along with it, for me and my family, overshadowed the fear.""What are three words that your family and close friends would use to describe you?""Trustworthy, compassionate and genuine.""What animal would you say matches your personality best?""I'm going to go with a penguin because penguins have a strong sense of community, are kind, helpful and very loyal. Besides, I think they are adorable!""What's your favorite quote and why?""There are a lot of great ones out there but hands down this one from Maya Angelou has stuck with me for decades: ‘I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will NEVER forget how you made them feel.' This holds true in every aspect of my life - be that at home or work. I'm always aware of the impact your words and your actions have on others.""What's the best piece of advice someone has given you?""Take care of yourself first. You can't take care of anyone else until you focus on you.""What do you tend to do on the weekends?""I love to spend time with my family, especially my new granddaughter! My husband and I enjoy movies, trying new restaurants, catching a theatrical performance or, from August to January, taking in college football - Go Big Red!""If you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be and why?""My grandparents - all of them. Each of them taught me something special about life and helped sculpt who I am. I was fortunate to have them all with me into my 40s and I would give anything to be able to have more conversations with them.""What is one unique thing about yourself that most people don't know?""My grandpa was a Shriner clown - and I spent a lot of time at the circus as a child. I participated in parades, got to ride elephants and camels, and dressed up in fun costumes. Unfortunately, I did not pick up any ‘circus skills' along the way.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum! Brands on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Yum!

(NYSE:YUM). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Yum! Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands What's The Opportunity In Yum! Brands?Yum! Brands appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 31.63x is currently well-above the industry average of 19.56x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Yum! Brands’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Yum! Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Yum! Brands' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 47%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in YUM’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe YUM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on YUM for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for YUM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

BrandsYum! Brands, Wednesday, May 17, 2023, Press release pictureKFC has bold ambitions around inclusion. We believe our teams should reflect the same wonderful diversity as our customers around the world and every person should have the opportunity to thrive.This week, leaders from KFC across Pan-Europe gathered for a day-long workshop on equity, inclusion and belonging with an emphasis on how our commitment to inclusion intersects with KFC's social purpose of Feeding People's Potential.Throughout the room were franchise partners, General Managers, Chief People Officers (CPOs) and People &amp; Culture team members from our business units in Western Europe, Germany, France and Central Eastern Europe.Our journey to inclusion from the inside-outThe morning kicked off with our KFC Global Chief People Officer Cristi Lockett and Global Director of Inclusion and Capability Carolina Romero discussing KFC's EI&amp;B strategy and why it's critical to our business and our brand. Specifically, we celebrated the progress we've made in recent years on gender parity, as KFC has reached 52% parity across our teams globally. Looking beyond gender, each market shared their commitment to address additional dimensions of diversity to better reflect our customers and the communities in which we operate.Then, to further focus our discussion, Chief People and Transformation Officer for KFC Pan-Europe Nathalie Choudet shared context on the highly-diverse ethnic, origin and cultural landscape across the region along with KFC's biggest opportunities for impact.Sharing best practices brand-to-brandThe day continued with a panel led by Dr. Rohini Anand, Senior Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Advisor, and author of Leading Global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: A Guide for Systemic Change in Multinational Organizations. Through this discussion, HR and diversity leaders from global brands and non-profits including Loreal, Disneyland Paris, Ubisoft and Club 21 Siecle shared how they've strategized around diversity efforts and measuring progress, something that can often be challenging. As they shared their perspectives, there were many parallels with the motivations and values that also drive KFC's commitment to this space, as well as the perceived barriers that we're all tackling together.Story continuesWith new insights gained from the panel, participants spent time discussing the current landscape in their respective countries and new ways they can approach EI&amp;B through recruitment, development and culture.Opening doors to remarkable refugeesAfter lunch, we spent time discussing the importance of responsible hiring, specifically hiring refugees, with Helene Van Melle, Deputy Director of Tent Partnership for Refugees; Karolina Mastalerz, KFC HR Director at Amrest; and Emilia Stroe, CPO for US FOOD, Romania. These three leaders shared their experiences hiring refugees and value they bring to our restaurant teams and our brand. A key theme throughout this discussion was readiness. To be successful in this endeavor, the organization must be trained and prepared to welcome new refugee team members while we also need to prepare refugees for the role they'll play within the KFC family.Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder of Tent Partnership for Refugees and the CEO and founder of Chobani, summarizes the impact a stable work environment has on a refugee by saying, ""The moment a refugee gets a job, is the moment they stop being a refugee.""Continuing our journeyFinally, we wrapped the day by sharing market-specific action plans for how we can continue progress toward our EI&amp;B commitments through recruitment and retention strategies and social purpose programs.With partners like Tent Partnership for Refugees to help us reach and engage refugees at KFCs throughout Europe and beyond, we're hopeful on our mission to ensuring our teams are as diverse are our customers, and every KFC team member feels a true sense of belonging.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

329,c0b23e49-a1f5-35c0-a284-45e483fe1be0,MCD,2023-05-20,10 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-cheapest-fast-food-chains-061933509.html,1684563573,STORY,"['SBUX', 'MCD', 'WEN']","[In this article, we will look at the 10 cheapest fast-food chains right now. If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right Now.The magnitude of fast food consumption in the United States is substantial. Fast food plays a significant role in American spending habits, as consumers allocate a massive portion of their budgets to these establishments. Billpin reports that Americans contribute over $275 billion to the global fast-food industry, representing 18% of total expenditure. On an individual level, the average American spends approximately $1,200 annually on fast food. Collectively, the total expenditure on fast food in 2021 exceeded $200 billion. When considering a lifetime, the cumulative spending on fast food accumulates to around $70,000.The popularity of fast food is evident, with an estimated 50 million Americans consuming it daily. The global fast food market is valued at $931.7 billion. Notably, 80% of Americans visit a fast-food restaurant monthly, while 20% indulge weekly, and 23% of US adults consume it three or more times a week. Disturbingly, 34% of children aged 2 to 19 consume fast food daily.Factors Influencing Fast Food PricingConsidering the vast fast food consumption in the United States, it becomes essential to understand the factors that influence fast food pricing. These factors shape the cost structure and profitability of fast-food chains and provide insights into the pricing decisions made by these establishments. Here are several key factors that affect fast food pricing:Ingredient Sourcing and Cost: The cost of ingredients influences pricing, and fast food chains prioritize affordable and readily available options.Economies of Scale and Supply Chain Efficiency: Large chains negotiate bulk deals, optimize supply chains, and centralize purchasing to reduce costs.Operational Optimization and Cost Reduction: Streamlined processes, technology integration, and labor management help lower expenses.Rent and Location: High rent and prime locations can increase operating costs and impact pricing.Marketing and Branding: Investments in advertising and promotions play a significant role in shaping overall costs and influencing pricing decisions.Competition: Intense competition leads to price wars and promotional offers to attract customers.Menu Development and Complexity: Menu variety and complex recipes may increase production costs and affect pricing.Seasonal Factors: Specific menu items are impacted by ingredient cost fluctuations, which can be attributed to seasonality or changes in commodity prices.Regulatory Compliance and Costs: The adherence to regulations incurs additional expenses that directly impact pricing decisions.Overhead Expenses: Employee wages, utilities, equipment maintenance, and administrative costs contribute to pricing considerations.Story continuesBy considering these factors, fast food chains can balance customer affordability and maintain profitability. It's important to note that the relative importance of these factors may vary depending on the specific chain, location, and market conditions.Assessing Affordability: Beyond Menu PricesWhen evaluating the affordability of fast food chains, it's essential to consider food prices, menu options, and the overall value offered. While some chains may have lower base costs, they might compensate by offering smaller portion sizes or fewer menu options. On the other hand, higher-priced chains may provide more generous portions or include additional items in their meals, making them a better value proposition.Over the past two decades, fast-food prices have seen a significant shift. As reported by GoBankingRates, in 2002, a Big Mac from McDonald's cost a reasonable $2.39, but today, the price has surged by nearly 50%, approaching the $5 mark. It's essential to remember that this price only includes the burger, excluding the accompanying fries and beverages.Similarly, the price of a Grilled Steak Taco at Taco Bell was $1.49 in 2002. However, if you were to order the same taco now, it would cost an additional $1. On the other hand, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) and Chick-fil-A caused a buzz in 2022 as their meal prices significantly increased, capturing the attention of fast-food enthusiasts, as reported by CNET. Chick-fil-A saw a substantial surge of 15.6%, resulting in an average meal cost of $4.65. In contrast, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) took it a step further, with prices skyrocketing by 35% compared to 2021. These price adjustments by Chick-fil-A and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) made waves and sparked discussions among consumers and industry observers alike.According to the USDA, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for restaurant purchases showed a 0.6 percent increase in March 2023 compared to February 2023. Additionally, when compared to March 2022, the CPI was 8.8 percent higher. According to projections, food prices are expected to continue rising in 2023, though at a slower pace compared to the previous year. The expected overall increase for all food prices in 2023 is 6.5 percent, falling within a prediction interval of 4.9 to 8.2 percent. These figures indicate that food prices are still expected to grow at rates higher than the historical average.10 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right NowCopyright: bhofack2 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology To determine the 10 cheapest fast-food chains right now, we followed a rigorous methodology.

330,6f955245-59b8-3fd0-b3ae-98251b12db0c,MCD,2023-05-20,Chipotle (CMG) Shares Up 51% YTD: More Room for Upside?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipotle-cmg-shares-51-ytd-153803495.html,1684510683,STORY,"['CMG', 'MCD', 'SHAK']","[Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG is poised to benefit from robust comps growth, digital initiatives and Chipotlane add-ons. Also, solid recovery of in-restaurant sales and the positive customer reception to new menu items has been an important factor for sales improvement over the last few quarters.So far this year, shares of Chipotle have gained 51% compared with the industry’s 13.8% growth. The price performance was backed by a solid earnings surprise history. Chipotle’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 have moved up 5.7% and 4%, respectively, in the past 60 days. This positive trend signifies bullish analysts’ sentiments and justifies the company’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates robust fundamentals and an expectation of outperformance in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Major Growth DriversChipotle continues to impress investors with robust comparable sales growth. During the first quarter, comparable restaurant sales increased 10.9% year over year, following growth of 5.6% (in fourth-quarter 2022), 7.6% (in third-quarter 2022), 10.1% (in second-quarter 2022) and 9% (in first-quarter 2022). The upside can be attributed to rise in menu prices and higher transactions. This and consistent strength in digital sales, solid recovery of in-restaurant sales and the positive customer reception to new menu items contributed to the company’s results. For second-quarter and full-year 2023, the company expects comps growth in the mid to high-single-digit range.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChipotle is leaving no stone unturned to make digital ordering more appealing to customers and increasingly efficient for restaurants. The company redesigned and simplified the online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering and collaborated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery. In order to boost convenience in the digital ordering platform, the company initiated features such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. Another initiative that has been benefiting the company is the rewards program.Story continuesThe company is also focused on robotics-based autonomous vehicles for delivery, which is likely to enhance the customer experience in the upcoming periods. Digital sales contributed 39% to sales during first-quarter 2023. The company witnessed a rise in order-ahead transactions, courtesy of enhanced guest access and convenience.Chipotle continues to focus on the addition of Chipotlanes to drive growth.  During the first quarter of 2023, Chipotle opened 41 new restaurants, with 34 locations, including a Chipotlane. The addition enhanced customer access and convenience and bolstered new store restaurant sales, margins and returns Backed by impressive unit economics and the success of small-town locations, it anticipates opening between 255 and 285 restaurants in 2023, with more than 80% of the restaurants having Chipotlanes in them.Chipotle is consistently focusing on menu innovation to drive growth. During the first quarter of 2023, the company announced the addition of Fajitas to its Quesadilla platform (as a permanent menu item) and reported a solid business with respect to the same. The addition was supported by the limited complexity in its restaurant operations. The company announced the global roll out of Chicken Al Pastor in the United States, Canada and Europe and reported solid customer feedback.

332,d5885535-bb58-3184-afaf-a2e154c1681c,MCD,2023-05-20,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Mastercard, McDonald's and Starbucks",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-115011978.html,1684497011,STORY,"['MA', 'SBUX', 'MCD', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – May 19, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Mastercard Inc. MA, McDonald's MCD and Starbucks' SBUX2 Mega-Cap Stocks to Buy Now and Hold ForeverThe S&amp;P 500 has climbed over 9% in 2023 and is up 7% in the past 12 months even in the face of inflation, falling earnings, a slowing economy, global geopolitical unrest, and most recently, debt-ceiling fears. It is also worth remembering that the benchmark still trades nearly 15% below its peaks, so total euphoria is far from back.The performance over the last year, which includes short-term peaks and valleys, highlights why investors with horizons of many years or even many decades are wise to stay invested and avoid too much market timing.Instead, most investors are best served buying strong, proven companies in good and bad times if they have faith in the health and stability of the U.S. economy and stock market over the long haul.If you believe in the global economic system and financial markets it is difficult to imagine that current index levels and stock prices won't look ""cheap"" five, 10, or 20 years from now—almost no matter what happens in the near term. Plus, missing the market's best days (which often occur within a few weeks of the worst days) is proven to negatively impact your returns in a very meaningful way.The bears keep waiting for the earnings outlook to turn far worse than it already has over the last year. If the wider S&amp;P 500 earnings outlook holds steady through the summer, the bulls might be proven right in saying the worst is over (the current Q2 period) when it comes to corporate profits.Meanwhile, inflation is coming down and Wall Street is betting that Jay Powell and the Fed are essentially done raising rates. Many expect the Fed to start to lower rates by the end of 2023 or early 2024.Others might be focused on all the negativity and scary headlines around the debt ceiling. But a debt-ceiling deal will almost certainly get done because the alternative could cause unimaginable damage to the economy. Biden and McCarthy echoed this sentiment recently.Story continuesHere are two mega-cap stocks from different sectors of the economy that investors might want to buy in the back half of May and hold for years and years to come.Mastercard Inc.Mastercard is a credit card powerhouse that operates an elaborate backend processing and payment network around the U.S. and globally. Mastercard essentially grabs a small percentage of the never-ending amount of credit card swipes, taps, and more that pass through its insanely complex global payment network.MA is poised to grow as the world becomes increasingly cashless. Mastercard is also actively diversifying to evolve and fight back against a wave of young and hungry fintech upstarts.Mastercard's newer efforts include the likes of cryptocurrency, buy now pay later, and other potential growth segments. MA's core credit card space remains insanely consistent and its travel-focused cross-border unit is booming again. MA currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but it topped our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates in late April, with its FY23 and FY24 earnings estimates up since then on the back of resilient consumer spending.Zacks estimates call for Mastercard's revenue to jump 13% in 2023 and over 12% higher next year to reach $28.27 billion, which would follow 18% sales growth in 2022 and 23% expansion in FY21. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge 15% this year and another 17% next year to extend a long history of impressive bottom line growth, fueled by Mastercard's high-margin business.Mastercard stock has climbed nearly 40% off its October 2022 lows, including an 11% run in 2023. MA is still trading around where it was in the summer of 2021, having moved mostly sideways over the past two years.Yet, Mastercard might be ready to break out, with it back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Plus, it completed the golden cross, where the short-term moving average climbs back above the long-term trend, at the end of 2022.MA shares touched fresh 52-week highs on Thursday. Yet, Mastercard is trading at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings to put it near its own decade-long median and at a 35% discount to its own 10-year highs. Mastercard is also trading about 9% below its average Zacks price target. And 20 of the 24 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Mastercard are ""Strong Buys"" next to three ""Buys"" and one ""Hold.""Mastercard shares have skyrocketed over 1,110% in the past 15 years to edge out Microsoft and leave the S&amp;P 500's 200% climb and the Zacks Tech Sector's 250% run in the dust. Despite all of the established fintech firms and upstarts trying to edge out Mastercard, the credit card powerhouse remains a growth machine and deeply entrenched in the economic and financial system.McDonald'sThe McDonald's brand consistently ranks in the top 10 globally alongside the likes of Apple, Disney, Nike, and others. McDonald's hasn't lost a step with older generations, while catering to younger people by rolling out digital point-of-sale kiosks, adding new on-trend menu items, and going all in on mobile ordering and delivery.In fact, the McDonald's app was downloaded 127 million times worldwide in 2022, according to Apptopia to blow away Uber Eats' 60 million, DoorDash's 42 million, and Starbucks' 34 million.McDonald's posted 10.9% global comparable sales growth in 2022, which came on top of 17% YoY expansion in the key metric in 2021. MCD's adjusted earnings climbed roughly 9% and 50%, respectively during this same stretch. The firm raised its 2023 guidance in late April on the back of higher prices and positive traffic growth, with its upbeat earnings revisions helping it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks estimates call for MCD's adjusted earnings to climb by 9% in 2023 and another 10% in FY24 on the back of 8% and 7%, respective revenue growth. Some of McDonald's bottom-line expansion can be attributed to its corporate restructuring efforts and other initiatives aimed at streamlining operations.McDonald's is a Dividend Aristocrat that's paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. MCD is up 28% in the last year and is trading well above its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.The stock has more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, while destroying Disney, Coca-Cola, Walmart and other giants of various industries. MCD's stock price sits near all-time highs, but it trades at a 15% discount to its own 10-year highs at 25.7X forward earnings.There are over 40,000 McDonald's locations across over 100 countries, with roughly 95% owned by franchisees. McDonald's customers know what they are getting when they eat at the fast-food titan, which is something Wall Street loves. And MCD shares have already cooled off substantially in recent weeks, falling back to neutral RSI levels vs. highly overbought in late April.  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Vacancies will rise in 2023 as the existing construction pipeline is spoken for, according to the report. However, the cutback in starts will impact supply greatly, leading to another downtick in vacancies and uptick in rates during 2024, said the report, published Thursday.“The current environment has impacted construction development more than demand thus far,” the report stated. “As a result, it’s imperative to think ahead, particularly in the most sought after markets where vacancies will remain lower with new supply forecasted to drop off heading into 2024.”Competition for space continued in 2023, even as demand has returned to more normal levels, according to the report.

(NYSE:RHI) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-robert-half-134928940.html,1684504168,STORY,['RHI'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Robert Half International's shares before the 24th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.92 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Robert Half International has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $68.58. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Robert Half International Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Robert Half International paid out a comfortable 31% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 31% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Robert Half International's earnings per share have been growing at 20% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Robert Half International has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Robert Half International for the upcoming dividend? We love that Robert Half International is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.While it's tempting to invest in Robert Half International for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Robert Half International you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Freight brokerage firm Coyote Logistics, a wholly owned subsidiary of UPS (NYSE: UPS), told employees on Friday it is conducting a second round of layoffs this year, signaling continued pressure in the freight market.The number of people and locations of those affected were not disclosed, although sources said employees at multiple offices were notified of cuts.In a memo sent to affected staffers Friday and acquired by FreightWaves, Coyote’s human resources department attributed the cuts to months of truckload rate deflation, adding: “To maintain our business health and performance, we must make strategic decisions that position us for long-term success. This includes optimizing our organizational structures and workforce, which brought us to this difficult decision.”It’s the second time this year the Chicago-based company, which operates in 16 offices worldwide, has laid off employees. In February, the company reportedly cut 200 workers. And in 2020, the company laid off 55 people — 30 IT workers at its Chicago headquarters and 25 carrier representatives at its Chattanooga office.In 2015, UPS acquired Coyote for $1.8 billion. Since then, Coyote has doubled in size, with estimated 2022 revenue of $3.8 billion. Coyote’s revenue story hasn’t always been up and to the right, though: 2022 revenue was markedly lower than 2021’s $4.7 billion.In the past several years, UPS corporate management has made a series of changes to the brokerage, including reducing incentive-based compensation, removing carrier reps’ visibility into their margins per load and aggressively enforcing noncompete clauses — even against non-revenue-generating employees like carrier reps — in an attempt to reduce churn and control costs.The layoffs at Coyote come at a time of widespread reductions in head count across the transportation and logistics industry.This week, autonomous trucking software developer TuSimple announced it would cut 300 jobs, or 30% of its global workforce, just five months after cutting 350 jobs in December. Last week, broker C.H. Robinson Worldwide laid off 2% of its staff, or 300 people; the company also had a round of layoffs in November, cutting 650 positions. U.S. Xpress recently cut 150 jobs as its earnings report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed a significantly widened loss for the truckload carrier. That news came on the heels of the announcement that the company is being acquired by Knight-Swift (NYSE: KNX).Read more: What’s behind the never-ending freight brokerage layoffsThe post Coyote Logistics announces more layoffs appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

In fact, Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in the bank is still worth around $28 billion. Bank of America’s credit quality is a promising factor, with a drop in the non-performing loans ratio and an increase in the net charge-off ratio in Q4. While it’s crucial to monitor these metrics in the upcoming quarters of 2023, the bank’s diversified loan mix has helped mitigate overall credit risk. Furthermore, the stock’s low forward price-earnings ratio of 8.03 and steady dividend yield of 3.1% (backed by a payout ratio of only 27.1%) make it a potentially valuable asset. Analysts anticipate the bank to weather 2023 well and experience growth in 2024 or later as the economy improves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Express (AXP)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is recognized for offering credit cards aimed at wealthier clients who tend to be less impacted by economic recessions. Consequently, the company may perform better in a challenging environment such as this year. American Express’s primary approach centers on gaining more customers and expanding its base. In 2022, the company secured 12.5 million new card accounts. Investors can anticipate a 15-17% rise in companywide EPS in 2023. The corporation intends to raise its payout rate by 15% as compensation for its excellent performance.

However, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) conduct has spoken volumes. Occidental Petroleum is a worthwhile addition to the list of oil and gas stocks to purchase and appears to be a preferred stock choice for Warren Buffett. It has an attractive valuation with a 1.18% dividend yield and a potential for robust dividend growth in the foreseeable future.Occidental Petroleum focused on enhancing its credit indicators throughout the past year and paid off over $10.5 billion of debt, or 37% of the overall unpaid amount. The business is anticipated to continue to generate robust revenue and concentrate on debt reduction in order to quickly reach an investment-grade financial position. This could lead to increased shareholder rewards.Occidental Petroleum ended 2022 with 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves, indicating a strong reserve base.

SKX as the Bull of the Day and The Mosaic Company MOS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, HP Inc. HPQ and NetApp NTAP.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Skechers U.S.A., Inc. continues to give customers what they want: great shoes. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) had record first quarter sales.Skechers designs, develops and markets lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. Its collections are available in 180 countries and territories through department and specialty stores, online, and at over 4,500 company, and third-party-owned, physical retail stores.Big Beat in the First QuarterOn Apr 27, 2023, Skechers reported its first quarter 2023 results and crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.41. It reported earnings of $1.02 versus the consensus of $0.61.It was the third beat in the last four quarters.Quarterly sales were a record, up 10% to $2 billion from $1.81 billion last year. Skechers saw broad strength in most markets globally, including regional sales improvements of 21% in both EMEA and APAC, which includes 3% growth in China.Direct-to-Consumer increased 24.5% worldwide due to improved inventory availability in stores and strong demand for its new comfort product offering.Gross margins expanded by 360 basis points to 48.9% from 45.3% last year.Inventory, which has been the bane of many retailers, fell 17.4%, or $315.8 million, to $1.5 billion from Dec 31, 2022. Inventory levels decreased in AMER, EMEA and APAC.Analysts Raise Full Year EstimatesSkechers gave 2023 earnings guidance of between $3.00 to $3.20.The analysts had been too conservative. Business is hotter than they thought. 8 estimates for 2023 have been revised higher in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus has jumped to $3.14 from $2.93, which is in the higher end of the company's guidance range.Story continuesThis is earnings growth of 31.9% over last year as the company made just $2.38.The analysts are also bullish about 2024, with 7 estimates revised higher for next year too in the last month. The 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $3.78 from $3.63. That's another 20.3% growth.Shares at 5-Year HighsIt's been a wild ride for Skechers shares. They performed well during the pandemic and hit new highs in summer of 2021 before selling off the next 12 months.But in the last year, the shares are up 41.3% and are back to those 2021 5-year highs.It's still attractively valued, with a forward P/E of 17.1.Skechers doesn't pay a dividend, but it does have a share repurchase program. During the first quarter Skechers repurchased $30 million in shares. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had approximately $395.7 million remaining in the program.If you're looking for a global retailer that has growth and is still a value, Skechers should be on your short list.Bear of the Day:The Mosaic Company is expected to see earnings decline this year after the Ukraine War spiked fertilizer prices last year. But this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is still bullish on fertilizer demand in 2023.The Mosaic Company, headquartered in Tampa, FL, is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. It supplies phosphates and potash fertilizers and feed ingredients for the global agriculture industry.Another Earnings Miss in Q1On May 3, Mosaic reported its first quarter 2023 earnings and it reported earnings of $1.14 which was a miss of 10.9%, or $0.14. The Zacks Consensus was looking for $1.28.It was the fifth earnings miss in a row.Revenue fell 8% to $3.6 billion reflecting the impact of lower prices which were somewhat offset by higher volumes.In its three big categories, volumes were higher in 2023 than in 2022. In Potash, sales volume million tonnes was 1.9 compared to 1.8 last year. In Phosphate, sales volume million tonnes was 1.8 compared to 1.7 last year and in Mosaic Fertilizantes sales volume million tonnes was 2.1 compared to 1.8.But it was the opposite in sales price.Potash MOP Selling Price fell to $421 from $582 last year. Phosphate DAP Selling Price fell to $660 from $785. Mosaic Fertilizantes finished product selling price was $646, down from $817.Gross margins fell to 18.6% from 36.7% last year.Earnings Estimates SlashedThe analysts have been aggressively cutting their earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 the last 3 months as fertilizer prices have softened.For 2023, 4 have cut the last 30 days and 1 in just the last week. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has plunged to $5.05 from $8.45 in just the last 3 months.That's an earnings decline of 54% from 2022, when it made $11.01.The cuts extend into 2024 as well. 5 estimates were cut in the last month for 2024 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.02 from $5.48 just 3 months before.That's another 20.4% drop.Mosaic Optimistic About DemandTo counter all that analyst bearishness, which is the reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is the company's industry outlook.It expects the grain and oilseed markets to remain tight through 2023 and beyond. Mosaic said in North America, sentiment has improved ""significantly"" compared to the second half of 2022.Mosaic also said spring nutrient application rates were trending toward normal levels. And for both potash and phosphates, supply constraints remain.Shares Down BigBut until earnings turn around and get raised, instead of cut, investors have decided to flee the stock. Year-to-date, shares are down 18.4%, but over the last year shares have fallen 45.5%.It's dirt cheap, even with the earnings cuts. It's trading with a forward P/E of just 7.Mosaic is also generating plenty of free cash flow. Mosaic is standing by its 2023 Capital Allocation Strategy, which is to return largely all of the 2023 free cash flow back to shareholders.In the first quarter, that meant $608 million was returned through share repurchases and dividends. It's dividend is currently yielding 2.3%.Fertilizers are a commodity. It's a challenging industry in which to invest. For investors interested in the fertilizers, and Mosaic, you may want to wait until the Zacks Rank moves higher. Keep Mosaic on your watch list.Additional content:Is NVIDIA (NVDA) Likely to Beat Q1 Earnings?NVIDIA Corp. is likely to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 24.For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues of $6.5 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.51 billion, indicating a 21.5% decline from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 92 cents per share. This suggests a year-over-year decline of 32.4%.The company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -3.2%.Let's see how things have shaped up before the announcement.Factors to ConsiderNVIDIA's first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market's last quarter results had shown early signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% sequentially in the last reported quarter. NVIDIA's Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 13% sequentially. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter for both end markets.Moreover, the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA's first-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company's Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in five of the last seven quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and artificial intelligence cockpit solutions.However, we opine that ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, like high inflation and interest rates, are likely to have continued to hurt the sales of NVIDIA's desktop workstation GPUs in the first quarter. Additionally, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented across several parts of China might have weighed on the overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVDA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate (94 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (92 cents per share), is +2.43%.

The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.29% at present. HP's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 1.1%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ's second-quarter earnings is pegged at 76 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 29.6% from the year-ago quarter's earnings of $1.11.

341,4552a4c7-eeae-3f5f-9e6a-3f1ef33511fc,ZBH,2023-05-20,Here's Why You Should Retain QIAGEN (QGEN) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-qiagen-qgen-120512004.html,1684497912,STORY,"['QGEN', 'HOLX', 'ZBH']","[QIAGEN N.V. QGEN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the solid execution of its Five Pillars of Growth strategy and advancements made in the portfolio. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results reflected impressive growth across Non-COVID-19 product groups, which buoys optimism. However, escalating expenses and  decreased COVID-19 sales do not bode well for QIAGEN.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 0.8% compared with the 6.9% rise of the industry and a 6.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Performance: QIAGEN ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings, while revenues were almost in line with estimates. The company delivered high organic revenues exceeding its outlook of approximately $490 million, led by the strength of the non-COVID-19 base business.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe quarter’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 52 cents at the constant exchange rate (CER). The metric surpassed the previously announced guidance of 47 cents at CER.Across product groups, Sample Technologies (comprising one-third of total sales) outperformed in the first quarter, with robust growth in non-COVID-19 applications and gains from instrument sales. QGEN continues to invest in key portfolio areas, including QIAcuity digital PCR, the syndromic system — QIAstat-Dx — and the integrated PCR testing system NeuMoDx.The Five Pillars of Growth Strategy Drives Sales: Amid the uncertain macro environment, significant investments made in the Five Pillars of Growth strategy have contributed to high organic revenues across non-COVID-19 product groups.Within the Diagnostic solutions product group, the QuantiFERON latent TB test was the main driver, with sales rising 19% at CER on growth in all regions. QIAGEN’s digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clinical testing system — QIAstat Diagnostics and NeuMoDx —  progressed well in transitioning to non-COVID utilizations.Story continuesThe QIAcuity portfolio of the PCR system and application kit generated impressive organic sales. This was driven by solid instrument placement and the increasing uptake of consumables across regions. The Sample Technologies group sustained its rising growth trend in the first quarter, supported by solid CER gains in consumables and instrument sales.Portfolio Advancements to Benefit: Throughout the first quarter, QIAGEN made significant progress in its Sample to Insight portfolio. The launch of the QIAstat-Dx syndromic testing platform in Japan expands the list of countries where the instruments are currently used for the diagnostics of various diseases. On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call, QGEN had indicated developing new applications for blood infections, pneumonia and complex urinary tract infection panels.Meanwhile, QIAGEN added the global pharmaceutical group, Servier, as a new partner to its companion diagnostics co-development program. The collaboration is set to develop companion diagnostic for TIBSOVO as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.Within Genomics/NGS, QIAGEN Digital Insights launched an NGS analysis solution that can process a whole genome sequence in about 25 minutes. The enhanced CLC Genomics Workbench Premium product removes data analysis bottlenecks as seen in NGS. This accelerates the analysis and interpretation of whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.DownsidesMounting Expenses Put Pressure: QIAGEN reported a contraction in the adjusted gross margin in the first quarter of 2023. The adjusted operating income (excluding items like acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring and integration and others) declined 47.5% year over year to $121.2 million in the first quarter. Higher R&amp;D costs in the quarter represented 11.3% of sales made toward investments in the Five Pillars of Growth strategy for new products, test menus and applications.COVID-19 Product Sales Decline: Headwinds related to the sales of the COVID-19 product group resulted in QIAGEN’s first-quarter top line declining 20% at CER. For 2023, the company expects a significant drop in the group’s sales.Estimate TrendQIAGEN has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has gone up from $2.10 to $2.12.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.05 billion, suggesting a decrease of 4.2% from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

MYGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by robust volume growth across product categories and new strategic partnerships. Strength in the company’s commercial infrastructure resulting from improvements made in the last few years buoys optimism. However, escalating expenses do not bode well for Myriad Genetics.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 12.9% compared with the 5.5% fall of the industry and a 5.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned genetic testing and precision medicine company has a market capitalization of $1.52 billion. Myriad Genetics projects estimated earnings growth of 71.9% for the next year, compared with 9.3% of the industry and 19.2% of the S&amp;P 500 composite. MYGN’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 65.13%.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpsidesProduct Volume Growth Contributes: Myriad Genetics attributes the year-over-year increase in first-quarter 2023 revenues to strong growth in product testing volumes.Within the Oncology business, Hereditary cancer testing volumes reported impressive double-digit growth. MYGN’s leading prostate cancer test Prolaris was another highlight of the first quarter, reporting volume growth of 22% from the prior-year quarter. The company’s Mental Health business witnessed a record number of GeneSight tests in the first quarter, with nearly 4,000 clinicians ordering the test for the first time.Excluding contributions from the Gateway Genomics acquisition, prenatal testing volumes grew 12% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The quarterly figure includes minimal contributions from California due to ongoing disruptions caused by the state's revised prenatal screening program.New Partnerships Appear Promising: Myriad Genetics announced several new strategic partnerships in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesIn March, the company expanded its partnership with Illumina to increase the access and availability of oncology homologous recombination deficiency testing in the United States.Last month, Myriad Genetics announced a collaboration with SimonMed Imaging — one of the largest independent outpatient imaging providers in the United States. The program is expected to enable affordable access to genetic testing and deliver personalized insights to better inform clinical decisions for millions of potential patients.On the first-quarter earnings call, MYGN mentioned that it has entered into a partnership with ClinVar at the request of the company’s providers.Strength in Commercial Capabilities: Throughout last year, Myriad Genetics made good progress in its commercial execution, resulting in robust volume growth in the last two quarters. The company credits its skilled and experienced sales force as the key drivers of commercial performance.MYGN enhanced its Oncology commercial team by adding experienced leadership, which provided improved operational efficiencies. These include a significant reduction in turnaround times for oncology tests compared to the previous year’s quarter, a Net Promoter Score of 73% amongst oncology providers and a fully equipped sales force. Per MYGN, continued commercial execution and top-tier talent will fuel its long-term growth even further.DownsideMounting Expenses Put Pressure: Myriad Genetics reported a contraction in the gross margin and an operating loss in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter’s adjusted operating expenses reflected investments in sales and marketing programs, technology, research and development, additional operating expenses from Gateway Genomics and inflationary pressures.Estimate TrendMyriad Genetics has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

CRL is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by strategic acquisitions and the robust performance of the Discovery and Safety Assessment (“DSA”) segment. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results instill investors’ optimism. However, the nonhuman primate (NHP) supply situation and foreign exchange headwinds do not bode well for the Charles River.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 16.4% compared with the 19.1% fall of the industry and a 5.6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.Operating as a full-service, early-stage contract research organization, Charles River has a market capitalization of $9.84 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 5.33% compared with the industry’s 1.99%. CRL surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 5.39%.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpsidesImpressive Q1 Performance: Charles River exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Revenues improved 12.6% year over year, while organic revenues grew 15.4%. This was driven by the robust DSA performance and solid RMS growth.Based on the strong first-quarter performance, Charles River narrowed its 2023 guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share.Strategic Acquisitions Drive Growth: Charles River broadens the scope of products and services across the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum through focused acquisitions.The acquisition of Cognate in March 2021 is highly complementary to the company’s Biologics business. The buyout established Charles River as a premier scientific partner in cell and gene therapy development, testing and manufacturing.Within RMS, the company acquired Explora Biolabs in April 2022. San Diego-based Explora has a similar focus like Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab. It is currently operating more than 15 preclinical vivarium facilities with a greater presence on the West Coast.Story continuesDSA Arm Continues to Thrive: The segment reported a 23.6% organic revenue rise in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by broad-based growth in the Safety Assessment business on favorable base pricing, with NHP pass-throughs and higher study volumes.DownsidesNHP Supply Issue: On Feb 17, Charles River received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice over an investigation into the supply of NHPs from Cambodia, which are part of the animal research services the company offers to drug developers.Compelled by the heightened focus and ongoing investigations, the company decided to voluntarily suspend its planned future shipments of Cambodian NHPs. This will continue until the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can develop and implement new procedures to reinforce confidence that NHPs it imports from Cambodia are purpose-bred. This will take time to implement, and the duration of which is unknown.Foreign Exchange Translation Affects Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for CRL due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies has been constantly hampering the company’s performance in international markets. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported revenue growth by 2.1% in the first quarter.Estimate TrendCharles River has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 9.9% up to $10.25 in the past seven days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.10 billion, suggesting a 3.1% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

TechnipFMC will provide production enhancement, production data, and pre-plug-and-abandonment services to Equinor using the RLWI method.RLWI enables well interventions from a monohull vessel, eliminating the need for a riser and the rig required to connect the riser to the subsea well. Instead, remotely operated Well Control Systems are used to facilitate operations on the seabed. This reduces cost and complexity, increases efficiency, and accelerates the timeframe for increased production.Jonathan Landes, President, Subsea at TechnipFMC, commented: ""TechnipFMC has been providing RLWI services to Equinor since 2006. Over that period, the average duration of an intervention has been reduced by nearly two-thirds thanks to improvements in process and technology, aided by the collaborative relationship with Equinor’s dedicated RLWI team. It is a pleasure to continue developing that relationship as we help our client meet demand for energy.""(1) For TechnipFMC, a ""significant"" contract is between $75 million and $250 million.

Hey, Remy.REMY BLAIRE: Good morning. Well, Wall Street has had yet another positive open this morning, and this does come on the heels of two straight sessions of gains. Given the advance that we saw in the major stock averages, the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 hit their highest levels for the close for this year. As for today's session, the latest earnings reports as well as Fed speak continue to be in the spotlight.Story continuesAs for market-moving stocks that we're watching here at the New York Stock Exchange, let's start out with a look at Occidental Petroleum. Now, shares of the company have advanced in New York morning trade, and this comes on the heels of news that Berkshire Hathaway has scooped up more stock of the energy company, purchasing approximately $200 million, raising its total stake to a whopping $12.7 billion. Now, Buffett's conglomerate controls over 20% of Occidental stock.Also, another stock that we're watching this morning on the heels of the latest earnings report out from retailers is Farfetch Limited. As of this morning at the open, we saw shares pop a whopping 20%. And this means that the company's stock has come off recent lows.The luxury online retailer reported first quarter revenue that was up 8% year-on-year, and its bottom line fell less than forecasts as consumers kept shopping, at least with the luxury retailer. Now, boosting numbers for the company, they did see an improvement in inventory in the latest quarter as well as successful brand partnerships and stronger in-store sales contributing to that strong quarterly result.Now, it is possible that when it comes to discretionary spending, at least in the luxury space, consumers continue to spend. Very recently in terms of other earnings coming out from the luxury sector, we saw LVMH, Moet Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, and Richemont report Q1 performance that did top expectations.

Remember, the 13-Fs are released 45 days after the end of the quarter. They provide the stock purchases, and sales, of the big portfolio managers.Many managers toil away in relative obscurity, known only by their own investors. But that is not the case with the most famous value manager, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett.This quarter’s 13-F was released on May 15, after the market closed. Tracey went on Whale Wisdom, one of the popular 13-F websites, to see Berkshire’s filing, and it was so busy she couldn’t get on the page. It gave her an error message about too many users.But is it all this hype over nothing?One New BuyIt turns out, Berkshire didn’t do much with its money in Q1 in terms of buying equities. It still has $130 billion sitting there, ready to be deployed.1.       Capital One Financial (COF)Buffett added a new $1 billion position in Capital One Financial in Q1. It’s a financial company that is well known for its credit card business, but also offers auto loans, and personal and commercial banking. This is a small position for the overall portfolio.Shares of Capital One Financial are up 6.7% year-to-date but are down 13.3% over the last year. It’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.8.Capital One Financial pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.Did you know that Berkshire already owns two other major credit card companies?2.       Visa Corporation (V)How many know that Berkshire owns Visa? It first bought shares in the third quarter of 2011. That was good timing.Story continuesShares of Visa are up 963% since Aug 31, 2011. But the Visa position is still very small in the Berkshire portfolio. It’s just 0.58%.Why hasn’t Berkshire bought more over the years? Maybe valuation played a factor. Visa trades at 27x earnings.3.       Mastercard Inc. (MA)Did you know that Berkshire owns Mastercard as well? Berkshire bought it first, in the first quarter of 2011. It must have liked what it saw, and then bought Visa two quarters later.Mastercard is just 0.45% of the portfolio. That’s a very small position which won’t move the needle much, if at all.It’s too bad it’s so small because shares of Mastercard are up 1,479% since Feb 28, 2011. It’s been a great performer.Mastercard is even more expensive, on a P/E basis, than Visa. It’s trading at 31x. Valuation could also be the reason Buffett doesn’t add to the Mastercard position.A Surprising Sale in Q1There were several trims of various positions in Q1, including selling some of the Amazon position, but there was also one surprise sale: RH. It didn’t just trim it. It sold ALL of it. Berkshire Hathaway already owns several furniture companies. Did they just not want to own another?It was a small position in the portfolio, just 0.2%, so the shareholders won’t even notice. But it was still a surprise.4.       RH (RH)RH is a luxury lifestyle brand that sells furniture, offers interior design services and has hospitality offerings in hotels and restaurants. Berkshire first bought shares in the third quarter of 2019. It stayed committed throughout the pandemic, even on the initial stock panic.But shares of RH are down 56% the last 2 years. RH’s earnings are expected to fall 43% this year.RH also isn’t cheap. It trading with a forward P/E of 21.It will report earnings again on May 25, 2023.5.       Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM)No, Berkshire doesn’t own Williams-Sonoma, but maybe it should. It owns the top retail furniture brand in West Elm. It’s stock has also had a rough 2 years, falling 28%. But Williams-Sonoma is now cheap, with a forward P/E of 8.3. It’s earnings are also expected to fall, but only 18.8% from last year.Williams-Sonoma also pays a dividend, currently yielding 3.1%.What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About What Berkshire Is Buying and Selling?

359,60c78690-4074-3d4c-b6dc-d99a3659b6f6,ULTA,2023-05-20,Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-ulta-earnings-expected-140002192.html,1684418402,STORY,"['ULTA', 'DKS']","[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.62 billion, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?For Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ulta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $5.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.68, delivering a surprise of +17.40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ulta appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.21 per share for the quarter ended April 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.83 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Dick's has been revised 0.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.15%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Dick's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

360,d93fcb4a-163d-32fa-8395-9c32dd6e824c,ULTA,2023-05-20,Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-attracting-130001929.html,1684328401,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -7.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, to which Ulta belongs, has lost 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $6.81 per share, indicating a change of +8.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.26 points to a change of +5.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.22 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ulta.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.07 billion and $11.66 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $3.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.2%. EPS of $6.68 for the same period compares with $5.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +17.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Photo: Shutterstock/Michael Sheaffer)Norfolk Southern and one of the largest unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), have reached an agreement over sick leave.The two also have a second quality-of-life agreement that will need to be ratified by members. By ratifying that agreement, the sick leave deal will also be ratified.The sick leave agreement calls for five days of paid sick leave per year plus the opportunity to use two additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave, NS and BLET said late Thursday in a joint news release. The agreement will affect more than 3,300 NS (NYSE: NSC) employees, or almost 25% of the railroad’s craft workforce.With this latest development, about 98% of NS’ craft workforce has tentative or ratified sick leave agreements.The unions, including BLET, had sought to address work-life issues and press for sick leave during the national collective bargaining process that began in November 2019, according to the National Railway Labor Conference, the group representing the Class I railroads at the bargaining table. But when the negotiations hit a wall last year, the three-member Presidential Emergency Board appointed by President Joe Biden recommended that the work-life issues be resolved at the local level.“We are proud to be the first to have reached a paid sick leave agreement for our dedicated BLET membership,” Dewayne Dehart, BLET general chairman for NS’ northern lines GCA, said in the release. “This trailblazing new deal ensures that engineers finally have access to the time they need and deserve to manage their personal well-being.”Sick leave agreements between BLET and most other Class I railroads may still be at the negotiating table. While sick leave was a contentious issue during last year’s contract negotiations, sick leave agreements aren’t mandatory.“I want to thank General Chairmen Dehart, [Jerry] Sturdivant, and [Scott] Bunten, along with National Vice President Rick Gibbons, for their efforts in securing this historic agreement,” said BLET National President Eddie Hall. “The BLET is currently working to secure similar sick leave agreements with the other Class I railroads, and I hope this settlement will help bring those negotiations to a positive conclusion.”Story continuesThe second quality-of-life agreement includes language that bolsters the preservation of locomotive engineers’ earnings when they use sick leave, according to both parties, and the agreement offers a “greater protection for vacation time.”“I deeply appreciate the contributions of our Norfolk Southern engineers and the longstanding partnership we’ve had with the BLET,” NS President and CEO Alan Shaw said. “This agreement builds on that relationship and continues our industry-leading effort to enhance quality of life as we become the first railroad to reach an engineer sick leave deal.”Last month, NS and train conductors represented by the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) reached an agreement that not only includes sick leave but addresses scheduling, work-rule changes and meal reimbursements.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inboxClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Norfolk Southern, SMART-TD reach labor scheduling deal for conductorsSick leave, crew consists still on the table between unions, railroadsNS, SMART-TD to hold off on conductor redeployment talksNorfolk Southern eyes service improvements in back half of 2023The post Norfolk Southern reaches sick leave agreement with locomotive engineers appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The National Association of Realtors report showed that sales tumbled 23.2% compared to a year earlier, while the national median price of existing homes posted its biggest annual decline in over a decade.Other data releases included the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index that showed a decline for the 13th consecutive month in April, while weekly jobless claims fell to 242,00 in the week ended May 13.Earnings from retailers on Thursday showed a divergence from results earlier this week. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) shares ticked higher on strong sales in the recent quarter as the bellwether upped its full-year outlook.Bath &amp; Body Works (NYSE: BBWI) shrugged off negative expectations for an easing of discretionary spending among consumers as it launched innovative new products and special drops of limited-time items.

And to help us do that, let's get to Yahoo Finance contributor Remy Blaire. She's over at the New York Stock Exchange. Remy?REMY BLAIRE: Well, Wall Street has been trading on both sides of flat this morning after a mixed open. Keep in mind that this does come on the heels of yesterday's market rally, which saw the Dow, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500 all close higher by over 1%. In today's session, the NASDAQ continues to extend its gains and is up by about 1% as we head into the noon hour.Story continuesOf course, the latest economic data releases as well as earnings are being digested this morning. We got a mixed batch of economic data. We saw existing home sales decline in April while the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index fell for the 13th month in a row. The Philly Fed Index of Factory Activity also declined, and weekly jobless claims for the latest week fell as well. Of course, it's all about the implications of all this economic data in terms of the Fed's rate-hike trajectory.Now in terms of the latest earnings report, Bed-- Bath &amp; Body Works shares are surging this morning. Now, the maker of body care as well as fragrance products saw shares surge by 10%, and this came on the heels of the company reporting earnings and revenue that top forecasts. This did come in even though sales came in softer than expected. The maker of scented candles as well as hand sanitizers, body care products such as body lotion and body wash, did manage to raise its full year guidance.Now this week, we have been following the latest earnings out from retailers such as Target, as well as Home Depot, and we have been seeing a pullback in discretionary spending from those earnings reports. But looking at the calendar up ahead, we will be getting Lowe's results next week as well as Foot Locker at the end of this week, so we'll be getting more insight into the American consumer's spending habits.- Well, the focus has certainly been on the retailer this week.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Waste Management with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management How Fast Is Waste Management Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Waste Management managed to grow EPS by 12% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Waste Management maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.8% to US$20b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Waste Management's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Waste Management Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$68b company like Waste Management. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$133m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesDoes Waste Management Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Waste Management is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Waste Management.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Haleon PLC Sponsored ADR and Stryker are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that HLN's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HLN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.96, while SYK has a forward P/E of 27.95. We also note that HLN has a PEG ratio of 2.70. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. SYK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.97.Another notable valuation metric for HLN is its P/B ratio of 1.96. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SYK has a P/B of 6.38.These metrics, and several others, help HLN earn a Value grade of B, while SYK has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesHLN stands above SYK thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HLN is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ABT recently announced the receipt of the FDA approval for its Assert-IQTM insertable cardiac monitor (ICM), giving doctors a new choice for the diagnostic assessment and ongoing monitoring of patients with irregular heartbeats. This approval adds to Abbott's line-up of remote patient management and treatment tools that can support doctors more effectively.The latest approval bolster Abbott’s cardiac rhythm management business.More on Assert-IQAbbott's Assert-IQ ICM uses Bluetooth® technology to stay linked to a transmitter, typically the patient's own cell phone, where it continuously monitors heart rhythms and sends real-time results to the clinic's portal. Assert-IQ ICM models can also be remotely programmed, which enables doctors to change the associated device's settings, improve performance and reduce pointless warnings or transmissions — without needing the patient to come to the clinic.The Assert-IQ ICM increased diagnostic capabilities to give doctors more clinically applicable knowledge about the patient's cardiovascular health and facilitate quicker clinical decisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Assert-IQ helps doctors monitor for at least six years by providing a lengthy battery life. That is especially useful when providing care for patients who are receiving therapy, have recently undergone cardiac ablation or may be at risk of developing new arrhythmias, such as AFib.Benefits of Assert-IQWhen compared with other diagnostic techniques in the market for diagnosing abnormal cardiac rhythms, the Assert-IQ ICM marks a major improvement. Patients can go about their regular lives and engage in the activities they enjoy while the ICM performs its function. The device is tiny and implanted just beneath the skin. With the use of Assert-IQ ICM's sophisticated algorithms, doctors can choose a course of therapy for even difficult-to-find anomalies. It can be a very useful technique for managing cardiac arrhythmia diseases both temporarily and permanently.Story continuesMore physicians are using ICM technology to remotely monitor their patients to better identify the underlying causes of symptoms that may have an impact on general health and the quality of life as the prevalence of irregular cardiac rhythms like atrial fibrillation rises. The Assert-IQ test by Abbott ICM provides doctors with a linked health tool so they can give their patients the best care possible and make more accurate and knowledgeable treatment decisions.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global cardiac rhythm management devices market size was valued at USD 18.8 billion in 2022 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 5.50% by 2030.

374,9b9c06a3-cb4e-3a95-a07f-9d9224c8ffed,DVA,2023-05-20,What's in the Cards for Medtronic (MDT) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-medtronic-mdt-q4-150603060.html,1684508763,STORY,"['MDT', 'HOLX', 'DVA']","[Medtronic plc MDT is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.17%. Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 0.77%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMedtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally in the form of supply chain disruption, a severe shortage of health professional labor and a record level of inflationary pressure. This continued impact of inflation with increased freight expenses is expected to have affected the fourth-quarter performance.Considering how severe the impact of inflation of raw materials and freight has been on the company’s margin in the last quarter, Medtronic, on its fiscal third-quarter earnings call, stated that it expects continued gross margin pressure in the fourth quarter and the next year. The gross margin impact is expected to have translated into a decline in the company’s adjusted operating margin this time around. However, this might have been partially muted by expense control and the benefit of the company’s currency hedging program.In such a scenario, the company has prioritized its R&amp;D investments. This might get reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter results.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteAdded to this, severe currency headwinds are expected to have affected profitability further. In this regard, on the fiscal thrid-quarter earnings call, the company noted that the fourth quarter would experience a currency headwind between $165 million and $215 million on revenues.The company, meanwhile, has been driving significant expense reduction to help offset lower revenues and continued inflation impact. Amid the macro-environmental headwinds in the form of inflation, China VBP and softer procedure volumes in certain markets and currencies, the company claims to have been laser-focused on driving operational and expense efficiencies.Story continuesIn the to-be-reported quarter, Medtronic expects organic revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.0%, implying strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability based on new launches.The company’s Cardiovascular portfolio is expected to gain 5.5% to 6% organically in on the continued rollout of Evolut FX and LINQ II. In cardiac rhythm management, the pacing business is expected to have generated strong sales.In the neuroscience portfolio, the company's market share in Cranial and Spinal technologies is expected to have increased. Demand for the company’s new spine implants is expected to have contributed to the growth. Further, the ecosystem of Aible-enabling technology and the associated pull-through of the company’s best-in-class spinal implants is expected to have contributed to the fourth-quarter top line. The Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system, particularly, are expected to have performed strongly in the to-be-reported quarter.The company earlier expected its neuroscience revenues to grow in the range of 6.5% to 7% organically in the fourth quarter.In Medical Surgical and surgical robotics, Medtronic remains focused on the limited market release of the Hugo robot while it scales production. The company recently completed Hugo installations in several geographies like Denmark, France and Italy, which are likely to have added to the company’s top-line growth within this arm. However, according to Medtronic, given increased volume-based procurement in many Chinese provinces, medical-surgical revenues are expected to be down 2.5% to 3% in the fourth quarter.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States, where Medtronic is lacking in terms of latest products due to regulatory complications. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States on the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor. According to Medtronic, overall Diabetes is expected to decline in the low single digits on an organic basis in the quarter under review.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal fourth-quarter total revenues of $8.25 billion suggests a 1.9% rise from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.56 per share implies a 2.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Medtronic this time around.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Managed by Renaissance Technologies, the Medallion Fund stands as one of the world's most prosperous and enigmatic hedge funds. Established in 1988 by mathematician Jim Simons, the fund has consistently generated remarkable returns for its investors, earning a reputation for employing mathematical models and algorithms to conduct trading activities within the financial markets. With a current net worth of approximately $28 billion, Simons directs his attention beyond the daily trading of stocks and other financial assets. The unique approach employed by Simons and his former colleagues at Renaissance has yielded unprecedented annualized returns. During the March quarter, fund managers focused their attention on the U.S. financial sector, which experienced significant volatility as a result of the severe banking crisis, reminiscent of the 2008 financial meltdown. According to Reuters, securities filings released for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that Renaissance Technologies was one of the notable funds that invested in First Republic Bank. Renaissance Technologies acquired around 7.1 million shares of the bank during the first quarter and retained ownership of them until March 31, when they were valued at $13.99 per share.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies also significantly increased its investment in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) during the fourth quarter of 2022. Their holdings of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock grew by 18% to reach 4 million shares. The firm also acquired nearly 1.8 million shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), resulting in a stake worth $749,000 as of the end of March 2023. However, in this article, we discuss the top 15 stocks to buy and hold according to Jim Simons’ hedge fund, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Story continuesOur Methodology For this list, we selected top 15 stocks from the Q1 2023 13F portfolio of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesBillionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top Stock Picks15. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $485,381,000Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) offers a comprehensive communications platform across various regions, including the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Their service, Zoom Meetings, enables users to engage in high-definition video, voice, chat, and content sharing on a wide range of devices such as mobile devices, computers, telephones, and conference room systems. In Q1 2023, Simons’ fund owned 6.5 million shares of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) worth $6.5 million, representing 0.64% of the total 13F securities. According to Needham analyst Ryan Koontz, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is expected to benefit from Microsoft's reported decision to separate Teams from Office. On April 24, the analyst maintained a Hold rating on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), stating that Teams has become a prominent collaboration platform for enterprises. The unbundling of Teams from Office increases the analyst's confidence in Zoom's ability to achieve a consensus growth rate of 5% in its fiscal year 2025. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q4 2022, 36 funds were long Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $719 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is one of the top stock picks of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. Here is what Horos Asset Management had to say about Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”14. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,125,000The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) operates as a food and drug retailer in the United States. Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed that Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies owned more than 10 million shares of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) worth $495 million, representing 0.65% of the total portfolio. On March 20, Northcoast analyst Chuck Cerankosky raised the rating on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) from Neutral to Buy and set a price target of $60. The stock has declined to the mid-$40 range due to the company's announcement of its intention to acquire Albertsons. However, the analyst believes that since the transaction is still a considerable time away, investors should instead focus on the value of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) stock based on its own strengths. This was demonstrated in the company's recently released fourth-quarter results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 50 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Oakmark Fund made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,718,000Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global company engaged in the research, development, production, marketing, distribution, and sale of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. In Q1 2023, Jim Simons’ fund owned more than 12 million shares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) worth $495.7 million, representing 0.65% of the total 13F portfolio. Renaissance Technologies increased its stake in the company by 1034% in Q1. On April 26, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 9, to shareholders of record on May 12. Barclays analyst Carter Gould on May 3 maintained an Equal Weight rating on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $43 following the Q1 results. The analyst anticipates a difficult situation for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in the upcoming summer months, as the effects of COVID and new product launches are expected to have a greater impact in the later part of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared to 77 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 9.8 million shares worth $502.7 million. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”12. United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $498,852,000United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR) is a biotechnology company that focuses on developing and bringing to market innovative products to meet the medical needs of patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening diseases.

We don’t hold gold in client portfolios, we hold gold royalty companies. The two have surprisingly little in common. The gold royalty company generates very impressive profits even if the gold price never rises, and it earns those profits year after year. Here is a long-term chart of Franco Nevada Corp., the premier gold royalty company vs. gold itself: a comparable gold price today than a decade ago, yet Franco Nevada returned 12.5% annually, matching the S&amp;P 500 return, despite its nearsole source of revenues unchanged. What will Franco Nevada’s earnings and share price do if gold rises over the course of a decade?”10.

Current airframe production is running materially below expected travel demand over the next 5-10 years, creating a structural supply/demand imbalance that we believe will drive a decade of strong growth in civil aerospace from here.

The company’s stock price had fallen roughly 17% from its peak in October 2021 on fears about Medicare reimbursement rates, and we used this dislocation to start purchasing shares of what we believe to be the most dominant and complete managed care company in the industry.With several at-scale and interconnected businesses, UNH occupies a unique position within the U.S. healthcare system. UnitedHealth has (a) a dominant managed care organization in commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets, (b) a large and growing presence in local care delivery (OptumHealth’s physicians and ambulatory service centers), (c) one of only three at scale pharmacy benefits managers (OptumRx’s PBM) and (d) a fast-growing healthcare information technology (HCIT), consulting and revenue cycle management (RCM) business (OptumInsight). The combination of the largest MCO (UnitedHealth) with the faster-growing, higher-margin Optum services businesses positions the company to capture a large portion of the future growth opportunities in the U.S. healthcare services industry. We expect balanced growth from both health insurance and health services leading to consistent high-single-digit revenue growth for the company. With margin expansion from scale, share buybacks from its strong cash generating ability (the company currently has $30 billion in net cash), and continued strategic acquisitions, we believe the company can generate mid-teens or better earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UNH shares were down slightly from where we re-initiated a position during the quarter, causing them to be a top detractor (-0.02%) in an overall strong quarter where few positions were down.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Quantum Computing Companies in the World10 Least Digitized Industries That Are Ripe for Digital Transformation15 Best Countries for Americans to Live in Europe Disclosure: None.

Why VeriSign (VRSN) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004573.html,1684339204,STORY,['VRSN'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at VeriSign (VRSN), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. VeriSign currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if VRSN is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this internet infrastructure services provider holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor VRSN, shares are up 1.48% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry is up 1.04% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 2.98% compares favorably with the industry's 0.82% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of VeriSign have increased 10.1% over the past quarter, and have gained 33.2% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 0.82% and 4.2%, respectively.Investors should also take note of VRSN's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, VRSN is averaging 426,823 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with VRSN.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VRSN's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.74 to $6.92 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that VRSN is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep VeriSign on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

XYL is benefiting from strong backlogs, owing to underlying demand. Also, due to the essential nature of the business, the company’s demand remains robust. Pricing actions to mitigate cost inflation are supporting the bottom line. Solid global demand across end markets also bodes well for the company.Effective price realization and strength in both utility and industrial end markets are supporting XYL’s Water Infrastructure segment. The Applied Water segment is gaining from commercial and industrial end markets. Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is benefiting from a robust utility end market, primarily in the United States, due to strong backlog execution. Also, strong price realization and improvement in chip supply bode well.Xylem’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are noteworthy. In 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $217 million, up 6.9% year over year. In the first three months of 2023, it paid out dividends worth $60 million, up 9.1% year over year. The company bought back shares worth $52 million in 2022 and $8 million in the first three months of 2023. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.However, Xylem has been experiencing adverse impacts of cost inflation for a while. In the first three months of 2023, the company’s cost of revenues increased 12.1% year over year, while selling, general and administrative expenses rose 16.5%. High raw material, labor, freight and overhead costs are pushing up the costs of sales. Escalating costs pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. Additionally, higher strategic investments might dent margin performance.XYL’s extensive presence across international markets and its operations are subject to risks associated with unfavorable movement in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues.

(NYSE:MMM) stands out for its purpose-driven approach and forward-thinking strategies. With a solid business portfolio, relentless focus on innovation and strategic initiatives, the company is paving the way for a future filled with success.Forward-looking business modelThe industrial conglomerate has adopted a purpose-driven approach by focusing on a solid business portfolio, innovation and strategic actions. In addition, 3M aims to streamline and simplify operations, improve margins and enhance cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MMM. Click here to check it out. MMM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MMMPeter Lynch Chart of MMMTo meet these objectives, the company plans to optimize its cost structure by reducing corporate costs and management layers. By streamlining its supply chain, 3M intends to align planning, sourcing, manufacturing and delivery processes, thereby improving efficiency. Further, it plans to enrich its go-to-market models to be more inclined toward customer needs and prioritize high-growth markets.By prioritizing high-growth markets and investing in emerging areas (like carbon dioxide capture and removal), 3M shows it understands industry trends and customer demands. Moreover, its emphasis on digital engagement capabilities, factory automation and network optimization highlight its focus on leveraging technology for improved performance and efficiency.Regarding market prioritization, 3M has identified the key areas of automotive electrification, personal safety, home improvement, semiconductors and health care. Additionally, the company plans to invest in emerging sectors such as climate technology, industrial automation, next-generation electronics and sustainable packaging.Continuous improvement and leveraging digital capabilities are also integral to 3M's strategy. The company intends to invest in automation, data analytic, and cybersecurity while modernizing its technology infrastructure. By reducing its reliance on legacy systems and adopting cloud-based solutions, the company aims to enhance agility, flexibility and cost efficiency.Story continuesInvestment in Svante Technologies accelerates carbon capture solutionsIn addition to its internal streamlining, 3M has entered into a joint development agreement with Svante Technologies to advance carbon dioxide capture and removal technology.Svante's innovative process involves coating solid sorbents onto laminate sheets to capture CO2 emissions from industrial point sources and directly from the air. This technology has potential for a number of industries, including hydrogen, cement and steel.To support Svante's carbon capture technology, 3M Ventures participated in its recent fundraising round, raising $318 million. This investment will accelerate the development and manufacturing of the company's carbon capture solutions.The collaboration between 3M and Svante Technologies has made significant progress in addressing the pressing issue of carbon dioxide removal and combatting climate change. By combining Svante's expertise in capturing CO2 and 3M's filtration technology, the partnership aims to develop products capable of effectively trapping and permanently removing CO2 from the atmosphere.Overall, the scalability and commercialization potential of Svante's technology and 3M's global presence set the stage for the successful implementation of carbon-adsorbing solutions. As the world increasingly transitions toward a low-carbon economy, the demand for effective carbon removal technologies is expected to surge.Further, the partnership aligns with 3M's commitment to developing innovative solutions for global carbon reduction efforts.Strategic restructuring3M has observed strength in the automotive, automotive aftermarket, electrical and abrasives markets, but weakness in consumer electronics and retail. To navigate these challenges, the company is actively managing costs, prioritizing investments in productivity and adjusting to market trends.As part of its restructuring plan, the company announced layoffs in late April, which will affect 6,000 jobs globally. It also previously announced reductions of 2,500 manufacturing roles. This represents a 10% reduction in the company's workforce and are expected to lower costs in response to declining demand for electronics.In addition, 3M is reshaping its corporate structure and simplifying its supply chain and marketing model. It plans to reduce management layers across all business functions and geographical locations. These actions align with its focus on high-growth businesses such as electric vehicles and home improvement, as well as emerging industries like climate technology and next-generation electronics.While these initiatives require an upfront investment, 3M anticipates taking pre-tax restructuring charges of $700 million to $900 million. However, the company expects these actions to generate similar savings as well as expand margins and position it for future growth. Approximately half of the annualized savings are estimated to be realized in 2023.Further, legal liability risks related to PFAS manufacturing also pose challenges for 3M, which it is addressing. The discontinuation of PFAS chemicals by 2025 will have a financial impact between $1.3 billion and $2.3 billion, representing a smaller portion of revenue. 3M is significantly changing its business identity to adapt to sluggish volume growth.However, the company needs to address a number of issues for long-term growth. Effective management and mitigation of legal liability risks associated with PFAS manufacturing are crucial to protecting its reputation and financial stability. Discontinuing the production of these chemicals is a step in the right direction, but further actions may be necessary to regain consumers' trust.Although 3M's research and development efforts have yet to generate products to boost volume and expand margins in recent years, the company recognizes the necessity of adjusting its cost structure. Competitor General Electric (NYSE:GE), on the other hand, has shown positive progress, reporting its first positive free cash flow in nearly a decade thanks to its core aerospace division and robust market demand.Despite criticism of 3M's management for being overly optimistic with guidance, the company is actively taking steps to address the challenges and aims for favorable earnings growth in 2024. The focus on strategic objectives, cost management and market adaptation demonstrates its commitment to effectively navigating the current business environment.Overall, competition in the market remains intense, with companies like General Electric streamlining operations and capitalizing on market demand. As a result, 3M's management needs to be realistic with its financial performance to ensure investor confidence to sustain market valuations.Streamlining, Investments Pave 3M's Path to GrowthChanges in senior management3M recently made significant changes in its senior management team, including the firing of Chief Business Officer Michael Vale.As Vale was terminated for inappropriate personal conduct and a violation of company policy, the issue should not have a major impact on the company's underlying operations and financial performance.Following Vale's departure, Mike Roman, the chairman and CEO of 3M, assumed leadership of the Safety and Industrial, Consumer and Transportation and Electronics businesses. Other changes in the senior management team include Karina Chavez becoming group president of the consumer business, Chris Goralski taking on the role of group president of the safety and industrial business and Ashish Khandpur continuing as group president of the transportation and electronics business. Further, Jeff Lavers remains the group president of the health care business.3M faces opportunities and challenges as it moves forward from these changes . The company needs to rebuild its reputation and regain investors' trust following the dismissal of Vale, which will require the rapid implementation of strict ethical standards and reinforcing a culture of integrity throughout the organization. Further, the managerial disruptions may have harmed 3M's progress on stakeholder relations (qualitatively), making it hard for the company to differentiate itself in the market.Risks and downsidesOther risks for the company remain as well.First, 3M's strategy to prioritize high-growth markets presents a risk. The success of capturing significant market share in sectors like automotive electrification, personal safety and health care depends on competition, market demand and the company's ability to adapt to changing trends.Investing in emerging areas such as climate technology and sustainable packaging carries technological risks. The success of these investments depends on 3M's technological advancements, market acceptance and ability to leverage expertise effectively.Additionally, the recent changes in senior management and dismissal of the chief business officer raise concerns about its leadership and corporate culture. Any further disruptions or failure to address governance issues may impact investors' sentiment, productivity and the company's reputation.Further, the restructuring plan and cost reduction efforts may have short-term financial impacts due to restructuring charges and potential revenue losses from discontinuing PFAS manufacturing, which can further deteriorate market valuations.Finally, the legal matters related to PFAS manufacturing pose a significant risk to 3M's reputation and financial stability. Potential legal liabilities and associated costs can impact the company's financial performance.ConclusionIn conclusion, 3M's strategic initiatives, including streamlining operations, prioritizing high-growth markets and investing in emerging areas, demonstrate its commitment to driving growth and innovation. The company's diversified business portfolio and focus on critical sectors present opportunities for capturing market share and meeting evolving consumer demands.While challenges persist, 3M's history of innovation, strong reputation and adaptability provide a solid foundation for long-term growth and value creation. In addition, the company's collaboration with Svante Technologies and its commitment to materials science-based solutions highlight its forward-thinking approach to addressing climate change.Finally, by leveraging its expertise and embracing emerging opportunities, 3M has the potential to thrive in high-growth sectors and deliver sustainable growth for its shareholders.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The manufacturing giant will have a new CFO as it continues to separate into three public companies.GE announced on Thursday that Carolina Dybeck Happe, CFO at GE, will step down from her current role in September. Dybeck Happe is expected to remain an SVP at GE for a period of time to assist with the transition. “This is a time of tremendous momentum and accomplishment for GE,” she said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday. “It is a privilege to work alongside this extraordinary finance team.”Rahul Ghai will succeed Dybeck Happe, taking on the role of SVP and CFO. ""This is the right time to make this change as GE progresses toward launching GE Vernova and GE Aerospace as standalone businesses,” GE CEO Larry Culp said in a statement.GE’s first spinoff was GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC), which produces medical imaging equipment and tech devices. The company went public on Jan. 4. The next separation, GE Vernova, which houses the energy portfolio, has a spinoff planned for early 2024. That will leave GE Aerospace to continue as the entity that had been GE.Ghai has been the CFO of GE Aerospace since August 2022. So, from Sept. 1 until the GE Vernova spinoff occurs, he will continue to perform his current role while also serving as CFO of GE. After the spinoff, GE will become known as GE Aerospace, focused on aviation, and Ghai will remain the CFO, and Culp will be the CEO of GE Aerospace.Before GE, Ghai served in leadership roles including EVP and CFO at Otis Worldwide Corporation and SVP and CFO of Harris Corporation.During the past few years, Dybeck Happe “played a crucial role in helping to significantly reduce GE’s debt, improve our financial and operating performance, and build the strategy and execution of our spinoffs plan,"" Culp said. She joined GE in 2020 from Maersk where she served as CFO. Before Maersk, she spent 16 years at Assa Abloy, including seven years as CFO.Story continuesGE reported its Q1 2023 earnings in April. Revenue came in above expectations at $14.49 billion versus the estimate of $13.36 billion. ""We reported our first positive free cash flow in the first quarter in nearly a decade,"" Culp said in the earnings statement. GE Aerospace, the strongest segment, saw revenue rise 25% from a year earlier to $6.98 billion.The CFO transition ""we think most likely represents a 'normal course' transition as the company approaches its planned separation of GE Vernova,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. ""We view Mr. Ghai as a good fit for the role."" And with Dybeck Happe expected to stay on for a period, ""we surmise that the transition reflects an orderly succession process,"" they wrote. GE's stock price closed on Thursday at $104.1, up about 0.54%.GE and Dybeck Happe agreed that she will remain ""eligible for the severance benefits under her existing employment agreement and applicable equity award agreements if she resigns for 'good reason' on or before Feb. 14, 2024, as a result of the CFO transition,"" according to the company’s SEC filings.“Under Larry’s leadership, we’ve worked to transform one of the world’s most iconic companies,” Dybeck Happe said on LinkedIn. “My focus over the coming months will be to set our remaining businesses up for success as they launch as independent companies,” she said.Have a good weekend.

That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $55.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Valero shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Valero is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry that ranks in the Top 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $7.53 per share to $6.19 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Valero right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Between the onset of the war in Ukraine, surging inflation and concerns around macroeconomic policy, oil and gas were in the right place at the right time.However, things have moved in a sharply different direction more recently. The price of oil has slipped below the $75 per barrel mark again after moving above $100 last year. Meanwhile, the price of natural gas has experienced a full-on collapse following unfavorable winter weather.But the long-term outlook for energy still appears to be favorable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOver the past decade, few energy companies were willing to invest heavily in the sector amid the prolonged period of lower energy prices. In addition, regulatory constraints and environmental concerns have made it increasingly difficult for energy companies to tap into new supply. This should bode well for companies with an existing strong position in the industry, such as these three undervalued energy stocks.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is the world’s largest independent refining company with 15 different refining locations. Its scale and efficient operations have made it the lowest-cost refining outfit as well.Historically, refining has been a challenging industry. For decades, American refineries earned low profit margins and were subject to a brutal boom-bust cycle. But things have changed. For one, no meaningful new refineries have been built in America in decades, meanwhile some have closed down, which has improved the supply and demand picture. For another, the rise of fracking and other new oil production in North America has produced cheaper crude and led to higher refining margins versus imported feedstocks.Valero has generated windfall profits in recent years and is putting them to good use. It now has a dozen ethanol plants and produces 1.2 billion gallons per year of renewable diesel, giving it a leg up on the next era of fuel production.Story continuesDespite the core improvements in the business, investors aren’t giving the company much credit. VLO stock has slumped nearly 20% over the past month, leaving shares at just 5 times forward earnings. That’s a bargain.Halliburton Energy (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWith the revival in the energy sector since 2021, some demand has finally returned for new oil and gas drilling. Thanks to this, the long-dormant energy services sector has come roaring back to life.Halliburton Energy (NYSE:HAL) is a global leader in oilfield services, with extensive operations in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. Specifically, it helps oil producers with needs such as cementing, completion fluids, wireline solutions and much more. It has a particularly strong position in offshore oil fields, which can often be more lucrative.Given the underinvestment in the sector in recent years, there is currently a favorable supply and demand balance for companies such as Halliburton. This leads to strong pricing and profit margins.HAL stock has fallen 24% year-to-date. This puts shares at just 9 times forward earnings. Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) analyst Katherine Olexa views this as a compelling offer, with a fair value target of $40.Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comEnbridge (NYSE:ENB) is one of the dominant energy midstream companies in North America. It has a massive web of natural gas and liquids pipelines running between Boston, Orlando, Houston, Vancouver and countless points in-between. In addition, it has invested in power generation, producing enough power to be capable of serving approximately 966,000 homes.Enbridge is also focused heavily on shareholder returns. It has produced $1.2 billion in cost savings since 2017 while selling off various assets and making attractive investments in others at single-digit multiples. Enbridge has been a textbook example of how to modernize a business and move it toward improving sustainability and environmental targets while also producing shareholder value.The big appeal to ENB stock today is its compelling 6.8% dividend yield. There are plenty of high dividend yields out there in the market. However, it’s rare to get such a fat yield from a massive mission-critical business such as Enbridge with strong inflation-protected cash flows. The company also has a safe BBB+ credit rating, which stands out in an energy landscape where many companies have much less sturdy balance sheets.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ENB stock.

Still, according to a recent CNBC article, the plunge in fossil fuel prices may bottom out soon. Further, a more significant pickup may materialize in subsequent quarters. Let’s be real – the hydrocarbon sector disappointed speculators with a series of red-splattered sessions. However, circumstances might finally change for the better for sector bulls. “Now it definitely feels like they’re at the bottom — there are multiple signs of that,” said Citi’s Global Head of Commodities Research Ed Morse. With a higher demand season on the horizon combined with geopolitical rumblings, the optimism carries credibility.If so, you might want to consider getting into “black gold” before the bullish wave.

An integrated hydrocarbon player – meaning that it operates within all three segments of the industry’s value chain – Shell provides balanced exposure for those anticipating a sector-wide resurgence. Since the beginning of this year, SHEL gained nearly 8% of its equity value.On the financials, the company enjoys several decent (though not remarkable) stats. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 9.2%, ranking better than 53% of sector rivals.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 89% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about UnitedHealth Group. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that UnitedHealth Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of UnitedHealth Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in UnitedHealth Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 6.4% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.5b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in UnitedHealth Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Managed by Renaissance Technologies, the Medallion Fund stands as one of the world's most prosperous and enigmatic hedge funds. Established in 1988 by mathematician Jim Simons, the fund has consistently generated remarkable returns for its investors, earning a reputation for employing mathematical models and algorithms to conduct trading activities within the financial markets. With a current net worth of approximately $28 billion, Simons directs his attention beyond the daily trading of stocks and other financial assets. The unique approach employed by Simons and his former colleagues at Renaissance has yielded unprecedented annualized returns. During the March quarter, fund managers focused their attention on the U.S. financial sector, which experienced significant volatility as a result of the severe banking crisis, reminiscent of the 2008 financial meltdown. According to Reuters, securities filings released for the first quarter of 2023 reveal that Renaissance Technologies was one of the notable funds that invested in First Republic Bank. Renaissance Technologies acquired around 7.1 million shares of the bank during the first quarter and retained ownership of them until March 31, when they were valued at $13.99 per share.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies also significantly increased its investment in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) during the fourth quarter of 2022. Their holdings of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock grew by 18% to reach 4 million shares. The firm also acquired nearly 1.8 million shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), resulting in a stake worth $749,000 as of the end of March 2023. However, in this article, we discuss the top 15 stocks to buy and hold according to Jim Simons’ hedge fund, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Story continuesOur Methodology For this list, we selected top 15 stocks from the Q1 2023 13F portfolio of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksJim Simons of Renaissance TechnologiesBillionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top Stock Picks15. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $485,381,000Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) offers a comprehensive communications platform across various regions, including the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Their service, Zoom Meetings, enables users to engage in high-definition video, voice, chat, and content sharing on a wide range of devices such as mobile devices, computers, telephones, and conference room systems. In Q1 2023, Simons’ fund owned 6.5 million shares of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) worth $6.5 million, representing 0.64% of the total 13F securities. According to Needham analyst Ryan Koontz, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is expected to benefit from Microsoft's reported decision to separate Teams from Office. On April 24, the analyst maintained a Hold rating on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), stating that Teams has become a prominent collaboration platform for enterprises. The unbundling of Teams from Office increases the analyst's confidence in Zoom's ability to achieve a consensus growth rate of 5% in its fiscal year 2025. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q4 2022, 36 funds were long Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $719 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is one of the top stock picks of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies. Here is what Horos Asset Management had to say about Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”14. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,125,000The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) operates as a food and drug retailer in the United States. Securities filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed that Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies owned more than 10 million shares of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) worth $495 million, representing 0.65% of the total portfolio. On March 20, Northcoast analyst Chuck Cerankosky raised the rating on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) from Neutral to Buy and set a price target of $60. The stock has declined to the mid-$40 range due to the company's announcement of its intention to acquire Albertsons. However, the analyst believes that since the transaction is still a considerable time away, investors should instead focus on the value of The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) stock based on its own strengths. This was demonstrated in the company's recently released fourth-quarter results.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 50 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Oakmark Fund made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”13. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $495,718,000Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global company engaged in the research, development, production, marketing, distribution, and sale of biopharmaceutical products worldwide.

(NYSE:PFE) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $43 following the Q1 results. The analyst anticipates a difficult situation for Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in the upcoming summer months, as the effects of COVID and new product launches are expected to have a greater impact in the later part of 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared to 77 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 9.8 million shares worth $502.7 million. Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”12. United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $498,852,000United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR) is a biotechnology company that focuses on developing and bringing to market innovative products to meet the medical needs of patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening diseases.

The decision to trim the price target is primarily attributed to updated revenue projections specifically related to treprostinil-based products, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 49 hedge funds were bullish on United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR), compared to 47 funds in the earlier quarter. Kurt Von Emster’s VenBio Select Advisor is the biggest position holder in the company. 11. Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $506,437,000Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) specializes in royalties and streaming related to gold.

In the first quarter of 2023, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies owned 3.47 million shares of Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), worth $506.4 million and representing 0.67% of the total 13F securities. On May 4, H.C. Wainwright analyst Heiko Ihle has increased the firm's price target on Franco-Nevada to $180 from $145 and maintained a Buy rating on the company's shares.

Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.11 million shares worth $288.6 million. Here is what Horizon Kinetics has to say about Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back to basic principles. We don’t hold gold in client portfolios, we hold gold royalty companies. The two have surprisingly little in common. The gold royalty company generates very impressive profits even if the gold price never rises, and it earns those profits year after year. Here is a long-term chart of Franco Nevada Corp., the premier gold royalty company vs. gold itself: a comparable gold price today than a decade ago, yet Franco Nevada returned 12.5% annually, matching the S&amp;P 500 return, despite its nearsole source of revenues unchanged. What will Franco Nevada’s earnings and share price do if gold rises over the course of a decade?”10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Renaissance Technologies’ Stake Value: $526,124,000Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of Jim Simons’ top stock picks as of the first quarter of 2023.

The report indicated a decline in free cash flow, both with and without working capital, compared to both the previous quarter and the same period last year, primarily due to increased capital expenditure. Chevron also intends to continue expanding various new energy initiatives, including a significant carbon capture project at Bayou Bend. However, the company plans to focus its capital on higher-margin businesses, the analyst stated in the research note to investors.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were bullish on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 66 funds in the prior quarter. Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”9.

Looking ahead, Wells Fargo anticipates growing interest in the stock leading up to the Paris Air Show in June.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 53 hedge funds were bullish on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth $250.2 million. Jackson Square Partners made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“For The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)–in short, we believe the worst of Boeing’s idiosyncratic issues are behind it, the airframe duopoly remains as protected as ever, and at current prices (where we’ve been adding), the stock is trading around ~6x FCF on 2025E. Current airframe production is running materially below expected travel demand over the next 5-10 years, creating a structural supply/demand imbalance that we believe will drive a decade of strong growth in civil aerospace from here. In our 2Q’22 correspondence, we described the attributes of our ideal growth ballast and said we hoped to convert another in the coming months – we believe Boeing checks all those boxes.”8.

The company’s stock price had fallen roughly 17% from its peak in October 2021 on fears about Medicare reimbursement rates, and we used this dislocation to start purchasing shares of what we believe to be the most dominant and complete managed care company in the industry.With several at-scale and interconnected businesses, UNH occupies a unique position within the U.S. healthcare system. UnitedHealth has (a) a dominant managed care organization in commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets, (b) a large and growing presence in local care delivery (OptumHealth’s physicians and ambulatory service centers), (c) one of only three at scale pharmacy benefits managers (OptumRx’s PBM) and (d) a fast-growing healthcare information technology (HCIT), consulting and revenue cycle management (RCM) business (OptumInsight). The combination of the largest MCO (UnitedHealth) with the faster-growing, higher-margin Optum services businesses positions the company to capture a large portion of the future growth opportunities in the U.S. healthcare services industry. We expect balanced growth from both health insurance and health services leading to consistent high-single-digit revenue growth for the company. With margin expansion from scale, share buybacks from its strong cash generating ability (the company currently has $30 billion in net cash), and continued strategic acquisitions, we believe the company can generate mid-teens or better earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UNH shares were down slightly from where we re-initiated a position during the quarter, causing them to be a top detractor (-0.02%) in an overall strong quarter where few positions were down.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Jim Simons' 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Quantum Computing Companies in the World10 Least Digitized Industries That Are Ripe for Digital Transformation15 Best Countries for Americans to Live in Europe Disclosure: None.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire David Tepper's 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.So, what would happen to the economy if America were to default? Well, the government borrows money to fund a variety of programs and functions such as salaries and healthcare spending. This funnels money into the economy and stimulates productivity for a variety of businesses. In case of a default, this spending stops and a large amount of money is removed from the economy. How large? According to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the event can cut up to ten percent of the American economy until the government figures out how to raise money. Perhaps ironically, a default also increases the risk premium that investors lending to the U.S. government demand for their money, which then spirals into higher costs of borrowing for the consumer (for instance for mortgages) and more interest payments that the government has to make on its debt. In broader terms, a Democratic Party think tank estimates that the economy can lose as many as three million jobs and a 30 year mortgage could cost an additional $130,000 to fund.Story continuesIn this turmoil, how does one invest? Well, it's important to look at what hedge funds are doing especially since talk of the debt ceiling had started to emerge since January. Fortunately for us, hedge fund filings for the first quarter of this year have started to become available and one fund that is on our radar is billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Mr. Tepper is one of the richest people in the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth at $18.5 billion as of May 2023. He set up the hedge fund in 1993 and since then it has grown to manage billions of dollars in funds, with our research suggesting a portfolio value of $1.8 billion as of Q1 2023. The billionaire has a business school named after him, and he started his career working in a steel company. Mr. Tepper's astute management at Goldman Sachs during the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash earned him laurels in the industry, as he bought debt that had dropped in value at the time but then recuperated the losses after the market recovered - resulting in gains for the investment bank.Today, we'll look at Mr. Tepper's top stock picks as the clouds of recession remain on the horizon and lawmakers wonder if a default will really be that bad. Some top picks of the billionaire are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

Pricing actions have played a key role in uplifting the sales trends for industry participants. The companies focused on transforming operations, digital commerce growth, innovation and brand building have been gaining amid macro hardships.Nevertheless, the companies continue to toil with headwinds related to higher manufacturing and logistic costs, increased commodity costs, and lower volume. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending is expected to dent margins in the near term. Some of the players have been undertaking cost-curtailment actions to support margins, while coming up with the latest products and improved marketing efforts. Players like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, Colgate-Palmolive CL, Reckitt Benckiser Group RBGLY, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. CHD and The Clorox Company CLX have focused on these efforts despite the continued cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies involved in the manufacturing and supply of fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry.

Industry players have also been witnessing improved organic sales trends mainly on gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives.

Elevated manufacturing and distribution costs, as well as increased advertising and sales promotion expenses, are other factors impacting margins.

For example, on March 23, Barclays Investment Bank analyst Anthony Powell downgraded SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) from Equal-Weight to Underweight. SL Green closed at $21.37 the previous day, but on the day of the downgrade, it closed at $19.49, down 8.7%.The reverse is also true, in that analyst upgrades can cause stocks to spike higher quickly. But on this day, apartment REITs were set to sell off following Rosivach’s report. Take a look at the four REITs that were downgraded by this analyst:Essex Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: ESS): Rosivach downgraded Essex Property Trust from Peer Perform to Underperform.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA): He downgraded Mid-America Apartment Communities from Peer Perform to Underperform, while announcing a price target of $137.UDR Inc. (NYSE: UDR): Rosivach downgraded UDR from Outperform to Peer Perform and announced a price target of $71.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT): Rosivach downgraded Camden Property Trust from Outperform to Peer Perform.Shortly after Rosivach’s downgrade, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein also downgraded Camden Property Trust from Buy to Neutral, while cutting the previous price target from $132 to $121.The downgrades are interesting because recently these REITs had performed well according to first-quarter operating results and had received favorable ratings from other analysts.At the end of April, JMP Securities reiterated a Market Outperform on Mid-America Apartment, and RBC Capital Markets maintained a Sector Perform rating on it. Mid-America Apartment increased its first-quarter funds from operations (FFO) from $1.97 to $2.28 year over year, beating its first-quarter 2022 revenue by 11.12% and beating the analysts’ estimates on revenue.Story continuesTruist Securities maintained a Hold position on UDR and raised the price target from $43 to $46. UDR’s first-quarter adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was $0.57, up from $0.55 in the first quarter of 2022.Recently two other analysts reported favorable views on Camden Property Trust. RBC Capital reiterated an Outperform rating and a $130 price target, and Stifel maintained a Buy rating. Camden Property Trust had a great first-quarter earnings report, as Core FFO more than doubled from $0.76 to $1.66 year over year.As for Essex Property Trust, in early May, Piper Sandler upgraded Essex Property Trust from Neutral to Overweight and raised its price target from $242 to $271. RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating and raised its price target from $247 to $250. Essex Property Trust also had a good first quarter, with FFO rising from $3.37 to $3.65 year over year.Don't miss:How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketGiven the favorable ratings by other analysts, along with good first-quarter earnings and strong performances by the group, why would analyst Rosivach downgrade all four of these apartment REITs?It was because in looking ahead, he has expectations of an apartment sector slowdown. In his report to clients, he noted, “We think spring rent growth will have a challenging time keeping up with last year's blistering pace.""His forecast for the group is as follows:Essex Properties’ leasing spreads are now decelerating, with earnings growth of only 3% this year and 0% in 2024.For Camden Property, he sees earnings growth slowing to 6% in 2023 and 3% in 2024.UDR is forecast to have 8% growth this year but decline to 3% in 2024.Mid-America Apartments should have 2023 earnings growth of 9% but only 2% in 2024.It’s a brave call since 30-year mortgage interest rates are still in the mid-6 % range, deterring many renters from wanting or being able to buy a home. But 2022 saw large apartment rent increases, and despite cost increases, it will be difficult for landlords to keep tenants in place if they continue to raise rents at that pace. In the first half of 2022, the average price hike for new tenants was 12.2%. The 2022 median U.S. rent was up 5% to $2,305 per month.Still, Wall Street looks ahead, and many expect mortgage rates to decline if the Federal Reserve rate hikes in a continued effort to temper inflation. Should the economy fall into a recession, the interest rates and home prices would probably decline even further.For those who own any of these apartment REITs, Monday morning provides a wake-up call to how difficult it can be sometimes to own stocks. Mid-America was down 1.73% in the early going, and Camden Property Trust was down 1.23%. The other two REITs were also trading lower but by smaller amounts.What should investors do now? They should definitely not panic sell simply because of an analyst downgrade. Continue to do your own research and remember that the best analysts are only correct about half the time. In the example cited before where SL Green dropped to $19.49 following its downgrade, shares rebounded within a few days and by mid-April, SL Green was up near $26 per share.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft MSFT, Activision Blizzard ATVI and Sony's SONY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Just when investors thought the housing market would implode under the ""squared weight"" of (1) a steeply inverted yield curve and (2) the regional banking crisis, we are witness to homebuilders like PulteGroup putting up solid Q1 numbers and guidance that lift their prospects considerably.The reason that PHM is a Zacks #1 Rank now is that analysts launched their consensus estimates since that report from full-year EPS of $7.44 to $9.05.And next year's profit haul also moved higher from $7.24 to $9.00 per share.This rebound may mark the earnings trough not only for many homebuilders, but for real estate in general.Inflation and Interest Rates: Have They Peaked?This past weekend I published an article about the ""possible peak"" in my real estate-focused newsletter Multifamily Investing.You can read the full version at the link but here is a synopsis...The US economy is doing a pretty good job of absorbing the regional banking crisis.Despite the persistence of digital banks runs -- with short-sellers preying on blood in the water to drive out deposits by pummeling stock prices -- the stock market has held up well and the Federal Reserve signaled a pause in their efforts to battle inflation.Meanwhile, job creation, consumer spending, and housing markets remain strong according to a collection of robust data sets.This scenario sets up ""the pause"" for the Fed with interest rate hikes.That diverse body of economists, with tons of data and analysis at their disposal, has done a good amount to tamp down wildfire inflation.And while the yield curve will remain inverted for some time, the message is clear that they have taken a big bite out of the cost surges.Story continuesSo now we are seeing inflation stabilize across many sectors. Sure, 5-7% inflation in some sectors like Food &amp; Energy are alarming.But what matters now to investors is the trend direction and speed.And that trend is showing a new downward trajectory in inflation and a slowing in the rate of acceleration in either direction.History shows that this pattern leads to the fire being put out.Especially in the age of exponential technologies that tend to foster hyper productivity and disinflation. Honestly, when was the last time you had to worry about sending a check, a document, a photo, or yourself for a signature when they can all be done now instantaneously?What's the Impact for Real Estate?While I thought the regional banking crisis would have a bigger negative impact on mortgage lending than the positives of the Fed pause, I'm starting to reconsider that idea.In their article for Forbes Advisor, Mortgage Rate Forecast For 2023, Robin Rothstein and Chris Jennings (Editor) suggest that the inflation battle is being won and the market is recognizing this...Recent data indicates the Fed's tightening policy seems to be working, though some analysts say too well, given the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector. Nevertheless, headline inflation cooled to 5% in March for the first time in nearly two years and is well below its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. Even so, the current rate is still far above the Fed's 2% goal.The good thing about this article is that they quote a variety of real estate-focused economists and analysts sharing their views of the unfolding interest rate landscape.On the alarmed end of the spectrum comes this...""The latest interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unnecessary and harmful,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, in an emailed statement. ""(Small regional banks) are becoming zombie-like banks, unable to lend even to good businesses as they are more concerned with balance sheet shuffling for survival. This situation will worsen with each additional rate hike by the Federal Reserve.""Among the optimists were these forecasts...National Association of Realtors (NAR). ""[F]orecasts that ... mortgage rates will drop—with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate progressively falling to 6.0% this year and to 5.6% in 2024.""Compass U.S. region president, Neda Navab. ""There have been signals that mortgage interest rates may be at or near their peak, given recent encouraging news around inflation and a corresponding drop in the U.S. Treasury yields that help set mortgage rates. A sustained drop could push mortgage rates into the 5% range late in the second quarter or in the second half of 2023, but that's definitely not guaranteed.""Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). ""Long-term rates have already peaked. We expect that 30-year mortgage rates will end 2023 at 5.2%.""What About the Debt Ceiling Battle?We've seen this movie before and it usually gets resolved after some customary political brinkmanship.But the Forbes Advisor piece does share some additional views, including the idea that the uncertainty and potential for default will keep rates elevated into the summer.This remains the wild card for the spring home-buying season.The good news is that digital-centric financial markets are extremely quick at absorbing new information (good or bad) and discounting new trends.This means that barring a tumultuous US default event, inflation and rates are trending down, the regional bank crisis volatility is being absorbed by much bigger banks, and national lenders, builders, and investors will be modeling for rates in the 5% handle.And if the economy avoids recession, then all the bargains I was expecting in the Multifamily space may not unfold either.

On a year-over-year basis, revenues improved nearly 1%.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, total same-store net operating income (NOI) (at share) came in at $264.6 million compared with the prior-year quarter's $264.7 million.

This decision goes against the U.K. and U.S. authorities, who have concerns about the deal.The European Commission, after conducting its analysis, concluded that the acquisition would not harm competition. Microsoft made a promise to allow other companies in the cloud gaming market to offer popular games like Call of Duty on their platforms for the next ten years. However, the deal still faces legal challenges in the United States and the U.K., which could be difficult for Microsoft to overcome.The EU's decision is seen as positive for competition and is expected to give a boost to the cloud streaming market, which currently makes up a small percentage of the overall gaming industry.The EU's viewpoint contrasts with that of the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission, both of which had reservations about the deal. The main difference in opinions seems to revolve around how quickly the cloud gaming market will grow in the future.Overall, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has received EU approval but the deal's ultimate success depends on overcoming legal hurdles in the United States and the U.K. The decision by the EU shows confidence in the potential benefits of competition and growth of the cloud gaming market.What's the Problem with the Acquisition?The main problem with the acquisition is regarding the competition. Microsoft's gaming division would have too much of the industry, which could unfairly limit its competitors and ultimately harm consumers.In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wants to stop Microsoft from buying Activision, as they believe it could have negative effects. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also concerned that the deal could lead to higher prices and fewer options for gamers in the U.K.The CMA has issues with the solutions Microsoft proposed to address these concerns. The problem revolves around exclusivity – if Microsoft wants to benefit the most from the deal, they might make future games from Activision exclusive to Xbox and PC, leaving out Sony's PlayStation.Since Microsoft acquired Minecraft in 2014, the game has been available on platforms owned by Sony and others without any restrictions. As part of the ongoing discussions surrounding the Activision deal, Microsoft has made a commitment to keep Call of Duty, which has been a major point of contention, accessible on Sony and Nintendo platforms for ten years following the completion of the acquisition.Although the deal is approved by the EU, it may not go through. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had a dissenting opinion last month. CMA had cited cloud gaming market as a concern, which is now agreed by Microsoft. This could make the difference in CMA's decision.Microsoft's Gaming Prospects to Get a BoostThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is building an Xbox mobile store, which will offer games directly to mobile devices. Microsoft wants to add Activision Blizzard content to this store to build on its already existing communities of gamers.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks.For fiscal fourth-quarter Microsoft expects Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens due to third-party and first-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass.Microsoft's shares have gained 30.6% year to date, whereas the Zacks Computer and Technology sector have grown 22.7%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

408,e3fcab5a-eb9b-331b-944b-7524fe0beb93,DHI,2023-05-20,Is MDC A More Profitable Homebuilding Pick Than Tri Pointe (TPH)?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdc-more-profitable-homebuilding-pick-152203088.html,1684509723,STORY,"['TPH', 'DHI', 'MDC', 'NVR']","[After a long period of tepidness, the U.S. Housing market is rebounding. Limited existing inventory, stabilizing mortgage rates and improving industry trends are boosting buyers’ sentiments. Builders are also confident about future growth in the industry as inflation continuous to ease and rent growth are expected to slow down.Per the recent NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, Builder confidence for newly built single-family homes in May rose five points to 50 from April. This is the first time that sentiment levels have reached to the midpoint of 50 since July 2022. Also, housing starts in April increased 2.2%, the highest rate thus far in 2023, reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.Although the industry is still dealing with high construction costs, persistent labor shortages and tightening credit conditions for construction loans, these metrics are gaining traction. This is backed by smallest monthly gain in the housing inflation since January 2022, thereby cooling off inflation below 5% for the first time in the past two years.In addition to these positives, Construction industry employment (residential and non-residential) exceeds its February 2020 levels. The latest housing data encourages the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry bellwethers like M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC, Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. TPH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and NVR Inc. NVR, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 ( Strong Buy).Based on various parameters, let’s check whether MDC or Tri Pointe is a more profitable stock. It is to be noted that both companies are almost neck to neck in terms of market cap. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Determinants of the StocksMDC — with a market cap of more than $3.08 billion — engages in building and selling single-family detached homes for first-time and move-up buyers under the name “Richmond American Homes.”The company’s Build-to-Order process, also known as ‘dirt sales’, provides buyers with a wide range of choices in major aspects of their future home and personalized customer experience through in-house community teams. MDC’s Financial Services operations offer mortgage loans, insurance coverage and title agency services to its subsidiaries and customers in the United States.Tri Pointe — with a market cap of almost $2.96 billion — designs, constructs and sells innovative single-family detached and attached homes designed primarily for entry-level, move-up, luxury and active adult homebuyers. The company builds premium homes and communities in 10 states.The company has been benefiting from solid homebuilding industry fundamentals, land acquisition strategy and cost-control measures. Also, strong demographics and limited availability of homes are likely to support the company in the future. The company anticipates that potential homeowners will continue to seek homeownership despite rising home prices and increasing rental costs.Story continuesStrong Brand Presence &amp; Customer SpectrumAlthough MDC is a slightly bigger company in terms of market cap, Tri Pointe has a broad spectrum of customers as it serves luxury and active adults and entry-level and move-up buyers. Also, Tri Pointe’s homebuilding segments build attached and detached single-family homes, town homes and condominiums. Both companies’ investments in land acquisition and development are encouraging.Zacks Estimates &amp; Stock PerformanceOwing to intense inflationary pressure and persistent supply issues, the housing industry is likely to witness low revenues and earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MDC’s 2023 earnings indicates a 57.9% year-over-year fall. Tri Pointe’s bottom line for 2023 is likely to decline 44.6%. The companies’ earnings estimates have moved up in the past 30 days. Although Tri Pointe’s earnings expectation looks comparatively less gloomy, MDC has better Growth Score of A.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of MDC and Tri Pointe have gained 37.5% and 64.6%, respectively, this year compared with the industry’s 33.9% rally, the Zacks Construction sector’s 16% rise and S&amp;P 500 index’s 10.5% growth. Although the stocks have performed impressively, TPH fared better than MDC and the industry as a whole.A Look at Stocks’ Profitability &amp; ValuationReturn on Equity in the trailing 12 months for MDC is 16.3% compared with Tri Pointe and the industry’s 20.8% and 21.3%, respectively. Tri Pointe provides more impressive returns to investors than MDC.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for MDC and Tri Pointe is 6.46 and 5.57, respectively, compared with 6.76 for the industry. Tri Pointe’s shares are cheaper than MDC and the industry.Our TakeTri Pointe certainly has the edge over MDC as it has better customer spectrum, price performance, prospects and provides impressive returns to investors and is quite cheaper. The companies remain optimistic about overall homebuilding trends, given promising fundamentals and improving industry parameters.A Brief Overview of the Other Two StocksD.R. Horton: This Texas-based prime homebuilder continues to gain from production capabilities, industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points.D.R. Horton’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up to $11.01 per share from $9.08 in the past 30 days.NVR: This well-known homebuilder is benefiting from its lot acquisition strategy, which helps it to avoid financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. This helps it to operate in the cyclical industry and gain efficiencies and a competitive edge over its peers.Lennar’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved up to $423.83 per share from $394.69 in the past 30 days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Horton's (NYSE:DHI) Returns And Here's How They're Trending,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-hortons-nyse-dhi-141713960.html,1684505833,STORY,['DHI'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at D.R. Horton's (NYSE:DHI) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for D.R. Horton, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$6.8b ÷ (US$31b - US$5.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, D.R. Horton has an ROCE of 27%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Durables industry average of 17%. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton roceIn the above chart we have measured D.R. Horton's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for D.R. Horton.The Trend Of ROCEWe like the trends that we're seeing from D.R. Horton. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 27%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 119%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at D.R. Horton thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.What We Can Learn From D.R. Horton's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that D.R. Horton is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about D.R. Horton, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them is significant.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Citing antitrust grounds, the judge ruled that the deal was a “naked agreement not to compete.”The decision was a victory for the US Justice Department, which filed a lawsuit in 2021 to undo the arrangement. Now the airlines have 30 days to end the partnership, which has been running for the past 18 months, although they are expected to appeal the ruling.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesThe DOJ had predicted that air travelers would pay $700 million more a year if the deal was allowed to proceed.The Northeast Alliance (NEA) allowed the airlines to share ticketing codes and revenue, and engage in joint scheduling and gate pooling. The arrangement resulted in American Airlines changing some of its business routes, and both companies argued the partnership would allow them to compete more effectively with Delta and United Airlines. The companies expanded their partnership even as the case continued to be reviewed by the court.“We are disappointed in the decision,” a JetBlue spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. “We made it clear at trial that the Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers. Through the NEA, JetBlue has been able to significantly grow in constrained northeast airports, bringing the airline’s low fares and great service to more routes than would have been possible otherwise.”American Airlines said there was no evidence of consumer harm caused by the partnership. “The Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers and anything but anticompetitive,” a spokesperson told Quartz via email.The Justice Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.Story continuesA win for the antitrust-focused Biden administrationUS president Joe Biden signed an executive order in July 2021, directing his administration to break up up monopoly power across a variety of industries, including air travel.The win in the JetBlue-American Airlines matter comes as the DOJ awaits the outcome of another lawsuit it filed, in March, to stop JetBlue from acquiring Spirit Airlines. The government is arguing that the $3.8 billion merger also would raise prices for consumers.Spirit’s board of directors hesitated to approve the acquisition because of the DOJ’s antitrust goals, and both companies met with the DOJ in February to try to convince regulators not to sue but were unsuccessful.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

There was no evidence in the record of any consumer harm from the partnership.”JetBlue spokeswoman Emily Martin said her airline was disappointed, adding, “We made it clear at trial that the Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers.”The Justice Department, meanwhile, hailed the ruling.“Today’s decision is a win for Americans who rely on competition between airlines to travel affordably,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.The partnership had the blessing of the Trump administration when it took effect in early 2021. It let the airlines sell seats on each other’s flights and share revenue from them. It covered many of their flights to and from Boston's Logan Airport and three airports in the New York City area: John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty in New Jersey.Story continuesBut soon after President Joe Biden took office, the Justice Department took another look. It found an economist who predicted that consumers would spend more than $700 million a year extra because of reduced competition.American is the largest U.S. airline and JetBlue is the sixth-biggest overall. But in Boston, they hold down two of the top three spots, alongside Delta Air Lines, and two of the top four positions in New York.The Justice Department sued to kill the deal in 2021, and was joined by six states and the District of Columbia.“It is a very important case to us ... because of those families that need to travel and want affordable tickets and good service,” Justice Department lawyer Bill Jones said during closing arguments.The trial featured testimony by current and former airline CEOs and economists who gave wildly different opinions on how the deal would affect competition and ticket prices.The airlines and their expert witnesses argued that the government couldn’t show that the alliance, which had been in place for about 18 months at the time, had led to higher fares. They said it helped them start new routes from New York and Boston. And most importantly, they said, the deal benefitted consumers by creating more competition against Delta and United Airlines.The judge was not persuaded.“Though the defendants claim their bigger-is-better collaboration will benefit the flying public, they produced minimal objectively credible proof to support that claim,” he wrote. “Whatever the benefits to American and JetBlue of becoming more powerful — in the northeast generally or in their shared rivalry with Delta — such benefits arise from a naked agreement not to compete with one another.”Hanging over the trial was JetBlue's proposed $3.8 billion purchase of Spirit Airlines, the nation's largest discount carrier. In March, while Sorokin was mulling his decision, the Justice Department sued to block that deal too, arguing that it would reduce competition and be especially harmful to consumers who depend on Spirit to save money.JetBlue has countered that acquiring Spirit will make it a bigger, stronger low-cost competitor to Delta, United, Southwest — and American — which together control about 80% of the domestic U.S. air-travel market.The government's lawsuit against the JetBlue-Spirit deal is pending before a different judge in the same Boston courthouse.]"

Isom said that would boost top pay and benefits for a captain of single-aisle planes like the Boeing 737 to $475,000 a year in salary and retirement benefits, and $590,000 for pilots of bigger planes such as Boeing 777s and 787s.United and Southwest are in negotiations with their pilots, who are seeking to match or improve on the Delta deal.Pilots believe that a shortage affecting some carriers has given them more leverage at the bargaining table. They are seeking higher pay and improvements in scheduling.American pilots recently voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, although federal law makes it difficult for airline workers to strike.American spokeswoman Sarah Jantz said Friday that the airline was pleased to reach an “agreement in principle” with better pay, profit-sharing and improved quality-of-life provisions. “They deserve to be paid well and competitively,” she said.]"

Last year, the pilots turned down an offer that included a 19% pay hike over two years.Industry officials say Delta's pilot contract has become a new benchmark for contract negotiations in North America. It is fueling demands for higher wages at Canadian carriers, whose pilots want to narrow the pay gap with their U.S. counterparts.American had estimated that matching Delta's deal would cost it about $8 billion over four years.Story continuesDelta's pilots in March ratified their contract which includes over $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.It underscores pilots' bargaining power as airlines rush to boost staff numbers ahead of what is shaping up to be a busy summer travel season.American, Delta, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines are estimated to hire about 8,000 pilots this year.Analysts at Jefferies estimate the United States is short about 10,000 pilots.

419,9c557529-eaf3-357c-80d0-b95584329781,FCX,2023-05-20,5 Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Stocks to Watch in a Promising Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-non-ferrous-metal-mining-144502756.html,1684507502,STORY,"['HG=F', 'GC=F', 'SI=F', 'FCX', 'SCCO', '^GSPC', 'ARREF']","[Demand for non-ferrous metals is expected to be strong, mainly driven by the ongoing vehicle electrification and the increasing adoption of renewable energy, which will continue to support the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry. Also, the impending demand-supply imbalance is expected to help boost metal prices.Against this backdrop, we suggest keeping a close eye on companies like Southern Copper Corporation SCCO, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX), Coeur Mining CDE, Energy Fuels UUUU and Amerigo Resources ARREF. These companies are poised to gain from their endeavors to build reserves and control costs, while investing in technology and improving production efficiency.About the IndustryThe Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry comprises companies that produce non-ferrous metals, including copper, gold, silver, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, aluminum and uranium. These metals are utilized by various industries, including aerospace, automotive, packaging, construction, machinery, electronics, transportation, jewelry, chemical and nuclear energy. Mining is a long, complex and capital-intensive process. Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit, followed by the assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently, safely and responsibly, precede actual mining. The miners search for opportunities to grow their reserves and resources through targeted near-mine exploration and business development. They strive to upgrade and improve the quality of their existing assets, internally, as well as through acquisitions.What's Shaping the Future of the Mining-Non Ferrous Industry?Demand-Supply Imbalance to Support Prices: Gold and silver prices have gained lately, aided by the ongoing uncertainty around global economic growth, which has driven the safe-haven demand for metals. Copper prices had started this year on a strong note, fueled by investor expectations of a surge in demand after the reopening of the China economy. However, weaker-than-expected data from China has weighed on copper prices lately. Industrial production in China was up 5.6% in April, much lower than the market expectations of 10.9%. Property investment plunged 16.2% and home construction continued to decline. Despite this recent pullback in prices, the International Copper Study Group recently lowered its projection of growth of world copper mine production from 5% to 3% for 2023. This is mainly due to operational and geotechnical issues, equipment failure, adverse weather, landslides, revised company guidance in a few countries, and community actions in Peru. Per the body, copper is likely headed for a deficit of 114,000 tons in 2023. This will help boost copper prices. Overall, industry players are dealing with depleting resources, declining supply in old mines and a lack of new mines. Development projects are inherently risky and capital-intensive. While demand has been strong, there will be an eventual deficit in metal supply, leading to a situation that will bolster metal prices. This, in turn, will favor the industry in the long haul.Story continuesCost Control &amp; Innovation to Increase Efficiency: The industry has been facing a shortage of skilled workforce to date, which hiked wages. Labor-related disputes can be damaging to production and revenues. The industry players are grappling with escalating production costs, including electricity, water and materials, as well as higher freight expenses and supply-chain issues. Since the industry cannot control the prices of its products, it focuses on improving sales volume, increasing operating cash flow and lowering unit net cash costs. Industry participants are opting for alternate energy sources to minimize fuel-price volatility and secure supply. Miners are now committed to cost-reduction strategies and digital innovation to drive operating efficiencies. Strong Demand to Support the Industry: Demand for non-ferrous metals will remain high in the future, given their wide use in primary sectors, including transportation, electricity, construction, telecommunication, energy, information technology and materials. The demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy is expected to be a significant growth driver for metals like copper and nickel in the years to come. The plan to overhaul and upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and promote green policies per the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also require a huge amount of non-ferrous metals.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects for the near term. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #48, which places it in the top 19% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Mining- Non Ferrous Industry has outperformed its sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months.

Copper production in the quarter was 4.5% above the company’s guidance. Quarterly molybdenum production was 0.3 million pounds, 5.2% above the guidance. Strong credits from higher molybdenum prices cut down cash costs by 11%, or 23 cents per pound, compared to ARREF’s annual cash cost guidance of $2.14 per pound. The company expects copper production to be 62.3 million pounds in 2023. It outperformed its copper production for three consecutive years. Molybdenum production is expected to be 1 million pounds in 2023. Backed by its healthy cash balances, minimal debt and robust financial performance, the company continues its capital return strategy initiated in September 2021. ARREF declared its seventh consecutive quarterly dividend and continues its share buyback program.Vancouver, Canada-based Amerigo Resources is an innovative copper producer with a long-term relationship with Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer. It receives and processes the waste stream from Codelco to recover copper and molybdenum. Amerigo produces copper concentrate, and molybdenum concentrate as a by-product at the MVC operation in Chile by processing fresh and historic tailings from Codelco’s El Teniente mine, the world's largest underground copper mine. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 300%. The estimate has moved up 50% over the past 60 days. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: ARREFEnergy Fuels: In the first quarter of 2023, UUUU completed the sale of 300,000 pounds of uranium to the U.S. Uranium Reserve, realizing total gross proceeds of $18.47 million, or $61.57 per pound. This sale resulted in a gross margin of 58%. The company expects to sell an additional 200,000-260,000 pounds of uranium this year, per its supply agreements with U.S. nuclear utilities, at an expected sales price of $54-$58 per pound, leading to gross margins of 46-50%. It has made significant progress in preparing four conventional uranium and uranium/vanadium mines to resume ore production. The recent sale of the lower-priority Alta Mesa ISR Project will provide UUUU with significant additional cash and working capital, enabling it to ramp up its US industry-leading uranium and rare earth element (“REE”) production. The company continued to focus on growing its REE business. To this end, it has begun modifications and enhancements at the White Mesa Mill that will produce up to 1,000 MT per year of neodymium-praseodymium (""NdPr"") oxide by late 2023 or early 2024. UUUU plans to take up this figure to 3,000 MT by 2026.This Lakewood, CO-based company, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, exploration, processing, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium, vanadium and REE. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 253%. The estimate has gone up 263% over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Price &amp; Consensus: UUUUSouthern Copper: The company has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates world-class assets in investment-grade countries, such as Mexico and Peru. Its constant focus on increasing low-cost production is commendable. SCCO expects copper production in 2023 to reach 940,000 tons, suggesting 5% growth from the 2022 reported levels. This will be aided by the Peruvian production coming back on track, and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. The company’s capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments at the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico, and at the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. Southern Copper will gain from its efforts to grow in Peru, given that the country is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Phoenix, AZ-based company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 15.7% over the past 60 days. The estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 14.7%. SCCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. The company, which engages in mining, exploring, smelting, and refining copper and other minerals, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Price &amp; Consensus: SCCOFreeport-McMoRan: FCX’s exploration activities near existing mines, which are focused on expanding reserves, will drive growth. It is expected to benefit from the ongoing large-scale concentrator expansion project at Cerro Verde that will likely result in incremental annual productions of 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum. Cerro Verde's expanded operations will also offer cost efficiencies, and large-scale and long-lived reserves. It is assessing a large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material. The expansion at Morenci increased milling rates. The Lone Star project in eastern Arizona has been completed and is on track to produce more than 200 million pounds of copper annually. The company is looking to advance studies for potential expansions and long-term development options for its large-scale sulfide resources at Lone Star. It is also ramping up underground production at Grasberg in Indonesia, resulting in a spike in milling rates. The focus on cost management and reduction of debt levels is commendable.Based in Phoenix, AZ, Freeport-McMoRan is engaged in mineral exploration and development; mining and milling of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver; and smelting and refining copper concentrates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FCX’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 2% over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Price &amp; Consensus: FCXCoeur Mining:  The company reported total production of 69,039 ounces of gold and 2.5 million ounces of silver in the first quarter of 2023. The numbers were higher than expected, aided by solid performances at Palmarejo, Rochester and Wharf. Production levels are expected to increase in the second half of the year due to mine plan sequencing, as well as the anticipated ramp-up and commissioning of the Rochester expansion. As of Mar 31, 2023, the Rochester project was 82% completed. Approximately $634 million of the estimated project capital has been committed, of which $560 million has been incurred. CDE’s solid balance sheet positions it well to support the remaining Rochester expansion capital requirements.This Chicago, IL-based company explores, develops, and produces gold, silver, zinc and lead properties with five operations in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 53%. The estimate has moved up 50% over the past 60 days.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) share price has soared 158% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. In the last week the share price is up 2.0%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 15% in the last twelve months. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 21% per year, is even more impressive. Before spending more time on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.Story continuesFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Other top prizes went to projects in the fields of computational biology, animal sciences and neurobiology.Congratulations to the top winners in the 2023 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, a program of Society for Science. (Photo by Chris Ayers Photography/Society for Science)The top winners were honored during two award ceremonies, the first of which took place on the evening of May 18 and featured Special Award winners. The Grand Awards Ceremony was held on the morning of May 19 and included the announcement of the top prize of $75,000. In total, nearly U.S. $9 million was awarded to the finalists, who were evaluated based on their projects' creativity, innovation and depth of scientific inquiry. The competition featured over 1,600 young scientists representing 49 states and 64 countries across the world.Kaitlyn Wang won first place and received the $75,000 George D. Yancopoulos Innovator Award, named in honor of the pioneering drug researcher and Regeneron co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer, for finding an efficient way to identify certain exoplanets that orbit very closely around their stars. Previous techniques used to detect these ultra-short-period planets required enormous computational power but were not as effective at identifying these planets. Kaitlyn surmounted that problem by creating a special algorithm that runs on cheap hardware and results in much faster and higher-precision findings. Using her research, she says she found the smallest of these planets ever discovered.Story continuesSaathvik Kannan, 17, of Columbia, Missouri, received one of two Regeneron Young Scientist Awards of $50,000 for using biocomputational methods to understand the causes of heightened infectivity in the disease mpox after it reemerged in 2022. Saathvik's approach, named Bioplex, uses a combination of machine learning and three-dimensional comparative protein modeling to decode structures like those that enable the mpox virus to replicate. This allowed him to identify the mutations in the virus that likely made it more infectious as well as other mutations that could make it resistant to antibiotics. Saathvik believes scientists will also be able to apply Bioplex to future outbreaks of other viruses.Teepakorn Keawumdee, 17; Pannathorn Siri, 16; and, Poon Trakultangmun, 18, of Bangkok, Thailand, received the second Regeneron Young Scientist Award of $50,000 for developing an innovative incubation chamber that promotes the survival of the green lacewing insect, a natural predator of the mealybug, a harmful pest. In nature, the green lacewing has a low survival rate, but the team's new system increased the lacewing's survival rate five-fold. In field tests, their incubation system was an effective alternative to insecticides and lowered the mealybug population density nearly four-fold.""Congratulations to the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair 2023 winners,"" said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO, Society for Science and Executive Publisher, Science News. ""I am humbled by the creativity and determination demonstrated by these exceptional students and proud of all they have accomplished with their outstanding research abilities. Together, these students from various academic disciplines and geographies are solving the world's most intractable problems.""Regeneron ISEF provides a global stage for the best and brightest young scientists and engineers around the world. Through this competition Regeneron and the Society support and invest in the next generation of leading STEM innovators who are generating ideas and acting as catalysts for the change needed to improve the well-being of all people, society and the planet.""We are thrilled to celebrate this year's Regeneron ISEF finalists as they join our growing community of bold individuals tackling the world's most pressing challenges,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""I applaud today's finalists and all the ISEF participants for their relentless pursuit of groundbreaking ideas that ignite positive and sustainable change in our world. I owe so much of my passion for science to the experiences and mentors I had in high school, and I hope that today is just the beginning of a lifelong commitment to STEM for many of these students.""Other top honors from the competition include:Natasha Kulviwat, 16, of Jericho, New York, received the Gordon E. Moore Award of $50,000 for Positive Outcomes for Future Generations for her search for biomarkers to help prevent suicides. By analyzing de-identified brain tissue from 20 people, Natasha measured levels of two proteins, cytokine and claudin-5, and found that neuroinflammation and claudin-5 were increased in the brains of suicide cases. Her work suggests that high levels of the protein claudin-5 could serve as pre-markers for suicide and that certain anti-inflammatory drugs might decrease claudin-5 levels.Yuyang Wang, 16, of Shanghai, China, received the Craig R. Barrett Award for Innovation of $10,000 for his development of an inchworm-style stick-climbing robot. This type of robot conventionally has grabbers that allow it to climb over and under obstructions like a caterpillar does, but he added skateboard-like wheels, which allow it to perform better than existing inchworm-style robots when the angle is less than 22°. The hybrid wheel/grabber assembly is novel, and he believes his robot will work well for tasks that are potentially dangerous to humans, such as inspecting damaged high-voltage lines.Rishabh Ranjan, 17, and Gopalaniruddh Tadinada, 17, of Louisville, Kentucky, received the H. Robert Horvitz Prize for Fundamental Research of $10,000 for building a custom, automated system to detect gastrointestinal cancer before serious symptoms appear. The team's system combines robotics and machine learning to analyze blood samples to identify healthy patients, as well as those with pancreatic, colorectal or hepatic cancers, in only three hours at an estimated cost of only $300. Detecting these cancers before they metastasize could make treatment much simpler and more effective.Eugene Chen, 16, of Shanghai, China, received the Peggy Scripps Award for Science Communication of $10,000 for his inexpensive energy-saving device that recycles the condensation produced by air conditioners to improve their energy efficiency. His device directs the cooling fan's airflow to spray the air conditioner's condensation at its own condenser, lowering its temperature and thus reducing power consumption and improving its energy efficiency. Eugene believes his easy-to-install device can reduce the amount of electricity used by air conditioners by more than 10%.More information about the top winners and visual assets can be found at https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-isef-2023-media-kit/Daniel Levin, 18, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Alexander Plekhanov, 17, of Portland, Oregon; and Kevin Zhu, 18, of Old Westbury, New York received the Dudley R. Herschbach SIYSS Award, which provides the finalists with an all-expenses-paid trip to attend the Stockholm International Youth Science Seminar, which includes attendance at the Nobel Prize Ceremonies in Stockholm, Sweden.George Cheng, 17, of Cary, North Carolina, and Yik Chun John Peng, 17, of Shanghai, China received the EU Contest for Young Scientists Award, which is presented to two projects that will represent Regeneron ISEF at the EU Contest for Young Scientists to be held in Brussels, Belgium, September 13-17, 2023.Full list of all award-winning ISEF 2023 FinalistsFull list of Special Award ISEF 2023 FinalistsIn addition to the Top Award winners, 450 finalists received awards and prizes for their innovative research, including ""First Award"" winners, who each received a $5,000 prize.

REGN lost 6.3% in a month compared with the industry’s decline of 2.8%.Earlier in the month, Regeneron delivered better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results. However, lead drug Eylea (aflibercept) sales declined. Shares declined in response to the same.Lead drug Eylea’s sales in the United States were $1.4 billion, down 6% year over year, primarily due to an increase in sales-related deductions. Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY.Regeneron’s lead drug, Eylea, is approved for various ophthalmology indications and has been a consistent performer, but sales are under pressure due to increasing competition from Roche’s RHHBY Vabysmo.In January 2022, Roche won FDA approval for Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A. The European Commission also approved Vabysmo (faricimab) for these indications.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.On a positive note, the FDA accepted the biologics license application (BLA) for the priority review of aflibercept 8 mg for treating patients with wet AMD, DME and diabetic retinopathy, with a target action date of Jun 27, 2023.A regulatory application has also been submitted for treating wet AMD and DME in the European Union (EU) and Japan. Regeneron is now focused on the potential launch of aflibercept 8 mg following a tentative approval.Shares of Regeneron are still up 5.4% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 7.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron’s top line is being boosted by its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent. Its partner, Sanofi SNY, records global net product sales of Dupixent. Dupixent maintains its dominant position, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Story continuesRegeneron also records net product sales of Praluent in the United States and Sanofi records net product sales of Praluent outside the United States and pays the company a royalty on such sales.Both companies recently announced that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Amgen, ending a nearly decade-long patent dispute related to Praluent.  The decision affirms the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s opinion, which held that Amgen’s asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims were invalid.Meanwhile, Regeneron is also looking to diversify in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

UNP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2095621/3-railroad-stocks-to-watch-amid-the-industry-weaknessProspects of Zacks Transportation - Rail industry's participants are being dented due to challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel price and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corp., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesFocus on Cost Cuts to Drive the Bottom Line: The industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and the effects of a weaker-than-expected demand scenario.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices lately, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods, especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Weak Freight Demand: Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1% on a month-on-month basis in March. In fact, the index has declined month on month in six out of the last seven months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Rail industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173. This rank places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7.6% since May 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 2.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite's gain of 3%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.51X. It is also above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.3 Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereUnion Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States. Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders, even in the current uncertain scenario, are impressive. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) is an added positive. Union Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprises, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is 2.28%.CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to-truck transfers.CSX is trying to drive growth in this challenging environment by reducing operating expenses. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. CSX has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprises, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 7.76%.Norfolk Southern: We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2023, the company's board announced a 9% uptick in its quarterly dividend payout to $1.35 per share. NSC's strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities.Norfolk Southern has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 4.66%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

428,cbe7bf11-3666-38b7-8634-e2473171c2dd,DGX,2023-05-20,Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-incorporated-nyse-dgx-163142921.html,1684513902,STORY,['DGX'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Quest Diagnostics' (NYSE:DGX) recent performance, when its stock has declined 12% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Quest Diagnostics'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Quest Diagnostics is:14% = US$859m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Quest Diagnostics' Earnings Growth And 14% ROEAt first glance, Quest Diagnostics seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Quest Diagnostics' moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Quest Diagnostics' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is DGX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether DGX is currently mispriced by the market.Is Quest Diagnostics Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?In Quest Diagnostics' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (or a retention ratio of 79%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 28% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Quest Diagnostics' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Cisco, Inc. (CSCO) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+89.9% vs. +42.4%). The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. The stock was up big following the last quarterly release on February 22nd and Nvidia fans will be hoping for a repeat perforance it comes out with quarterly numbers this coming Wednesday (May 24th).A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Cisco have modestly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+16.1% vs. +15.5%). The company’s end-to-end security is benefiting from strong demand for Cisco’s unified threat management and zero trust offerings.Cisco witnessed strong demand for its products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Meraki, and Nexus 9000 offerings. Expanding growth opportunities for low-power-consuming technologies, including IoT, Silicon One and Power over Ethernet bodes well for Cisco.

Earnings is expected to grow at a higher rate than revenues driven by gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management.(You can read the full research report on Cisco here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have declined -1.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s decline of -4.5%. The company has been battling cost-related headwinds and expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and United States.Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2023 and is likely to drive performance in the full year.A focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Synopsys, Inc.

430,74b945ef-66fb-3ac5-9435-c96df5b74a29,GPS,2023-05-20,7 Stocks to Dump as Warren Buffett Sounds Economic Alarm,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-dump-warren-buffett-185301532.html,1684176781,STORY,"['RIVN', 'PACW', 'GPS', 'NLS', 'CVNA', 'LDI', 'PTON']","[When legendary investor Warren Buffett speaks, people listen, which might not bode well for those exposed to the below stocks to sell. Primarily, Buffett believes that the “extraordinary period” of excessive spending following the Covid-19-inspired stimulus package is over. Now, businesses must face certain harsh realities.In particular, companies directly exposed to the consumer market may face inventory buildup. Eventually, if circumstances don’t substantively improve, they’ll need to rid themselves of this excess through promotional sales. Of course, that will cut into profitability. As well, the broader decline in consumer confidence will likely affect embattled enterprises of other sectors. Therefore, investors should keep a close eye on the below stocks to sell.GPSGap$7.93NLSNautilus$1.14CVNACarvana$11.36RIVNRivian Automotive$13.42PACWPacWest Bancorp$4.97LDILoanDepot$1.68SIGSignet Jewelers$73.85InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockFashion apparel maker Gap (NYSE:GPS) hasn’t had a great start to the year. Actually, it’s been downright terrible. Since the Jan. opener, GPS lost more than 30% of its market value. Over the past 365 days, GPS fell down nearly 35%. Fundamentally, with the Generation Z demographic not placing as much emphasis on fashion compared to older cohorts, Gap lacks distinction.Financially, Gap seems to be racing against time, making GPS one of the possible stocks to sell. On the balance sheet, Gap’s equity-to-asset ratio sits at 0.2, ranked worse than 83.21% of companies in the cyclical retail industry, per investment resource Gurufocus. As well, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 1.96, straddling uncomfortably close to the line that separates the gray zone from distressed.Operationally, Gap’s three-year revenue growth rate lands at 0.6% below zero. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 24.3% below breakeven. Combined with a negative trailing-year net margin, GPS makes a case for stocks to dump.Story continuesStocks to Sell: Nautilus (NLS)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockWhen competitors suffer woeful troubles, you must pounce on the opportunity, as cynical as that sounds. It’s all part of gamesmanship. That’s why it’s so disappointing that exercise equipment manufacturer Nautilus (NYSE:NLS) didn’t gain any ground on the recall issue hampering rival Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON). For the year, PTON slipped 14%. In contrast, NLS gave up nearly 26% of equity value. Frankly, it’s one of the stocks to sell for that reason alone.According to Gurufocus, Nautilus might be a possible value trap. It’s not hard to see why. Currently, the market prices NLS at a trailing multiple of 0.11. On paper, Nautilus ranks better than nearly 99% of the competition. However, a multiple that low might not be sustainable moving forward in the post-pandemic environment. Looking at the balance sheet, I’m more convinced that NLS ranks among the stocks to dump. For one thing, Nautilus carries higher debt than it really should. As well, its Altman Z-Score sits at 1.18, indicating conspicuous distress.Stocks to Sell: Carvana (CVNA)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockOutside any other context, online auto retailer Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) might seem a sterling buy. Since the beginning of this year, CVNA gained nearly 127% of its equity value. However, the framework deceives. For instance, on the May 12 session, CVNA tanked more than 12%. At least part of the reason why Carvana shares skyrocketed this year centers on short-squeeze speculation.However, as my former InvestorPlace colleague Vince Martin used to say, at some point, the fundamentals matter. For me, Carvana suffers from a serious pricing problem that traditional dealerships – and private-party transactions – don’t have to deal with higher rates in exchange for convenience. Bluntly speaking, no one’s scared of Covid-19 anymore. Therefore, charging people extra (in the form of comparatively higher car prices) for home deliveries won’t cut it. Also, its financials present problems. Its trailing-year net margin sits at 11.7% below zero. Also, its Altman Z-Score is 0.64, indicating significant distress. Along with a very high debt load relative to cash, CVNA ranks among the stocks to sell.Rivian Automotive (RIVN)earningsSource: ShutterstockWhen Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) entered the electric vehicle scene, I personally rooted for it. Having seen them up close and personal on our roadways, my opinion is that Rivian EVs are absolutely gorgeous. Plus, they provide much-needed competition to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which apparently took cues from Porsche about recycling designs over and over and over…Unfortunately, as brilliant as Rivian may be on the road, RIVN simply stinks in the chart. Since the Jan. opener, shares tumbled almost 26%. In the trailing one-year period, they’re down nearly 52%. Since making its public market debut till the time of this writing, RIVN dropped 90%. So, in the spirit of keeping it real, RIVN is one of the stocks to sell. To be fair, you can’t blame Rivian entirely for its troubles. A brewing price war means that the company may have to fight a war of attrition. Sadly, I’m not sure that with bleeding margins, RIVN can jump higher in the near term. For now, it’s one of the stocks to dump.PacWest Bancorp (PACW)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockUnless you’ve deliberately turned off the news since March, you know that regional banks face a significant credibility crisis. Up to this point, three banks have failed so far this year. Unfortunately, a few other banks could join this ignominious list. One possible name could be PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW). To be 100% clear, PACW could rise higher. But if I had to guess, it’s one of the stocks to sell.Irrespective of its financial position – which is poor – PacWest faces an ugly dilemma. And to be fair, it’s not necessarily its fault. Amid the three bank failures, the U.S. government made clear that it will protect depositors. It will not protect shareholders of collapsed institutions. Of course, this circumstance translates to PACW stakeholders holding an incredible amount of risk.At any moment, irrespective of management’s efforts to calm investors’ nerves, PacWest could fail. Sadly, this situation leaves its shareholders in an extremely precious position. Therefore, PACW ranks among the stocks to dump.LoanDepot (LDI)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockA nonbank holding company that sells mortgage and non-mortgage lending products, LoanDepot (NYSE:LDI) seemed reasonable speculation when Uncle Sam injected the economy with cheap money. But as the Oracle of Omaha stated, the U.S. government turned off the monetary spigot. In turn, we have a higher interest rate environment. So, it’s best not to overcomplicate the argument: LDI ranks among the stocks to sell.Primarily, two factors work against LoanDepot. First, higher borrowing costs make mortgage accessibility much more difficult, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Therefore, it’s no surprise that LoanDepot’s three-year revenue growth rate now sits at 4% below zero. Essentially, the company’s total addressable market diminished.Second, higher interest rates tend to spark a deflationary dynamic; that is, fewer dollars (due to monetary tightening) chase after fewer goods. In other words, we could suffer a recession. Under such a scenario, LoanDepot wouldn’t exactly be a stellar investment. Thus, LDI represents one of the stocks to dump.Signet Jewelers (SIG)stocks to sell a group of businessmen holding their thumbs down. worst investments of 2020Source: ShutterstockBefore I get any hate mail about Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG), at the moment, its financials seem fine. If anything, an argument could be made that SIG is undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 6.39. As a discount to earnings, Signet ranks better than 91.58% of the competition. So, why mention SIG as one of the stocks to sell?Up a bit over 9% for the year, it beats the benchmark equities index. However, some questions have arisen that cloud Signet a bit. Specifically, in April, a CNN report noted that Signet disclosed that the Covid-19 crisis “…dented sales of engagement rings as relationships faltered or never even blossomed in the first place due to the lockdowns.”More recently, Signet sees a dramatic decline in dating. Therefore, this circumstance created “an engagement gap.” Again, the financials at the moment don’t show any glaring signs of distress. Overall, Signet features a solid balance sheet. Also, it remains a profitable enterprise. However, continued impact in the romance scene could spell trouble for SIG.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
