In the end, the investment manager was able to come up with more accurate wildfire estimates, which helped it negotiate higher interest rates on deals.', 'Cat bonds, now a $47 billion market, were devised to allow insurers to transfer the financial risk from rare but highly destructive natural disasters to the capital markets. Investors get access to potentially huge returns if a pre-defined catastrophe doesn’t hit, but the bonds can be wiped out if it does.', 'Last year, cat bonds soared 20% in value, leading hedge funds like Fermat Capital Management to generate their best-ever results. Less specialized investors have started to buy cat bonds and European regulators are even considering allowing retail investors to hold them. Insurers, meanwhile, are issuing new cat bonds at a “record-setting pace,” according to ILS researcher Artemis.', 'Pricing the risk just right is what it’s all about for cat-bond investors, and some of them are brilliant at it. But the exercise is getting harder.', 'Instead of giant earthquakes and hurricanes, insurers are increasingly plagued by cumulative losses from smaller, more-frequent events. These so-called secondary perils, including wildfires, floods and thunderstorms, are being exacerbated by global warming.', 'Last year, the hottest on record, secondary perils accounted for 86% of global insurance losses, according to insurance broker Aon Plc. Mid-sized events that cause $1 billion to $5 billion in losses are now the fastest-growing type of natural disaster, says Swiss Re, the world’s second-largest reinsurer after Munich Re.', 'Read More: World’s Best Hedge Fund Bet Bumps Up Against New Era of Risk', 'This shift is a concern for cat-bond investors. Twelve Capital, which invests in the securities, says the basic models frequently underestimate losses from secondary perils. Tenax Capital, another specialist ILS investor, warns of the growing hazards associated with secondary perils that are often bundled into cat bonds in a way that makes it hard to estimate the risk implications.', '“The disconnect between modeled risk probabilities and bond spreads, especially where secondary perils are involved, indicates that models have room for improvement,” Tenax said in a statement.', 'About 40% of today’s cat-bond market is made up of securities that cover aggregate losses, which is where investors are most likely to feel the fallout of secondary perils, according to Artemis, which tracks unusual insurance strategies.', 'Moody’s Insurance Solutions, a risk modeler for the insurance industry, says buying cat bonds today without devoting serious time to understanding the dynamics of secondary perils is a bad idea.', '“We encourage all our customers to have their own view of risks, using the best possible science,” said Ben Brookes, managing director for consulting services at Moody’s Insurance Solutions.', 'Hurricanes have counterclockwise winds rotating around a central eye, and there are decades of recorded data on wind speeds, sea surface temperatures and other variables to aid statistical models for such primary perils. But wildfires and storms tend to be amorphous, to affect larger geographic areas and to be continually changing form. That means traditional models won’t work for secondary perils.', 'Weber says Elementum is now doing its best to make up for holes in existing models. For larger storms, for example, “we’ll do our own risk assessment, if we see the wind losses have been quantified, but not the risk of flooding,” he said.', 'Verisk Analytics Inc., another big catastrophe modeler, says its offering is improving. The insurance-risk specialist updated its model for severe convective storms — a form of secondary peril — in 2022.', 'The company used machine-learning techniques to analyze two decades’ worth of radar data, “making it one of our most intensive updates,” said Adil Imani, director of ILS at Verisk Extreme Event Solutions. He said Verisk now knows “every single point of every single event for 20 years.”', 'The revised model reveals a meaningfully altered picture of how thunderstorm risk is evolving. According to Verisk, severe thunderstorms in the US are now affecting areas somewhat to the south and east of what’s known as Tornado Alley, and climate change looks set to further alter those dynamics.', 'Roger Grenier, senior vice president of Verisk’s global resilience practice, says its data points to a rise in severe storms.', '“Over the long term, we expect to see a 10% increase in conditions favorable for storms to form,” he said.', 'Such information still needs to be combined with data capturing population density, so that modelers can figure out the likelihood of a bad storm affecting insured buildings. But things like property values, insurance deductibles and premiums aren’t disclosed in granular detail in the offer document of a typical cat bond. That’s because insurers that issue such bonds want to shield the data from rivals.', 'Weber of Elementum said some commercial models “are designed more for clients to fill out forms” for regulators, but aren’t that useful for cat bond investors deciding on a daily basis whether to buy or sell.', 'Commercial modelers “aren’t the practitioner that’s taking on the market risk,” Weber said. “We’ve often found their models wanting.”', 'Read More: The Hedge Fund Using Science to Bet Against Nature, and Win', 'Karen Clark, a pioneer of catastrophe modeling and chief executive of Karen Clark & Co. in Boston, said there’s clearly a need for “more advanced physical-modeling techniques,” which need to be supported by vast amounts of data and computing power. The firm updates its models every two years on average, mainly to account for climate change.', 'The secondary perils that are hardest to model are winter storms, such as the five-day freeze that crippled large parts of North America in February 2021, Clark said. To calculate the risk, researchers must assess three “hazard intensity footprints,” including wind, snow and ice, she said.', '“Each sub-peril has to be modeled separately for each event and then the losses combined appropriately,” Clark said.', 'The enduring challenge will be to assess the forward-looking impact as the planet warms.', 'Relying on historical patterns of loss “is like driving a car by looking at the rear mirror,” said Maurizio Savina, who manages the development of climate models at Moody’s Insurance Solutions. “The future isn’t like the past.”', 'Read More: More Hurricanes, Softer Pricing Make Bet Trickier: BI', '(Adds details around modeling in 16th paragraph.)', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Corporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor', 'Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits', '‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA', 'How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags', 'Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and Amazon AMZN.', 'Walmart shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target and Home Depot.', 'From the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%.', 'Walmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.', 'Walmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd.', 'Walmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th.', 'Target shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop.', 'With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.', 'The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +54.5% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 57.1% beating revenue estimates.', 'The online players and restaurant operators have struggled to exceed EPS and revenue estimates in Q1. In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.', 'With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 21 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.', 'As noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.', 'We will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.', 'The bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 460 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 10th. We have almost 400 companies reporting results this week, including 7 S&P 500 members. In addition to Walmart and Home Depot, this week’s line-up includes Cisco Systems, Deere & Company, China’s Alibaba, JD.com, and many others.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 460 index members are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.', 'The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context.', 'Earnings growth for these companies would have been +7.9% instead of +4.8% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.', 'As we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.', 'Looking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.', 'As you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture.

Wall Street expects an annual gain of 3.4% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, a decrease from the 3.5% headline number in March. Prices are set to rise 0.4% on a month-over-month basis, in line with March's rise."", 'On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.6% year over year, a slowdown from the 3.8% increase seen in March.

This, Zentner\'s team argues, could keep three Fed interest rate cuts on the table this year.', '""Weaker monthly prints ahead with faster disinflation starting in [the second half of 2024] provides the Fed the confidence it needs that inflation is on a sustained path toward target,"" the Morgan Stanley team wrote.', ""This would likely be a welcome sign for markets, according to Fundstrat's head of research Tom Lee."", '""We think April CPI could push higher the number of Fed cuts [priced into the market],"" Lee wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This, Lee said, would be a ""positive for stocks.""', 'Entering the week, markets are currently pricing in less than two interest rate cuts this year, per Bloomberg Data.', 'With the Fed holding interest rates high for longer, economists continue to watch closely for any signs that the resilience in consumer spending is dwindling.', 'A fresh reading on that trend is set to greet investors on Wednesday with the April retail sales report. Economists expect that retail sales increased 0.4% in April from the prior month, down from a 0.7% increase seen in March.', 'Investors will also be closely watching results from Home Depot (Tuesday) and Walmart (Thursday) for signs of how the US consumer is holding up. Thus far, results from corporates have provided mixed results on how Americans are spending.', '""Spending data have continued to surprise to the upside, but we get the sense households are increasingly prioritizing purchases,"" Wells Fargo\'s team of economists wrote in a weekly research note.

Investors started the year cheering the data as they priced in a ""soft landing"" for the US economy, where inflation would return to the Fed\'s 2% target without an economic downturn. At that time, the S&P 500 moved higher with Citi\'s Economic Surprise Index, which gauges whether data is coming in better than consensus expectations.', 'But after recent hot inflation data, markets have been more skittish as investors have increasingly priced in ""no landing,"" where inflation doesn\'t come down to the Fed\'s target but the economy keeps growing.', ""This had led to the market perceiving good economic news to be bad news for inflation, and therefore bad for the market's rate cut hopes. Subsequently, the correlation between the S&P 500 and economic surprise has headed toward negative territory."", '""This suggests hot macro data has increasingly threatened the soft landing narrative that may be needed to push markets higher from these elevated valuation levels,"" Chronert wrote.', 'If inflation data returns to showing further cooling, the question is whether good economic growth news will be once again welcome by the market.', 'Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, April (3% previously)', 'Earnings: BuzzFeed (BZFD), Petrobras (PBR), Stone (STNE), Tencent Music Entertainment (TME)', 'Economic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, April (88.2 expected, 88.5 previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, April (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, April (+2.2% expected, 2.1% previously)', 'Earnings: Alibaba (BABA), Home Depot (HD), Canoo (GOEV), Rumble (RUM), Sony (SONY),', 'Wednesday', 'Economic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, April (+0.4% expected, +0.4% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, April (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); CPI, year-over-year, April (+3.4% expected, +3.5% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, April (+3.6% expected, +3.8% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, April (+0.6% previously); MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending May 10 (+2.6%); Retail sales, month-over-month, April (+0.4%% expected, +0.7% previously); Retail sales ex auto and gas, April (+0.1% expected, +1% previously); NAHB housing market index, May (51 expected, 51 previously)', 'Earnings: Cisco (CSCO), Dole (DOLE), Monday.com (MNDY), Super League (SLE)', 'Economic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending May 11 (233,000 previously); Housing starts month-over-month, April (8.6% expected, -14.7% prior); Building permits month-over-month, April (+1.6% expected, -3.7% prior); Philadelphia Business Outlook, May (8.7 expected, 15.5 prior); Import prices, month-over-month, April (+0.2% expected, +0.4% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, April (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); Industrial production, month-over-month, April (+0.2% expected, +0.4% previously)', 'Earnings: Walmart (WMT), Applied Materials (AMAT), Baidu (BIDU), JD.com (JD), John Deere (DE), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Under Armour (UAA)', 'Economic data: Leading index, April (-0.2% expected, -0.3% previously)', 'Earnings: No notable earnings.', 'Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Because Fisher said he\'s ""always believed"" that ""they are just about as crazy and out of their minds as you can be.""', 'Fisher, 73, said that the central bank management ""never"" knows what to do as it\'s reactive. To drive this point home, Fisher reminded everyone that just a month before the Fed\'s first 75bps rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that he was not even ""thinking about"" raising rates by 75bps.', 'Ken Fisher has been bullish on the economy over the past several months. Rate hikes, the inflation storm, banking crisis and global uncertainty did not waver Fisher\'s belief that we will come out of this crisis unscathed. But in his latest interview Fisher voiced concerns about some of the threats he believes are not yet ""priced in."" Fisher is worried about ""big surprises"" that can impact global stocks and global GDP. Fisher said in financial markets everyone is usually worried about more or less the same things. But sometimes threats can slip through the cracks and we don’t see them coming. Ken Fisher said a classic example of this surprise is mark-to-market accounting rules implemented in 2007 which ""hugely took the mortgage problem and amplified it to write $2 trillion off of global bank balance sheets.""', ""However, Fisher reiterated that he's bullish on the market right now."", '""But whenever I am bullish I am still looking for risks.""', 'Fisher\'s worries about the geopolitical chessboard stem from what he called the nuclear-armed triangle: China, India and Pakistan.

Fisher said that when ""garbage"", low-quality IPOs start to flood the market, you should start worrying about a bubble.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Align Technology, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.16 = US$677m ÷ (US$6.2b - US$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""Thus, Align Technology has an ROCE of 16%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 10% it's much better."", ' See our latest analysis for Align Technology ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Align Technology compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Align Technology  for free."", ""On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Align Technology doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 34% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""To conclude, we've found that Align Technology is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 15% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", ""One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Align Technology that you might find interesting."", ""While Align Technology isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Moreover, within technology, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon all share something else in common: Each of them is a dominant force in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).', ""Beyond mega-cap tech enterprises, I see another player quietly emerging at the intersection of cloud AI infrastructure. Let's break down how Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is making notable strides in AI, and analyze the company's path to a trillion-dollar valuation."", 'According to Statista, Amazon is the top cloud infrastructure provider with 31% market share as of the end of the first quarter this year. Microsoft and Alphabet round out the top three, with 25% and 11% market share, respectively. With just 2% market share, Oracle trails its big tech cohorts by a considerable margin.', ""However, Oracle's operating results over the last several quarters are quite impressive. For example, through the first nine months of Oracle's fiscal 2024, ended Feb. 29, the company's cloud services revenue grew 26% year over year to $14.5 billion. In the most recent quarter specifically, cloud services increased 25% year over year to $5 billion. By contrast, Amazon's cloud business grew 17% year over year in its most recent quarter."", 'Although Amazon is a much larger cloud operation, Oracle is currently growing at a faster pace. I think this demonstrates that cloud infrastructure, in general, is experiencing accelerated growth, and businesses are using platforms outside of the top three providers. These secular tailwinds should bode well for Oracle over the long run.', 'Outside of revenue, one of the most important metrics that Oracle reports is remaining performance obligations (RPO). RPO is important because it provides investors with a preview of revenue that has been booked but not yet recognized.', ""At the end of the most recent quarter, Oracle's RPO grew 29% year over year and reached an all-time high of $80 billion. Furthermore, during the earnings call, management told investors that roughly 43% of these RPOs will be recognized as revenue over the 12 months."", ""Considering Oracle's backlog is growing faster than its reported revenue, I think it's safe to say that demand for the company's cloud services is robust."", 'The chart below illustrates consensus analyst estimates for revenue and earnings per share (EPS) for Oracle over the next couple of years. While these metrics are expected to accelerate, the growth rates might appear somewhat muted compared to other software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.', ""One reason for this is that Oracle is experiencing declining growth in its on-premise business. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Oracle's on-premise cloud operation generated $3.2 billion in revenue -- a decrease of 11% annually."", 'While this may look like a blemish or even a risk, it actually makes some sense. As on-premise services continue migrating to the cloud, Oracle actually has an opportunity to transition this decelerating component of its business to a new growth leg.', ""Considering Oracle's position in the cloud market relative to larger players, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, the general consensus is that the company will take longer to scale, a view I'm aligned with."", ""Right now, Oracle's market cap is roughly $320 billion and the company trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just 6.3. It's easy to see that Oracle trades at a considerable discount to Microsoft specifically, and is trading modestly lower than Alphabet."", ""Considering the rate at which Oracle is growing, combined with its opportunity to turn its on-premise business into a major growth engine, I think there is a good argument to be made that the company's valuation could rise considerably over a long-term horizon -- possibly making the estimates above somewhat conservative."", ""In other words, as cloud database management continues to be an important pillar of the overall AI narrative and digital transformation efforts at the enterprise level, Oracle's valuation multiples should eventually see some notable expansion and the company could one day reach trillion-dollar status."", 'But what investors must realize is that this transition is going to take time.

Is this the case with Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX)?"", ""Starbucks released earnings for the second quarter of its fiscal 2024 on April 30, and the results weren't great. Actually, they were pretty poor. Year over year, comparable-store sales declined 4%, operating income was off 6% to $1.15 billion, and margins contracted despite rising prices. The result was a sharp drop in the stock price, which is now down more than 15% year to date, as shown below:"", 'While rising prices help to compensate for a decline in foot traffic, this is a chicken-and-egg situation: Falling traffic may also result from higher prices. The increase in remote work, competition from local shops, growing national chains such as Dutch Bros, and declining consumer sentiment are significant challenges for Starbucks.', ""Q2 also spotlighted its strategy in China. The country is a major part of Starbucks' plans for growth, as the North American market is largely saturated. But the struggles in China continue. Comparable-store sales declined a whopping 11% there, driven by geopolitical tensions and a relatively weak Chinese economy."", ""It's no surprise that the stock plummeted, given the immense challenges highlighted in Q2. But what about the long-term prospects?"", 'Starbucks\' management is aware of the obstacles and announced a reinvention strategy in late 2023. The plan includes leveraging its digital footprint by doubling its number of reward members (currently 75 million), working with Microsoft to create personalized customer options, and exploring ""just walk out"" payment technology. The company plans to expand its footprint in the U.S. selectively with drive-thru-only and other efficient locations, while continuing to expand aggressively overseas.', 'Finally, management believes it can become more efficient and save $3 billion over the next three years.

The company is authorized to repurchase another 30 million shares. The price drop is a terrific opportunity to do this at a lower cost.', ""The answer is simple. If you believe Starbucks' business is permanently damaged, the stock is not a buy.

Overall, the report didn't leave much to be desired, and shares have cratered 14%."", ""Let's dig into Starbucks' earnings report and analyze why I see a different coffee chain stock as the better buy."", 'Analyzing retail businesses can be daunting. For starters, when a retail company reports revenue growth, it can be misleading, because investors often are not told how much of this growth is derived simply from price increases.', ""Moreover, considering retail businesses are constantly opening and closing locations, it can be hard to assess a company's organic growth trends. For this reason, one of the most important metrics for retail businesses is same-store sales."", ""Same-store sales can be seen as a more useful metric than revenue growth because it measures activity from stores that have been open for at least one year. This provides investors with an important view of the company's foot traffic, and how those trends may lead to further expansion or closures of the retail outlet in question."", 'For the period ended March 31, same-store sales declined by 4% year over year. Of note, comparable sales dropped both domestically in the U.S. and internationally -- including major markets such as China.', ""In addition to a deceleration in same-store sales, management cited another challenge during the earnings call -- and I found this one to be quite concerning. Starbucks' CEO Laxman Narasimhan admitted that the coffee chain is struggling to spur demand other than a daily influx of morning commuters."", 'Over the last couple of years, inflation has been unusually high. As a result, the Federal Reserve has instituted a number of interest rate hikes. The combination of higher prices and rising borrowing costs have undoubtedly weighed on consumer pricing power.', 'One area where Starbucks may be losing some momentum is value. I think that Starbucks is falling behind with consumers due to its prices. Although prices of goods and services have risen across the board over the last couple of years, Starbucks is perceived as a luxury brand -- and its food and drinks are expensive compared to alternatives.', 'A smaller chain called Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) has demonstrated some impressive growth over the last few years, and I suspect that some coffee enthusiasts are opting for this in lieu of Starbucks.', ""For the period ended March 31, Dutch Bros reported that same-store sales rose 10% year over year. Moreover, revenue for the quarter increased 40% year over year. By comparison, Starbucks' revenue growth during the quarter was flat."", 'Given the robust operating results, Dutch Bros raised its full-year 2024 revenue and profit guidance. Unsurprisingly, this is much different than Starbucks, which lowered its guidance following the poor earnings tape.', 'The chart benchmarks Dutch Bros against a cohort of restaurant-adjacent companies. With a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 2, Dutch Bros is the least expensive stock in the peer set based on this measure.', ""While this might appear as if Dutch Bros is dirt cheap, I'd caution investors from such thinking. While Starbucks is facing some headwinds at the moment, it is still a much larger and financially robust operation. And yet when looking at the P/S multiples above, Dutch Bros is actually in line with Starbucks."", ""However, considering the company's organic growth and positive outlook, I think the premium is warranted for Dutch Bros. Generally, for any retail business, the biggest challenge will be expansion. For now, Dutch Bros is largely a West Coast operation. Considering Starbucks has locations in 80 countries, Dutch Bros has a long way to go before it reaches commensurate scale."", 'I think investors that are looking for some growth opportunities outside the obvious sectors such as technology, healthcare, or energy may want to consider Dutch Bros. As far as consumer discretionary businesses are concerned, the company has established itself as more than a niche player.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Phillips 66's shares on or after the 17th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of June."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.15 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.60 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Phillips 66 has a trailing yield of 3.2% on the current share price of US$145.60. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Phillips 66's payout ratio is modest, at just 32% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 63% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's positive to see that Phillips 66's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Phillips 66 earnings per share are up 2.8% per annum over the last five years. Earnings growth has been slim and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Phillips 66 has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Has Phillips 66 got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Phillips 66 paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Phillips 66's dividend merits."", ""On that note, you'll want to research what risks Phillips 66 is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Phillips 66 (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

This therapeutic area is projected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Novo Nordisk is one of the clear market leaders -- for now -- thanks to its now-famous therapy, Wegovy. However, several companies have promising pipeline candidates they hope will eventually challenge Wegovy."", ""One of them is Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), one of the largest biotechs in the world. Amgen recently announced some news regarding its weight-loss pipeline, including the leading candidate therein. Let's find out what investors should make of these developments."", ""Amgen has talked about two notable weight-loss candidates in recent quarters. One of them is MariTide, which is currently in a phase 2 study. The other, AMG786, was undergoing a phase 1 clinical trial. During its first-quarter earnings conference call, Amgen said it would no longer pursue the development of AMG786. That's a bit of a setback for the drugmaker, but it is still going after the more promising of the two, MariTide."", ""Though Amgen hasn't yet shared many details about its ongoing mid-stage study for MariTide, it is clear that management sees it as an incredibly promising candidate. CEO Robert Bradway said the data the company has seen so far is very encouraging. Amgen is already drawing the outlines of a phase 3 study, though it plans to release data to the public from the ongoing trial later this year."", ""Thankfully, we do have some publicly available results from a phase 1 clinical trial for MariTide published in Nature. The broad lines are: MariTide proved effective at reducing weight and, importantly, at keeping the weight of studied patients down for up to 150 days after the treatment ended. That's one of the Achilles' heels of popular weight-loss medicines like Wegovy."", ""Though they effectively reduce body weight, some research has shown that many patients cannot maintain most of the weight loss after they stop taking the medicines. Here's another advantage MariTide may have over Wegovy. The latter is administered as an injection once a week. MariTide is a monthly injection, which, for most patients, will be preferable."", 'Amgen also has several pre-clinical anti-obesity programs it is working on right now.', ""The weight-loss market is an ideal target for Amgen, whose sales growth has been somewhat inconsistent in the past couple of years despite brand-new approvals. In the first quarter, the company's revenue increased by 22% year over year to $7.4 billion, although much of that increase was due to an acquisition. That aside, Amgen's top line was 6% higher than the year-ago period, a decent performance for a biotech giant."", ""Still, it will be several years before MariTide hits the market, if it goes that far. Investors shouldn't put too much weight on this candidate yet although it does look promising. However, the broader point is that Amgen is doing what it is supposed to do: develop brand-new therapies to get around the fact that some of its older medicines have struggled."", ""The biotech's October acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics for about $28 billion also allowed it to get its hands on several pipeline candidates, not to mention a promising medicine in Tepezza that treats thyroid eye disease and has been on the market since early 2020."", ""Amgen is on the verge of more brand-new approvals, too. These include cancer drug tarlatamab, which could earn the green light by mid-June. With its innovative wheel in full swing, Amgen's financial results should be fine."", ""And here's one more perk of investing in the company -- the company offers a competitive dividend program. Amgen has increased its payouts by 55% in the past five years and its forward yield tops 3% today. Amgen looks like a solid buy for long-term, income-seeking investors, not just because of its promising weight-loss medicine."", 'Before you buy stock in Amgen, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amgen wasn’t one of them.

This column focuses on undervalued blue-chip stocks likely to turn red-hot in the coming quarters.', 'I have focused on precious metals, commodities and the energy sector to identify undervalued blue-chip ideas. The reason is impending rate cuts in the next few quarters. In general, expansionary policies translate into the flow of funds into risky asset classes. Commodities and energy prices tend to trend higher.

Even with relatively stubborn inflation, it’s likely that the first-rate cut is coming before the end of 2024. This positions gold for further upside.', 'Specific to Newmont, the first positive is an investment grade balance sheet. The company ended Q1 2024 with a cash buffer of $2.7 billion. Further, operating cash flow for the quarter was $776 million. With gold trending higher, OCF will likely swell, and Newmont will be positioned to increase dividends.', 'From a long-term perspective, Newmont ended 2023 with 136 million ounces of gold.

For 2023, Occidental reported operating cash flow of $5.5 billion.

It pays to pay attention to what he is buying.', 'There are four Buffett stocks in particular that investors should dive deeper into right now.', 'Few stocks have outperformed Visa (NYSE: V) or Mastercard (NYSE: MA) since they went public. Over the past decade alone, both stocks have more than quadrupled in value. The S&P 500, in comparison, rose by just 234% over the same time period.', 'What has made Visa and Mastercard shares so special? The same factors make both stocks a buy today. Namely, they operate high-quality businesses that benefit from network effects. That is, the larger these businesses become, the more powerful they get.', ""Right now, when it comes to credit cards and debit cards, Visa has a 61% market share in the U.S. Mastercard, meanwhile, has the second largest market share with around 25%. Just four companies control nearly 100% of the U.S. market, with fourth place coming in with just a 2% market share. In other words, this is a highly consolidated market. That's thanks to network effects."", ""Visa and Mastercard have been around for decades. They've established trust and reputation among regulatory agencies, security analysts, merchants, and everyday consumers. This trust makes merchants more willing to accept payments on both networks. It also attracts more customers, which attracts yet more merchants since these parties want to accept what the customer can pay with. It's a positive feedback loop, one that has led to natural market consolidation."", ""Visa and Mastercard have greatly benefited from their duopoly market positions. Profit margins for both companies are around 50% -- a significant rise from 2010 levels of roughly 30%. This rise in profitability shouldn't be surprising. After all, businesses that benefit from network effects tend to grow stronger as they scale. And since both businesses are asset-light, greater scale means greater profitability."", ""As with any high-quality business, both stocks are expensive. Visa currently trades at 31 times earnings, while Mastercard trades at 36 times earnings. But with the S&P 500 as a whole trading at 27 times earnings, that's not a steep premium to pay for two of the most profitable stocks in Buffett's portfolio."", 'Buffett is a big fan of bank stocks. Berkshire owns several in its portfolio. Two of these bank stocks are near opposites in many ways, yet both are buys.', ""The first bank stock to know about in Berkshire's portfolio is Citigroup (NYSE: C). The position is worth roughly $3 billion and has been in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2022. Back then, the share price was around $60 -- very close to where shares are valued today. If you want to piggyback on a Buffett stock, this is your chance."", 'Why is Berkshire betting $3 billion on Citigroup? The biggest factor may be valuation. Citigroup stock trades at a 40% discount to book value. That is, the market believes the company to be worth 40% less than the listed accounting value of its assets. In comparison, Bank of America -- another Buffett stock -- trades at a 16% premium to book value. Citigroup has posted poorer returns on capital, but if its management team manages a comeback, expect the book value discount to narrow quickly.', ""Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) is another promising bank stock in Berkshire's portfolio. Nu was created to take Latin America's banking industry by storm. It was one of the first banks to take a digital-first approach, offering its services to anyone with a smartphone. In its first decade of operations, the business went from zero customers to over 90 million. More than half of all Brazilian adults are now Nu customers."", ""Nu isn't a value stock like Citigroup. Shares trade at 8.9 times book value. But with a market cap of only $57 billion, it's not hard to see how Nu could double or triple in size this decade merely by tapping its existing markets. Entering new countries in Latin America, meanwhile, could add even more growth potential. High multiple stocks like this can be volatile, but Berkshire has maintained its $900 million stake since 2021 without selling a single share. Patient investors looking for maximum long-term growth should consider joining in."", 'Before you buy stock in Citigroup, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Citigroup wasn’t one of them.

Since its initial public offering in May 2006, the credit card payment processor's shares have skyrocketed 9,670% (as of May 6), crushing both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index."", 'Now, with a market cap of $418 billion, this financial stock has certainly made its early shareholders wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. However, prospective investors who missed the boat might have their eyes on this successful business.', 'Can Mastercard make you a millionaire one day?', ""When it comes to finding stocks that can make you rich, it's important to try to identify outstanding businesses. Mastercard is one of the highest-quality companies you can find."", 'It possesses an extremely wide economic moat. Popularized by Warren Buffett, this term means that a business has a set of traits that allow it to defend itself against competition or new entrants in an industry, resulting in impressive financial performance over extended periods of time. ', ""In Mastercard's case, it benefits from powerful network effects. With billions of cards and over 100 million merchant acceptance locations, the platform is invaluable to its stakeholders. It would be almost impossible for someone to create a competing network from scratch."", ""That's because they'd need to solve the so-called chicken-and-egg problem. Why would merchants want to plug into this hypothetical network when there are no cardholders? And why would anyone want to carry a card in their wallet when no one accepts it? "", 'Mastercard also has sizable growth potential. Between 2018 and 2023, revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared at compound annual rates of 10.9% and 16.1%, respectively. The gains have been relatively consistent, driven by the rise of cashless transaction methods all across the world. This trend is set to continue for the foreseeable future.', ""What's worth mentioning is that Mastercard doesn't require much capital to capture this growth opportunity. A carmaker like Ford constantly needs to reinvest billions of dollars in research and development or manufacturing capacity. And streaming leader Netflix must also pour billions in cash each year to produce and acquire compelling content."", 'Because the payments rails are largely built out, Mastercard can avoid this game. The result is the generation of a lot of free cash flow, to the tune of $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024. This allows the leadership team to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.', ""I think the ideal situation is when investors can scoop up shares of a great business that's going through temporary issues. That's because this implies that the current valuation would be cheap, but over the long term, the company should perform well as it gets back on strong footing. As it generates improved financial results, the market should reward the stock with a higher valuation."", ""Unfortunately, Mastercard doesn't fit this category. This business isn't facing any challenges. In fact, it continues to produce strong financial results. In the latest quarter, revenue and EPS jumped 10% and 30%, respectively, boosted by strong cross-border payments activity. "", ""Consequently, the valuation looks expensive at a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.7. That multiple is cheaper than the stock's trailing 10-year average. However, it represents a significant premium to the broader S&P 500's P/E ratio of 22.6."", ""The valuation might be justified, given the quality of this company. Mastercard can allow its shareholders to sleep well at night, as there isn't much volatility in the underlying business's result."", ""Let's return to the original question of whether or not the stock can make you a millionaire one day.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' See our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Johnson & Johnson had debt of US$33.6b at the end of March 2024, a reduction from US$52.9b over a year. However, it also had US$26.2b in cash, and so its net debt is US$7.41b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Johnson & Johnson had liabilities of US$48.7b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$53.2b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$26.2b as well as receivables valued at US$14.9b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$60.8b.', 'Since publicly traded Johnson & Johnson shares are worth a very impressive total of US$360.8b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.', 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', ""Johnson & Johnson has a low debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.24. And remarkably, despite having net debt, it actually received more in interest over the last twelve months than it had to pay. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. Fortunately, Johnson & Johnson grew its EBIT by 7.8% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Johnson & Johnson's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Johnson & Johnson recorded free cash flow worth 77% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""Happily, Johnson & Johnson's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Looking at the bigger picture, we think Johnson & Johnson's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Johnson & Johnson , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth.

However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', ""Our information suggests that Medtronic plc insiders own under 1% of the company.

The trial is evaluating the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT antibody, and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, compared to KEYTRUDA alone, as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV). At a pre-planned analysis, data showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria. A higher rate of discontinuation of all adjuvant therapy by patients in the coformulation arm versus the KEYTRUDA-only arm, primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences, rendered it highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS. Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Data analysis from this study is ongoing. Results will be shared with the scientific community and communicated to regulatory agencies.', '""Through our clinical development program, we continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of KEYTRUDA, with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Mosaic, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.053 = US$995m ÷ (US$23b - US$4.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""Thus, Mosaic has an ROCE of 5.3%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Chemicals industry average of 9.5%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Mosaic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Mosaic ."", ""Things have been pretty stable at Mosaic, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Mosaic doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why Mosaic is paying out 33% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""We can conclude that in regards to Mosaic's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Since the stock has gained an impressive 40% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high."", ""On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Mosaic   you'll probably want to know about."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

It's not a large company. According to our good friends at S&P Global Market Intelligence, SNC has only about 5,000 employees, only a few more than work for drone-maker Kratos Defense & Security, and just a tiny fraction of the workers at aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE: BA)."", 'And yet last month SNC beat out Boeing to win a contract to build the ""Doomsday"" airplanes that protect U.S. presidents and defense secretaries in time of war.', ""SNC's new Air Force contract hires the defense company to supply four new aircraft to replace USAF's existing fleet of E-4B Nightwatch Advanced Airborne Command Posts (AACP) by July 2036. And that's just to start with. The contract, valued at $13.1 billion, could more than double in size if the Air Force follows through on its plans to eventually buy between eight and 10 of the planes over time."", ""While Sierra Nevada is itself a defense manufacturer, it's likely to buy commercial airplanes from another manufacturer -- maybe even Boeing itself -- and then heavily modify them to perform their Doomsday functions, hardening them against electromagnetic pulses for example, installing advanced sensors and communications gear, and utilizing other technology."", ""Boeing itself may end up serving as a mere subcontractor on SNC's contract, after being eliminated from the AACP competition in December. As Reuters reported last year, Boeing refused to agree to a fixed-price contract to build the airplanes. That's understandable, seeing as Boeing has reported losses of $16.3 billion on fixed-price contracts it signed with the Pentagon over the past decade. But it's probably still a disappointment for the company's shareholders."", ""According to CFO Brian West, Boeing has decided to pass on future defense contracts when winning them would require it to commit to fixed prices. On the plus side, that's probably a good policy if winning these contracts would entail losses for Boeing."", ""On the other hand, it seems almost certain to mean Boeing's status as a major defense contractor is going to decline over time."", 'But what does this contract mean for SNC and its future as a defense contractor?', ""As I pointed out last year, SNC recently raised $290 million in private investment for its space company subsidiary Sierra Space. The valuation on that capital raise implied that SNC's space division alone is now worth more than $5 billion -- making it one of the biggest space unicorn stocks on the planet. It also laid the groundwork for what could be a fabulously successful initial public offering, if Sierra Space succeeds in launching its Dream Chaser spaceplane to the International Space Station later this year, and SNC then follows through on its plans to IPO the subsidiary in 2025."", ""All of that, however, was before Sierra Space's parent company landed one of the biggest defense contracts in recent memory, and beat out one of the nation's biggest defense contractors in the process. Now I kind of have to wonder if Sierra Nevada Corporation should be considering an initial public offering!"", ""Mind you, to date there's been no indication whatsoever that SNC's husband-and-wife owners, Fatih and Eren Ozmen (respectively the CEO and chairwoman of the company) are interested in selling, or in sharing ownership with a bunch of individual investors. But the thought must be crossing their minds right about now."", 'In 2022, SNC was reported to have annual revenue of $2.2 billion. The AACP contract, by adding $13.1 billion across 12 years, probably raises that annual revenue number by nearly 50% -- a big jump that would be guaranteed to attract interest in any IPO they might contemplate.', 'If SNC\'s owners are interested in doing an IPO, all I can say is that the iron is looking awfully hot at this point. If they\'re going to ""strike,"" then now\'s the time to do it -- while excitement over the AACP contract is high, and before anyone gets around to wondering: If Boeing didn\'t think it could earn a profit on this contract, what\'s the chance that SNC might end up losing money on it as well?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

The problem is that many of the other businesspeople racing into Georgia do too.', 'Thomson heads marketing and product management at DC Blox, which in recent years built a string of data centers in midsize cities across the fast-growing Southeast. The company more recently set its sights on Atlanta—the would-be capital of the region—joining a slew of tech and industrial firms piling into the state.', 'There’s Not Enough Power for America’s High-Tech Ambitions', 'Stubbornly High Rents Prevent Fed From Finishing Inflation Fight', 'Chicken Wings Are the New Inflation Hedge', 'How Television Advertising Lost Its Relevance', 'Wealth Managers, Charities Defend Fees From Donor-Advised Funds', 'Vying for a piece of one of America’s hottest markets, those businesses tend to have two things in common. One is that they represent a U.S. economy increasingly driven by advanced manufacturing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The other is that they promise to hoover up huge amounts of electricity.', 'That combination means Georgia’s success in luring this development comes with a side effect: Power is a big source of tension. The clean-energy goals of companies and governments are running up against the need for projects to break ground fast. So far, climate advocates fear the imperatives of growth mean more fossil fuels.', 'Georgia’s main utility, Georgia Power, has boosted its demand projections sixteen-fold and is pushing ahead on a hotly contested plan to burn more natural gas. Critics warn it will yield higher bills and unnecessary carbon emissions for decades. Some companies are scrambling to secure bespoke renewable-energy deals to power their development.', 'One major source of disruption is data centers. The facilities are ballooning in size as people spend more of their waking hours online and companies digitize everything from factory processes to fast-food drive-throughs. All that computing requires power—and for firms like DC Blox to lock it in as quickly as possible.', '“Generally,” Thomson said, “we find the guys with the fastest power win.”', 'Similar quandaries are rippling through other hubs of the new American economy, with utilities in Tennessee and the Carolinas forecasting their own unexpected surges in load growth. U.S. power usage is projected to expand by 4.7% over the next five years, according to a review of federal fillings by the consulting firm Grid Strategies. That is up from a previous estimate of 2.6%.', 'The projections come after efficiency gains kept electricity demand roughly flat over the past 15 years, allowing the power sector to limit emissions in large part through coal-plant closures.', '“We haven’t seen this in a generation,” said Arne Olson, a senior partner at consulting firm Energy and Environmental Economics. “As an industry, we’ve almost forgotten how to deal with load growth of this magnitude.”', 'For states like Georgia, the fear is missing out on what could be once-in-a-generation investments. Wall Street is salivating over an artificial-intelligence-fueled tech bonanza, while Washington is throwing billions of dollars into domestic manufacturing.', 'The added wrinkle is that it is all happening as many parts of America—corporate America included—are trying to wean themselves off fossil fuels.', '“These companies all have clean-energy goals,” said Patty Durand, a Georgia Power critic who is campaigning to be a utility regulator in the state. “Those goals are at risk if Georgia Power gets what it wants.”', 'The Peach State’s energy quandary stems from the type of economic dynamism that many counterparts would envy. Its growth has consistently outpaced the nation’s. A smaller portion of Georgians are jobless than the U.S. average, while their incomes tend to be rising faster.', 'State and local economic-development teams have courted large businesses to set up shop with sales pitches that have included generous financial incentives. Rail lines, ports and America’s largest air hub also provide access to faraway customers.', 'Pat Wilson, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said energy is increasingly part of those discussions with newcomers. Officials tout the newly expanded Plant Vogtle, America’s largest nuclear power plant, as a sign the state is ready for long-term growth.', '“We have a utility partner to make sure you can meet your energy needs on day one,” Wilson said.', 'Those needs include affordability, reliability and sustainability for firms like Aurubis, a German metals giant building a recycling plant in the outskirts of Augusta.', 'U.S. energy prices are far lower than those in Europe. That is a boon for Aurubis, which uses mammoth equipment to shred old circuit boards and electrical wiring, melt the scraps, and separate copper from other materials.', 'The company also boasts aggressive emissions-reductions targets for its power-intensive smelters. At its roughly $820 million Georgia plant, Aurubis will use up to 31 megawatts of electricity, enough to power thousands of homes.', '“Not every project itself has to reduce carbon emissions,” said David Schultheis, president of the Georgia facility. “But the overall set of projects has to guide us there.”', 'The firm has made strides to that end in Europe by bolstering its usage of wind or solar power in a portfolio stretching from Belgium to Bulgaria. In Georgia, Schultheis pointed to Plant Vogtle, visible just 12 miles away, as a symbol of reliable energy.', 'Companies prize nuclear power plants, since they produce carbon-free energy and—unlike wind or solar power—don’t depend on the weather. But the projected power needs of new businesses in the state far exceed the expected output of the plant’s recently added reactors, the second of which went online last month.', 'Despite Aurubis’ proximity to Vogtle, which is co-owned by Georgia Power, it is also difficult to trace the source of electricity that reaches the substation on the German company’s property nearby. Schultheis instead relies on the utility’s overall power production for his carbon accounting, meaning the Georgia site will add more to Aurubis’ carbon footprint.', '“We get the full grid—the mix of the grid—of what they produce,” he said.', 'Many of the battles over that energy mix have been fought in a windowless room in one of the imposing government buildings crammed into Atlanta’s South Downtown area. That is home to meetings of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which oversees utilities including Georgia Power.', 'The investor-owned utility last fall made an unusual update to its periodic resource proposal to regulators. Citing a boom in new business customers, Georgia Power boosted its projected demand growth over the next seven years from less than 400 megawatts to 6,600 megawatts, or about a third more than the utility’s total capacity at the beginning of 2023.', 'To make up the gap, the company put forward a plan that includes adding battery storage, buying power from fossil-fuel-burning plants in Mississippi and Florida, and building three new gas-fired turbines in Georgia.', 'The Southern Co.subsidiary has since sparred with renewable-energy-minded organizations as divergent as local municipal governments, the Sierra Club and the Pentagon.', 'Opponents argued the utility should accelerate demand-side responses, such as allowing customers to dial down energy usage depending on costs. Others proposed more-aggressive use of solar power and batteries, or so-called “virtual power plants” that allow consumers with solar panels to sell energy back to the grid.', 'In Georgia Power’s view, adding gas is key to providing stable power and quickly ramping up electricity for moments of peak usage on the hottest days of summer and coldest days of winter. That is especially crucial given the utility’s gradual retirement of coal-fired plants.', 'The state is attracting so many power users, Georgia Power contends, that new investments will actually suppress ratepayers’ bills.', '“We anticipate that we will not need to increase rates to cover the costs of these resources that we’re adding,” said Aaron Mitchell, the company’s vice president of pricing and planning.', 'Some Georgians are skeptical, noting utilities’ previous overestimates of demand growth. Power companies have a financial incentive to pursue capital projects, critics say, and overbuilding now would risk saddling ratepayers with assets that have decadeslong shelf lives.', 'The recent history of energy development in the state has also been rocky. The Georgia Power-led project to expand Plant Vogtle, the first U.S. nuclear development in decades, ran up more than $30 billion in costs and lagged years behind schedule.', 'Since the project’s early stages in 2007, the 12-month moving average of residential power costs for the utility’s customers has surged 68%, according to the Georgia Center for Energy Solutions. That outpaced inflation, as well as cost increases for industrial and commercial customers.', 'Price pressures and climate fears have pushed communities such as suburban Atlanta’s DeKalb County, which has pledged to slash emissions, to lobby regulators for more aggressive oversight of the investor-owned utility. Ted Terry, a DeKalb County commissioner, warned that the state is using a 20th-century energy playbook while trying to attract 21st-century industries.', 'The state’s energy market “is not working for all of us,” Terry said. Regulators approved much of Georgia Power’s plan on April 16.', '‘Essential to our economy’', 'The tension hasn’t slowed businesses’ rush to the state.', 'Alphabet’s Google has operated data centers in Georgia for more than two decades, gradually expanding its footprint. In 2021, Microsoft established a new U.S. data-center region emanating from greater Atlanta. An Amazon Web Services spokesman said the firm recently bought land in the Peach State and is evaluating possible server-farm locations.', 'All three firms purchase massive amounts of renewable energy to help power their facilities around the world. All three are also members of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group pushing utilities, including Georgia Power, to go green.', 'Priya Barua, the organization’s senior director of market and policy innovation, said the added difficulty in much of the Southeast is that traditionally regulated power markets sometimes give firms fewer opportunities to shop around for wholesale electricity.', '“They’re more limited in how they can get clean energy,” she said.', 'Some analysts believe that could change as companies exert more pressure on regulators and developers strike deals with independent power producers. As part of Georgia Power’s recent planning update, the utility said it would work with trade groups like Barua’s to explore how commercial and industrial customers might build or contract their own clean-energy projects in the future.', 'Those setups have been confined in recent years to nonprofit electricity cooperatives that tend to serve rural areas. Instagram-owner Meta, for example, joined with a Georgia co-op and solar developer Silicon Ranch as part of a broader deal to power data centers.', 'But even in a more-competitive market, those deals may remain out of reach for most companies, such as DC Blox, the data-center operator building two facilities on opposing outskirts of Atlanta.', 'Founded in 2014, the firm constructed its first data center in an old paper plant in Chattanooga. Power usage: one megawatt. DC Blox has since built out a network from Myrtle Beach, S.C., to Huntsville, Ala., leasing space to municipalities, universities and manufacturers.', 'Now, the company is big-game hunting for big-tech customers. The larger of its two Atlanta-area sites could reach up to 300 megawatts.', '“The smart states and smart utility commissions are going to figure out how to do this because this isn’t going to stop,” said Thomson, the DC Blox executive. “AI is coming next.”', 'DC Blox executives see themselves as part of Atlanta’s evolution from logistics center to the digital hub of the Southeast. Nowhere is that more apparent than west of the city in Douglas County, the most sought-after corner of the region’s data-center market.', 'Local officials including Chris Pumphrey, president of the public-private Elevate Douglas Economic Partnership, began seeking out data centers about a decade ago. While the facilities employ few full-time employees, operators and tenants pour property and sales taxes into public coffers. Another benefit to Douglas County was that the new industry reduced truck traffic to warehouses peppering the area.', '“At that period of time,” Pumphrey said, “there wasn’t this significant concern about energy.”', 'These days, Douglas County is home to current or forthcoming data centers by companies including Google, Microsoft, DC Blox, Flexential and Switch. As hundreds of construction workers etch the concrete structures into sides of hills like fortresses, Pumphrey is eagerly awaiting the payoff.', '“They’re essential to our economy,” Pumphrey said. As for the energy concerns, he added, “We have to figure something out.”', 'Write to David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com', 'Corrections & AmplificationsU.S. power usage is projected to expand by 4.7%\xa0over the next five years.

When excluding COVID-19 revenue, however, sales actually increased by 11%. This suggests that Pfizer's core business is still strong despite a slowdown in COVID-19 vaccine demand.

It practically invented the fintech sector, becoming the largest digital payments company with a huge brand presence and more members than the U.S. population.', ""However, after years of growth, PayPal has been struggling, and its stock is down 79% from its highs in 2021. Let's see what's happening at PayPal and where it could be a year from now."", 'PayPal has several products and services that target individuals and business clients. It works with merchants to process payments and offers a large collection of business solutions. Meanwhile, its personal accounts that used to offer peer-to-peer payments now offer a full suite of financial services.', ""There are a number of reasons PayPal is losing investor confidence. It's expanded into a supersized company, which can make it harder to steer. Cracks emerged, and other companies have filled the gaps and made them wider. PayPal has become vulnerable to this type of competition, and not sensing the shifting trends in its industry has made it appear outdated."", ""Profitability has also been sagging. It has pushed some of its lower-margin products to generate sales, like Braintree, which is a white-label service where clients use PayPal's platform without the PayPal branding, and Venmo, an ever-popular personal app."", ""Faced with all these challenges, management brought in a new CEO, Alex Chriss, last September. He's made some important changes to the company's trajectory to boost profitability and create a clear and compelling growth story."", ""A few themes emerged from Chriss' update on the first-quarter earnings call. One of them was the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to leverage PayPal's huge data trove and create more value for clients and expand its opportunities. No surprises there, but it's a welcome shift."", ""Since PayPal reaches a mass market instead of a niche one, it's priced its products attractively. But that's been weighing on the bottom line. One term that came up a lot in the first-quarter earnings call is pricing to value, and management is righting its payment structure to price according to the value it provides. That should lead to higher profits and also improve its brand position, which Chriss admitted had lost some of its luster among certain markets."", ""The company is also focused on convincing its top merchants that PayPal's value-added services are worth their prices. Part of PayPal's value proposition is that, as the largest player with the broadest assortment of services, it can supercharge a merchant's business with many tools and solutions. That can lead to higher conversions and sales for clients as well as other benefits. One example is its complete payments solution, which can drive value for smaller businesses that need complete packages. Chriss sees this as a differentiating factor and competitive edge for PayPal."", ""Let's be clear about a few things. PayPal has an incredible name and a huge base of members, and it operates in a high-growth industry. It has enviable assets and tons of potential. It's nowhere near game over, and if management can successfully regroup and leverage its brand and assets, there's every possibility that it can continue to grow and reward shareholders. So far, it's going well."", ""In this year's first quarter, revenue increased 9% year over year, beating expectations, and total payment volume was up 14%. Total active members decreased 1% year over year, but they increased sequentially after dropping sequentially every quarter in 2023. Transactions per active account continue to increase, reaching a high of 60 in the first quarter. Profitability was strong as well, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up from $0.85 last year to $1.08 this year."", 'In a year from now, what investors will want to see is steady sales growth, increasing profitability, and strong innovation. Beyond that, they will want to see PayPal reporting a growing membership base and higher growth from products other than Venmo and Braintree.', 'PayPal has the tools and management needs to make them work. If you have some risk tolerance, now is a good time to pick up some shares, which are trading at under 17 times trailing 12-month earnings -- about their cheapest ever. But most investors should wait for sustained improvement.', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PayPal wasn’t one of them.

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and Amazon AMZN.', 'Walmart shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target and Home Depot.', 'From the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%.', 'Walmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.', 'Walmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd.', 'Walmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th.', 'Target shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop.', 'With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.', 'The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +54.5% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 57.1% beating revenue estimates.', 'The online players and restaurant operators have struggled to exceed EPS and revenue estimates in Q1. In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.', 'With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 21 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.', 'As noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.', 'We will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.', 'The bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 460 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 10th. We have almost 400 companies reporting results this week, including 7 S&P 500 members. In addition to Walmart and Home Depot, this week’s line-up includes Cisco Systems, Deere & Company, China’s Alibaba, JD.com, and many others.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 460 index members are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.', 'The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context.', 'Earnings growth for these companies would have been +7.9% instead of +4.8% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.', 'As we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.', 'Looking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.', 'As you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -1%, while the growth pace improves to +8.9% on an ex-energy basis.', 'For the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9.2% on +4.5% higher revenues.', 'Looking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.5% revenue growth.', 'For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Growth Poised to Accelerate ', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

107,a1ca153d-4f6c-3611-884c-f2b255d3bae7,ISRG,2024-05-13,7 Timeless Value Stocks to Build Wealth Like Warren Buffett,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-timeless-value-stocks-build-110000970.html,1715079600,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'ISRG', 'SIRI', 'TITN', 'LAC']","['Finding value stocks to buy — especially if you’re trying to emulate Warren Buffett — isn’t nearly as easy as copying trades from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). Something many amateur Buffett aficionados overlook is that, when it comes to finding value stocks to buy, Warren Buffett’s choices are surprisingly slim.', 'With billions in cash, Buffett faces a two-pronged dilemma. First, the company or stock he invests in must be liquid and large enough to handle massive purchase orders without unduly influencing the stock itself. Likewise, any investment’s projected returns must be significantly higher for the risk assumed than most retail investors realize, considering higher rates today mean that he can collect 5% or more risk-free on those billions.', 'These fairly rigid guiding principles mean Buffett is cut off from some of the most lucrative value investment sectors today: small-caps and micro-cap value stocks. Deploying his cash into any of them would send per-share pricing flying at the quantity he’d need to make it worth buying. That’s why you’ll never see Buffett buying value stocks below $10 billion in market capitalization.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'But luckily, those rules don’t apply to you. Instead, buying these value stocks could set you up to be the next Warren Buffett, considering each has significant upside potential that often goes overlooked. While not all of them are small-caps, together they represent a solid blend of value stock sectors, types and sizes to round out a portfolio.', 'Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is on the higher side of the value stock market cap spectrum. It’s also unique in that it blends value and growth through merging advanced technology, robotics, and the constant evolution of healthcare. A stable provider of high-end, specialized medical equipment, Intuitive Surgical is a component stock in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indices. Unlike competitors focused on traditional medical hardware, Intuitive Surgical revolutionizes surgical procedures, enhancing both provider efficiency and patient outcomes.', 'The company has been expanding aggressively globally, especially as the global healthcare sector rebounds and adapts to post-pandemic rhythms. Its latest quarterly earnings report showed a 16% year-over-year (YoY) increase in its robotic surgery system global usage and a 14% rise in new system installations. With an 11% increase in sales and net income rising to $545 million from $355 million, Intuitive Surgical solidifies its standing as a top MedTech stock for long-term investment.', 'This year, Intuitive Surgical is poised to introduce a next-generation da Vinci platform, as CEO Gary Guthart announced. The new model will boast “10,000 times the processing power” of current models, significantly enhancing data analysis, sensing technology and digital and analytical capabilities.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Small-cap agriculture and construction equipment value stocks like Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) might not enjoy the same level of recognition as larger counterparts, such as Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), but its robust fundamentals speak volumes. Titan Machinery recently released its fourth quarter and year-end reports, surpassing expectations with a 25% annual sales increase and nearly a 10% rise in yearly earnings despite rising supply chain and fuel costs.', 'Yet, no matter these strong fundamentals, Titan Machinery appears significantly undervalued, trading at just 0.19x sales, 4.6x earnings and 0.80x book value. That undervaluation seems particularly stark given the company’s 79% income growth over three years. With a conservative outlook for 2025, projecting single-digit gains across its segments and a slight dip in year-end earnings, surpassing these modest forecasts could lead to a surge in Titan’s stock value. At current prices, this small-cap value stock is an easy buy.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'Growth stock investor Cathie Wood includes Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) in several funds, but that doesn’t detract from its underlying value stock status. Despite a 50% drop over the past year, this decline offers an ideal buying opportunity for those interested in adding this small-cap value stock to their portfolios.', 'The stock’s recent downturn stemmed primarily from Iridium’s November 2023 decision to terminate its joint venture with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The original plan was to leverage Qualcomm’s expertise in cell-centric semiconductors to develop chips enabling standard cell phones to connect to Iridium’s low-earth orbit satellite array. However, ending this partnership appeared to sideline Iridium in the fast-evolving space-based telecom market.', 'Nevertheless, Iridium is intensifying its efforts to meld its satellite constellations with consumer smartphones. The strategic shift could enhance the stock’s value, establishing Iridium as a more prominent player in the specialized telecom industry. Rather than adapting cell phones to match their satellite capabilities, Iridium is modifying its satellite protocols to accommodate existing devices. That strategy should expand Iridium’s total addressable market, paving the way for further growth for this space-focused value stock.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'SharkNinja (NYSE:SN), a diverse appliance manufacturer across multiple consumer segments, including ice cream makers and vacuums, is a unique consumer discretionary value play despite going overlooked by most investors. Since its market debut during the difficult summer of last year, SharkNinja’s stock outperformed most, climbing 130% post-listing in under a year, even outstripping the S&P 500’s end-of-year bull run.', 'The company’s appeal lies not just in its short-term market resilience but also in its robust operational fundamentals, which promise substantial growth. The company has maintained a 20% annual increase in sales since 2008, with no slowdown anticipated soon.', 'Investors eyeing SharkNinja should consider buying in before its May 9th earnings report. Following subdued annual guidance after the fourth-quarter report, which projected fairly flat sales for the early part of 2024, even a slight revenue increase could propel the stock upward.', 'Source: Peshkova / Shutterstock', 'Garrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) is a dual-pronged value stock, trading at low multiples — just 8x forward earnings and 0.5x sales — and operating as an overlooked player in the increasingly unloved green tech and sustainable driving sectors. This industrial manufacturer produces various automotive parts that enhance emission reduction and support zero-emission technology, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.', 'While pure-EV companies face challenges due to dwindling consumer interest, as demonstrated by the surge in hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales compared to electric counterparts, Garrett Motion offers a viable alternative for investors keen on sustainability but realistic about the slow pace of global EV adoption.', 'The recent dip in Garrett Motion’s stock followed a lackluster earnings report that noted a 6% quarterly sales drop. However, annual sales remained stable, and the company’s margins and free cash flow stayed robust. This value stock suffers from a market fixation on flashy growth opportunities. But, as economic dynamics shift away from mega-caps currently dominating market trends, small-cap value stocks like Garrett Motion will begin gaining traction.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Of course, using Warren Buffett’s value stocks as inspiration doesn’t mean you can’t dip into the same well. A Warren Buffett endorsement remains a strong signal for those scouting for dependable value stocks, and recently, he has been actively buying Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI). Despite a general trend of selling rather than buying at Berkshire Hathaway, Sirius XM remains an exception.', 'Buffett values Sirius XM for potential corporate restructuring and as a robust value investment. Trading at low multiples, Sirius XM boasts steady, reliable sales. The company has consistently maintained EBITDA margins of around 30% for the last four years and has generated over $1 billion in free cash flow during this period. Additionally, Sirius XM offers an attractive 3.46% dividend yield with a 33% payout ratio, showcasing efficient cash management and supporting reinvestment alongside growth.', 'With Sirius XM’s price nearing penny stock levels, investors looking for a turnaround have a prime opportunity to build a significant position at a low cost.', 'Source: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com', 'One of Buffett’s least favorite value stock prospects is anything dealing in commodities. But Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAAC) is an easy exception to the rule, considering its current valuation and market potential. That’s despite the recently sluggish lithium market. The demand for lithium, driven primarily by advances in battery technology and shifts towards renewable energy, is projected to surge more than 30% annually through 2030. Over the past year, though, Lithium Americas encountered slow demand and a massive oversupply, which depressed spot prices. But demand is accelerating, and analysts are now predicting an undersupply that could elevate spot prices, benefiting Lithium Americas.', 'Adding to this optimistic outlook, Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei, has been a bullish influence on the region’s lithium mining prospects, aiming to reduce operational barriers. His discussions with Elon Musk underscore lithium’s pivotal role in electric vehicle production, further encouraging regional investors.', 'With the stock trading below its book value and at a lower price-to-forward earnings ratio than in recent years, Lithium Americas is positioned as an attractive commodity-centric value stock, ready to capitalize on the anticipated market adjustments and economic developments.', 'On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

This means that the annual payment will be 1.4% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for CSX ', 'We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before making this announcement, CSX was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 31.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.20 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.48. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.1% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that CSX has been growing its earnings per share at 6.2% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting."", ""In summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for CSX that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

It pays to pay attention to what he is buying.', 'There are four Buffett stocks in particular that investors should dive deeper into right now.', 'Few stocks have outperformed Visa (NYSE: V) or Mastercard (NYSE: MA) since they went public. Over the past decade alone, both stocks have more than quadrupled in value. The S&P 500, in comparison, rose by just 234% over the same time period.', 'What has made Visa and Mastercard shares so special? The same factors make both stocks a buy today. Namely, they operate high-quality businesses that benefit from network effects. That is, the larger these businesses become, the more powerful they get.', ""Right now, when it comes to credit cards and debit cards, Visa has a 61% market share in the U.S. Mastercard, meanwhile, has the second largest market share with around 25%. Just four companies control nearly 100% of the U.S. market, with fourth place coming in with just a 2% market share. In other words, this is a highly consolidated market. That's thanks to network effects."", ""Visa and Mastercard have been around for decades. They've established trust and reputation among regulatory agencies, security analysts, merchants, and everyday consumers. This trust makes merchants more willing to accept payments on both networks. It also attracts more customers, which attracts yet more merchants since these parties want to accept what the customer can pay with. It's a positive feedback loop, one that has led to natural market consolidation."", ""Visa and Mastercard have greatly benefited from their duopoly market positions. Profit margins for both companies are around 50% -- a significant rise from 2010 levels of roughly 30%. This rise in profitability shouldn't be surprising. After all, businesses that benefit from network effects tend to grow stronger as they scale. And since both businesses are asset-light, greater scale means greater profitability."", ""As with any high-quality business, both stocks are expensive. Visa currently trades at 31 times earnings, while Mastercard trades at 36 times earnings. But with the S&P 500 as a whole trading at 27 times earnings, that's not a steep premium to pay for two of the most profitable stocks in Buffett's portfolio."", 'Buffett is a big fan of bank stocks. Berkshire owns several in its portfolio. Two of these bank stocks are near opposites in many ways, yet both are buys.', ""The first bank stock to know about in Berkshire's portfolio is Citigroup (NYSE: C). The position is worth roughly $3 billion and has been in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2022. Back then, the share price was around $60 -- very close to where shares are valued today. If you want to piggyback on a Buffett stock, this is your chance."", 'Why is Berkshire betting $3 billion on Citigroup? The biggest factor may be valuation. Citigroup stock trades at a 40% discount to book value. That is, the market believes the company to be worth 40% less than the listed accounting value of its assets. In comparison, Bank of America -- another Buffett stock -- trades at a 16% premium to book value. Citigroup has posted poorer returns on capital, but if its management team manages a comeback, expect the book value discount to narrow quickly.', ""Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) is another promising bank stock in Berkshire's portfolio. Nu was created to take Latin America's banking industry by storm. It was one of the first banks to take a digital-first approach, offering its services to anyone with a smartphone. In its first decade of operations, the business went from zero customers to over 90 million. More than half of all Brazilian adults are now Nu customers."", ""Nu isn't a value stock like Citigroup. Shares trade at 8.9 times book value. But with a market cap of only $57 billion, it's not hard to see how Nu could double or triple in size this decade merely by tapping its existing markets. Entering new countries in Latin America, meanwhile, could add even more growth potential. High multiple stocks like this can be volatile, but Berkshire has maintained its $900 million stake since 2021 without selling a single share. Patient investors looking for maximum long-term growth should consider joining in."", 'Before you buy stock in Citigroup, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Citigroup wasn’t one of them.

According to S&P Global, ""Geopolitics, rising government bond yields, inflation and monetary policy concerns are behind the recent drops, yet stocks may still have room to rise again.""', ""After the drop, three iconic dividend stocks now pay huge yields between 6.5% and 9%. If you're looking for big dividends, this is your chance."", 'Altria Group (NYSE: MO) has long been a high-paying dividend stock. Over the last five years, the dividend yield has always remained above 6%. Due to some recent share price weakness, the dividend yield is now around 9%. This is a great opportunity to buy into a recession-resistant business with high levels of free cash flow.', ""At its core, Altria is a tobacco business. It owns a portfolio of recognizable brands including Marlboro, Copenhagen, Skoal, Red Seal, Benson & Hedges, Chesterfield, NJOY, and Black & Mild. This is a market that varies little year to year, even during recessions. The mix of products may shift -- combustibles, for example, have slowly ceded share to vaporized nicotine -- but overall nicotine use has remained stable. Altria's reputation, market access, and capital advantages have allowed it to compete wherever its core market heads."", ""Just because the nicotine market is stable doesn't mean it's growing. From 2018 to 2023, for instance, nicotine usage rose by just 1%. That's the reason Altria pays such a large dividend. This stock will never make you rich overnight, but it's proven a reliable way to generate consistent dividend income over the long term. That equation won't change much in the years to come."", 'The telecom industry has long paid above-average dividends. These businesses can be expensive to establish at first, but once up and running, they typically generate high levels of free cash flow. AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ), for example, now pay dividends of 6.5% and 6.7% respectively. Before you jump in, however, there are a few things you should know.', ""As you can see in the charts above, both AT&T and Verizon have consistently paid high dividends, although Verizon's yield in particular has picked up strongly in recent years. The impetus behind these high yields, however, wasn't a dramatically higher payout. What's changed is that the share prices for both companies has gradually fallen, artificially inflating the dividend yield."", 'You can see this dynamic in action by looking at each companies total return over the past decade. These returns factor in both share price movement and dividends. Since 2014, Verizon and AT&T have both posted total returns of around 35%. The S&P 500, for comparison, rose in value by 234%.', 'AT&T and Verizon both face their own difficulties, but the root challenge has been competition, which has eroded pricing power and increased operational costs. AT&T actually had to cut its dividend in 2022 after the spinoff of its media division, WarnerMedia. Verizon has been able to gradually raise its payout, but not by much. Last quarter, the company implemented a 2% boost to the payout.', ""If you're looking for a reliable, high-yield dividend stock, Altria Group is the better pick versus AT&T or Verizon. It's not that the latter two are poor businesses, but rising telecom competition won't abate anytime soon. And while Altria has faced competition of its own, its established supremacy in the combustibles market buys it time to innovate and control new market categories as they emerge."", 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Altria Group wasn’t one of them.

tit for tat that becomes problematic."", 'And, and there was a story today that China is looking to raise uh call about 100 and $40 billion worth of long bonds.', 'And one of the reasons they said that it is preemptively, uh, as a shield against the, the, the effect of potential tariffs.', ""Um, you know, at, at this point, uh, they're definitely, they're definitely thinking that this is a possibility and what's the risk to stocks, the risk of stocks which are trading at highs?"", ""Of course, of course, they're ignoring everything pretty much."", ""I'm sure you and I will get into that

down that inflation is under control."", 'And, you know, this is, this is where it becomes problematic.', 'Um because tariffs do eventually come out of the consumer.', 'Well, I, I think there was a good uh bit of research recently out of the Goldman Sachs team saying any new tariffs would I think decrease GDP by 1% and, and increase prices by 1%.', ""I mean, that's, that's a big hit."", 'No kidding.', ""And I, and I, again, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna pretend to, to debate what their economists have found."", ""I'm just not prepared to do that, but intuitively."", 'Yeah, that makes sense.', ""It's, it's, it's, it, it's, it's adding inefficiency um to an economy that desperately needs efficiency."", ""We can argue the politics of it whether it's better or not."", ""You know, that that's a debate maybe for, for different, for different people at another time."", ""But I don't disagree with Goldman's basic premise."", ""Even if I can't verify the numbers myself, then is it time for investors to pay more attention to the presidential election?"", 'Because you know, I get President Biden reportedly coming out with what might be targeted tariffs on China.', 'President Trump seems very aggressive.', 'Both of them are targeting China which is a key trading partner of ours.', 'But oh yes, you still have multinational companies like a Starbucks, a Tesla inside this country doing business.', ""How don't their multiples take a hit?"", ""I right now, I think they, they, I I don't know how they don't take ahead, but this is, but this is kind of the mystery of the stock market now."", ""Anyway, um you know, multiples, we've seen a lot of multiple expansion and this gets into one of my, one of my themes that I've been working on is is the question I've been asking is, does eps really matter?"", 'Does support?', 'Yes but no.', 'And this is this is the interesting problem, right?', ""So of course, nothing matters more to an investor than, than earnings per share and the associated measures cash flow uh revenues as a former analyst, you know, one of the, the one thing trying to ignore those days, I, I don't wanna compute models anymore, Steve, I appreciate what you're saying."", ""But the one thing you know is you can't fake cash flow."", ""That's true."", ""I mean, some try but, but ultimately, you know, ultimately, if you're not generating cash, you got problems."", ""Um and so th all those numbers are always very important, but the problem we have now is when you're in a situation where between 75 and 80% of the companies routinely beat their EPS estimates, investors are increasingly looking beyond dps."", 'And so it raises the question of, of how, think about how many companies have reported better than expected.', 'Eps and then got whacked anyway because they missed, they said they were pulling back a number uh on their future earnings releases.', 'I mean, that was a good quarter from Netflix Meta.', 'I mean, we, we can go down a list of Star Starbucks, I think did this.', 'We, we can go down the list of companies that had better than expected.', 'Ep Let me start on Starbucks.', ""Well, we don't have time for that, but I'll, I'll leave that one alone."", 'But then what happens is, but so, so investors are looking past it.', ""So, you know, because in my mind, the question I think has become, have management's gotten better at managing their bottom lines or have they gotten better at managing their look at all the stock buybacks."", ""I think they've gotten really good at buying back, being very aggressive on stock buybacks, but also playing the street, I think they just have got the street figured out."", 'That was literally the next part of my comment was, have they gotten better at managing their bottom line or have they gotten better at managing their analysts?', 'And I think they have gotten better at managing their analyst perceptions.', ""And so as a result, I if everybody's above average, then, then it does, then, then you've rendered the, you've rendered the average somewhat meaningless."", ""And I think that's what we're seeing."", 'I interestingly, I saw a statistic and I wish I could cite the source um basically two statistics, conflicting article but conflicting articles, basically one that analysts are raising their EPS estimates this quarter.', 'Despite the fact that only about 15% of the companies are actually gave positive guidance, increase their guidance.', ""Well, something's gotta give and I think maybe it's the analyst getting tired of, of just constantly missing numbers."", ""But if you're raising, uh if you're raising analyst estimates at the same time that the companies are not raising their guidance, something's gotta give at some point."", ""There's a, you know, let's just stay on EPS guidance."", ""I wasn't going to go there but I will um a lot of numbers in my head and I saw a good chart from the team over at Evercore, noting earnings per share for the other, for the 493 other companies in the S and P 500 that are those earnings are supposed to accelerate this year and next year by extension of the magnificent seven in Amazon Apple, you name it,

returning it to shareholders."", 'Yes, they raised their dividend.', 'Yes, the dividend is kind of still only about a half a percent.', ""It's pretty, pretty meager, but you're starting to see companies return more money to shareholders."", ""And I think that's a good thing and if a company pays a dividend as volatility increases, it gets, it gives it a little ballast."", ""And so I think

they, you know, they actually do a lot of the chip design."", 'Uh that for A I, I believe they actually do it for NVIDIA as well.', 'They beat, uh they beat their EPS because everybody beats their EPS.', 'Um They actually raised their short term guidance but modestly lowered their long term guidance in the stock.', 'Um, you know, originally went down 6 to 8%.', 'It ended up closing the day, I think between two and 3%.', ""But that's sort of the classic example."", ""Have, you know, have we out kicked the coverage and we'll know this because last quarter, NVIDIA went up about 16% after

pri the prior quarter, the stock beat on every metric and went down 2.5%.', 'So it does happen.', ""So if NVIDIA gives any signal that things are sort of not, you know, that's gonna break the cycle of beat raise, beat raise, which to be fair."", ""This company has been perhaps the best I've seen at this is still the most important stock in the stock market."", 'I believe it is.', ""I believe it's

mean?', 'For an NVIDIA?', ""At some point, at some point, you've invested the money in, in, in your A I development, you bought the chips, you're, you've, you've, you know, you've signed up whether

For Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of US equity trading strategy, the broader market is bracing for a move around CPI that’s in line with expectations on May 23 — the day after Nvidia Corp. delivers its latest earnings results.', 'The CPI report will be closely watched by traders for signals as to how much the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates this year. That said, which part of CPI traders will focus on and how they will place bets in various scenarios are where the differences lie over how much the equities benchmark may swing, per Tyler.', '“The key risk is a hotter CPI print,” Tyler and his team wrote in a note to clients on Monday. For instance, if month-over-month core CPI tops 0.4%, that would likely spur a selloff across all risk assets, with the S&P 500 falling between 1.75% to 2.5% as investors find shelter in commodity plays, Tyler says.', 'But if core CPI comes in between 0.3% and 0.35% from the prior month — near JPMorgan and consensus forecasts — the S&P 500’s outcome ranges from a 0.5% loss to a 1% gain, depending on whether rent inflation remains elevated, Tyler added. Any outcome where the core month-over-month declines sequentially will be “read as a positive by the market,” especially if the figure comes in below 0.2%, which may even revive bets for a June rate cut and send the S&P 500 higher by 2% to 2.5%, he added.', 'A big swing around the CPI report comes as volatility across markets has been tamped down. The VIX Index measuring S&P volatility is near the year’s low, while volatility on VIX options — used to hedge against a big market selloff — last week fell to the lowest in nine years.', 'Those implied moves are larger swings than what’s expected following the government’s next jobs report, due on June 7, even after employers scaled back hiring in April, suggesting cooling in the labor market after a strong start to the year, according to Citigroup.', '“Inflation has been the bigger event for traders the past two years and still is,” Citigroup’s Kaiser said over the phone. “Despite a recent payrolls miss, any prints that show more than 150,000 jobs were created in a given month, investors will largely be comfortable with that because it still reflects a strong labor market. If job growth were to come in below that, the market will start to shift its focus toward hiring growth over inflation.”', 'Overall, the slide in volatility and lower premiums for puts has made broader stock market hedging more attractive, and some VIX call spread buying was seen last week and Monday.', '“The rise in interest rates that has pushed up SPX forwards increases call premiums relative to puts,” said Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “This has eased the entry for collar strategies that sell calls and buy puts. The decline in the SPX skew, which is close to the low of the last 10-year range, has also reduced the cost of this strategy.”', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits', 'Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges', '‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA', 'How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags', 'Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Specifically, we decided to study Walt Disney's  ROE in this article."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walt Disney is:', '2.8% = US$2.9b ÷ US$104b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.03 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""It is quite clear that Walt Disney's ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 14%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 26% seen by Walt Disney over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""That being said, we compared Walt Disney's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 25% in the same 5-year period."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.

You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. ', ""When we piece together Walt Disney's low three-year median payout ratio of 23% (where it is retaining 77% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""In addition, Walt Disney has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 15% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 10%, over the same period."", ""Overall, we have mixed feelings about Walt Disney. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth.

Furthermore, the company\'s streaming transformation in its content business has yet to prove itself.', ""Sure, management recently reinitiated a dividend, reflecting its confidence in a strategic restructuring and a reinvigorated focus on growth. But investors shouldn't automatically assume that management's confidence is a buy signal. Buying the entertainment stock at its current valuation may simply require too much speculation."", 'The first major problem at Disney is its anemic top-line growth. Total revenue in its most recent quarter (fiscal Q2) rose just 1% year over year.', ""Weighing heavily on its revenue performance was a 5% decline in entertainment revenue. The segment's 13% year-over-year growth in direct-to-consumer revenue wasn't enough to offset an 8% decline in linear networks revenue and a 40% drop in content sales, licensing, and other entertainment revenue."", ""Sports revenue, which includes the company's lucrative ESPN operation, rose just 2% during the quarter."", ""The experiences segment, which includes sales from its domestic and international parks and its consumer products, rose 10%. Key to this growth, however, was the temporary boon of the continued rebound of global travel as the COVID pandemic fades further into the rearview mirror. It wouldn't be surprising to see this growth slow down."", ""The hope Disney investors are likely clinging to is the company's direct-to-consumer business. Disney has finally shown that this subsegment, which is seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, can contribute to profitability. Direct-to-consumer, which includes revenue from streaming services services like Disney+, Hotstar, and Hulu, swung to profitability in fiscal Q2. And its operating income was $47 million, up from a loss of $587 million in the year-ago quarter."", ""While it's great to see improvement, it should be noted that this translates to an operating profit margin of less than 1%. Disney may need significantly more scale for this segment's operating margin to eventually rival the operating margin for its linear networks (traditional TV), which falls somewhere between 25% and 35% in most quarters."", ""If the direct-to-consumer business's revenue growth rate or operating margin expansion proves to be underwhelming, this catalyst could ultimately be a letdown."", ""The final reason to avoid the stock is the simplest. Given the quality of Disney's assets, from top-notch movie franchises to irreplaceable theme parks, investors shouldn't expect to buy shares on the cheap. But given the company's slow top-line growth and the uncertainty surrounding its streaming business, they shouldn't pay an expensive valuation multiple either. Trading at 24 times management's forecast for fiscal 2024 free cash flow, shares simply aren't reasonably priced."", 'Before pulling the trigger on shares, it may be wise to wait for either a bigger pullback in the stock price, or stronger top-line growth and more evidence of a catalyst for the stock from its nascent streaming business.

A few Fool.com contributors have highlighted some of their favorite income stocks. "", 'What they like about this particular trio, MPLX (NYSE: MPLX), Oneok\xa0(NYSE: OKE), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), is that they offer high dividend yields and are on track to grow their payouts. That combination of income and growth could enable these high-yield dividend stocks to generate high total returns in the coming years. ', ""Tyler Crowe (MPLX): Energy infrastructure has consistently been one of the highest-yielding industries for decades. Moving oil and gas is much more of a volume business than a commodity price business, which ensures steady cash flows. Also, many of the companies in this industry are structured as master limited partnerships, which makes each shareholder responsible for their portion of the partnership's taxable income. The business passes much of its cash flow to investors to cover their portion of taxes."", 'MPLX has emerged as one of the best in the energy infrastructure business. The company is a publicly traded subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, and it owns much of the oil and gas infrastructure that moves oil, gas, and refined products to and from Marathon refineries.', 'What makes MPLX stand out among its peers is its strong rates of return, capital discipline, and generous returns to shareholders. It has simultaneously generated some of the highest returns on invested capital while keeping its leverage (defined as debt to EBITDA) lower than most.', 'At the same time, its dividend growth has outpaced all of its competitors by a pretty wide margin.', ""Investors shouldn't expect huge increases in revenue or earnings. Oil and gas pipelines is a slow-growing business that generates lots of cash. Today, the stock has a forward dividend yield of 8.1%. There aren't many high-yield stocks out there that match what MPLX has to offer as a business or as a stock."", ""Jason Hall (Oneok): There are a few dividend growth stock lists that investors love -- namely, the ones that are companies that have increased their dividend every single year for multiple decades. And while I own a few of those stocks, I'm here to challenge the idea of consecutive dividend growth as being a must-have before a stock is buy-worthy. The recent tales of Walgreens and 3M are great examples of when dividend-growth-can't-stop becomes a detriment, and ends up harming shareholders."", ""This is a big reason I wanted to share Oneok as my pick for this topic. Since January of 2020, this midstream energy company has only increased its dividend twice. That's right -- just two increases in the past four years."", 'However, it also was able to navigate the Coronavirus pandemic without having to cut the payout. A boon for its shareholders, many of which may have been counting on that quarterly check to make ends meet.', ""Why is this notable? In short, because prior to the pandemic Oneok's management was able to raise the payout 11 times from 2015 through 2019, while still heading into one of the most challenging periods in the modern energy industry's history with a strong enough business and balance sheet to keep paying shareholders and operating its business."", ""Fast-forward to the post-pandemic period, and Oneok is back on a dividend growth cadence, after increasing its payout 2% in 2023 and 3.7% to start 2024. And while it hasn't been a market-beating stock over the past decade, it's been an income investor's dream, growing its payout 148%, and generating 156% in total returns, or almost 10% a year on average. With a yield near 4.9% at recent prices and a strong, cash-flowing business, Oneok deserves consideration from investors prioritizing a high-dependable yield, and a long-term track record of growth, but with a management team that puts the needs of the business ahead of raising the payout."", ""Matt DiLallo (Enbridge): Enbridge is approaching another milestone. This year should be the Canadian pipeline and utility company's 30th in a row of increasing its dividend. That's an impressive streak, considering the energy market's volatility. "", 'The company built its business to generate very stable cash flow. Enbridge pays 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow to investors in dividends. It retains the rest to help fund expansion projects. That approach provides investors with stable returns while allowing it to continue growing. ', ""Enbridge currently has a massive backlog of expansion projects. It ended the first quarter with $25 billion Canadian ($18.3 billion) of commercially secured growth projects. That backlog gives it lots of visibility into its future earnings growth. It supports the company's view that it can increase its adjusted EBITDA by around 3% annually through 2028. On top of that, Enbridge expects to deliver another 1% to 2% in annual earnings growth from optimizations and cost savings. "", 'The company has the financial capacity to fund its growth with room to spare. This financial flexibility will allow it to sanction additional projects, make bolt-on acquisitions, and opportunistically repurchase shares. Those upside catalysts support its view that it should deliver 5% annual earnings growth over the next several years. ', 'That should give Enbridge plenty of fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend, which currently stands at over 7%. Combined with its growing earnings, Enbridge could have the power to continue producing double-digit average annual total returns, consistent with its long-term track record of growing shareholder value.

""They simply pivoted too late.""', 'The fragmenting of the video landscape is well understood -- and media companies like NBCUniversal have developed new advertising tools that let marketers\' messages ride along with their content, wherever it appears. For example, a T-Mobile ad featuring U.S. TV show ""Saturday Night Live\'s"" Chloe Fineman could air during the live network TV broadcast of “SNL,” appear the next day on NBCU’s Peacock streaming service and show up on social platforms like X, TikTok and YouTube.', ""“Regardless of where that person is who's in your target … you can go follow them, wherever they are,” NBCUniversal global advertising chairman Mark Marshall told Reuters. “The technology and capability just wasn't available until this year.”"", 'Ahead of the upfront advertiser presentations, Disney and Warner Bros Discovery announced they would combine their Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming services this summer in a bundle of programming reminiscent of cable television. Such a combination might reduce subscriber cancellations and perhaps coax money-losing competitors to follow suit, analysts said.', '“We view a re-bundling of traditional media content on streaming platforms as a key to making the space investable again,” wrote TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz.', 'Meanwhile, digital rivals Amazon and Netflix are hosting their own advertiser presentations in New York -- the Seattle retail giant, for the first time -- to capture shifting ad dollars.', ""Amazon launched ads within Prime Video for all customers in January, requiring users to pay for a higher-priced tier to remove ads. The move will boost Amazon's revenue and likely come at the expense of traditional TV companies' revenue, said Brian Wieser, a longtime ad industry analyst, in a March report."", ""Media companies are also tying up with tech giants to sell more ads. During a presentation to advertisers last month, Google announced that brands would be able to buy ad space with media companies like Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery through Google's automated tech tools, rather than working with salespeople."", '""I think we\'re going to hear more about programmatic ... particularly as consumption shifts to the digital and streaming ecosystem,” said Samantha Rose, strategic investment lead at Horizon Media, referring to the upfront presentations.', '(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, Sheila Dang in Austin; Edited by Kenneth Li in New York)']"

So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$50.12. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern."", 'The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

In that time, Executive Vice President of Human Resources & Administration Tana Cashion dumped US$1.0m worth of shares. Meanwhile President Richard Muncrief bought US$666k worth , as we said above . Generally this level of net selling might be considered a bit bearish.', ""Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Devon Energy insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$217m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""The stark truth for Devon Energy is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

A little over week ago, Berkshire lured in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to Omaha, Nebraska, for its latest annual gathering."", 'People flock to this annual meeting to listen to the ""Oracle of Omaha"" speak about his investing philosophy, the U.S. economy, and select stocks held by Berkshire.', 'While these annual meetings consistently offer a cheery tone and speak to Warren Buffett\'s and the late Charlie Munger\'s long-term investing ethos, Berkshire Hathaway\'s 2024 meeting was overshadowed by a very large number that offers a subtle warning Wall Street would be foolish (with a small ""f"") to ignore.', ""Although we won't get a precise look at Berkshire Hathaway's more than $360 billion investment portfolio until the company files its Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission this Wednesday, May 15, the company's operating results speak volumes about what Buffett and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been up to."", 'During the March-ended quarter, the Oracle of Omaha and his team sold close to $20 billion in equity securities while purchasing less than $2.7 billion. This marked the sixth consecutive quarter that Berkshire Hathaway was a net-seller of stocks. All told, net-selling activity has reached $56 billion since Oct. 1, 2022.', ""A significant percentage of the close to $20 billion in equity security sales during the first quarter relates to the disposal of around 115 million shares of tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is still far-and-away the largest holding in Berkshire's investment portfolio."", ""During his annual Q&A with investors, Warren Buffett suggested that tax reasons were behind the hefty reduction in its Apple stake. The Oracle noted that while the peak marginal corporate income tax rate is currently 21%, fiscal policy changes are liable to increase this figure in the future. Locking in gains at a lower tax rate is something that he believes Berkshire's shareholders will come to appreciate."", ""However, the bigger story is that Berkshire's cash pile, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills, surged to $189 billion, as of the end of March, from $167.6 billion to close out 2023. In fact, Warren Buffett opined during the annual shareholder meeting that his company's war chest could hit the psychological $200 billion mark when the current quarter ends."", ""Having a lot of capital on hand is normally viewed as a positive by Wall Street and investors. But that's not the case for an investing great like Warren Buffett, who for nearly six decades has run circles around Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index by putting his company's cash to work via investments and acquisitions -- Berkshire owns approximately five dozen businesses, including railroad BNSF and insurer GEICO."", ""During Berkshire's annual meetings, as well as in Buffett's annual letter to shareholders, the Oracle almost always strikes a positive tone on the U.S. economy and long-term investing. However, Berkshire's ongoing cash build makes it plainly evident that Buffett and his team aren't seeing much in the way of value."", 'Berkshire Hathaway\'s greatest investment minds are focused on buying stakes in wonderful companies at a ""fair"" price. At the moment, the S&P 500 is exceptionally pricey.', ""When the closing bell rang on May 7, the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio) clocked in at 33.95. The Shiller P/E ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years, which means it smooths out the impact of one-off events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, over time."", 'Not only is the current reading nearly double the average multiple for this valuation tool when back-tested to 1871, but it marks the third-highest readout during a bull market. in plainer terms, stocks are really pricey right now.', 'The five previous instances where the Shiller P/E ratio surpassed 30 during a bull market eventually resulted in the S&P 500 and/or Dow Jones Industrial Average losing between 20% and 89% of their value. We may not know ahead of time when these downturns will take shape, but a Shiller P/E ratio surpassing 30 has historically been a clear warning sign that a correction awaits Wall Street.', ""Perhaps not coincidentally, we also witnessed Berkshire's cash hoard substantially grow just prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the housing crisis in 2007, and the bear market of 2022."", ""In addition to Warren Buffett subtly warning with his company's growing cash pile that the stock market may be trading at an irrational valuation, we've witnessed the first notable drop in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression. All signs would appear to point to downside in the U.S. economy and/or stock market in the not-too-distant future."", ""While this may not be what you want to hear as an investor, keep in mind that this isn't Warren Buffett's first rodeo. He's successfully steered Berkshire Hathaway through a number of recessions, geopolitical concerns, and stock market corrections/bear markets during his nearly six decades at the helm. His company has emerged stronger following each and every one of these events."", ""It can be argued that Warren Buffett's greatest strength is putting his company's capital to work during periods of historic fear and uncertainty."", ""For instance, Buffett's company was instrumental in helping Bank of America rebuild confidence in its stock. Berkshire acquired $5 billion in BofA's preferred stock to shore up its capital reserves during the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis. This position, which also came with warrants to purchase up to 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock at $7.14, has made Berkshire a handsome profit."", 'Buffett, Combs, and Weschler also fully understand the difference between short-term instability and long-term expansion. Only three out of 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II reached the 12-month mark, and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months in duration. Comparatively, most periods of economic expansion have stuck around for multiple years, with two periods of growth topping 10 years.', ""It's official.

Ranked in order from largest to smallest, those companies are Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Saudi Arabian Oil, and Meta Platforms.', 'The obvious theme here is that most of these companies operate in the technology sector. Moreover, within technology, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon all share something else in common: Each of them is a dominant force in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).', ""Beyond mega-cap tech enterprises, I see another player quietly emerging at the intersection of cloud AI infrastructure. Let's break down how Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is making notable strides in AI, and analyze the company's path to a trillion-dollar valuation."", 'According to Statista, Amazon is the top cloud infrastructure provider with 31% market share as of the end of the first quarter this year. Microsoft and Alphabet round out the top three, with 25% and 11% market share, respectively. With just 2% market share, Oracle trails its big tech cohorts by a considerable margin.', ""However, Oracle's operating results over the last several quarters are quite impressive. For example, through the first nine months of Oracle's fiscal 2024, ended Feb. 29, the company's cloud services revenue grew 26% year over year to $14.5 billion. In the most recent quarter specifically, cloud services increased 25% year over year to $5 billion. By contrast, Amazon's cloud business grew 17% year over year in its most recent quarter."", 'Although Amazon is a much larger cloud operation, Oracle is currently growing at a faster pace. I think this demonstrates that cloud infrastructure, in general, is experiencing accelerated growth, and businesses are using platforms outside of the top three providers. These secular tailwinds should bode well for Oracle over the long run.', 'Outside of revenue, one of the most important metrics that Oracle reports is remaining performance obligations (RPO). RPO is important because it provides investors with a preview of revenue that has been booked but not yet recognized.', ""At the end of the most recent quarter, Oracle's RPO grew 29% year over year and reached an all-time high of $80 billion. Furthermore, during the earnings call, management told investors that roughly 43% of these RPOs will be recognized as revenue over the 12 months."", ""Considering Oracle's backlog is growing faster than its reported revenue, I think it's safe to say that demand for the company's cloud services is robust."", 'The chart below illustrates consensus analyst estimates for revenue and earnings per share (EPS) for Oracle over the next couple of years. While these metrics are expected to accelerate, the growth rates might appear somewhat muted compared to other software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.', ""One reason for this is that Oracle is experiencing declining growth in its on-premise business. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Oracle's on-premise cloud operation generated $3.2 billion in revenue -- a decrease of 11% annually."", 'While this may look like a blemish or even a risk, it actually makes some sense. As on-premise services continue migrating to the cloud, Oracle actually has an opportunity to transition this decelerating component of its business to a new growth leg.', ""Considering Oracle's position in the cloud market relative to larger players, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, the general consensus is that the company will take longer to scale, a view I'm aligned with."", ""Right now, Oracle's market cap is roughly $320 billion and the company trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just 6.3. It's easy to see that Oracle trades at a considerable discount to Microsoft specifically, and is trading modestly lower than Alphabet."", ""Considering the rate at which Oracle is growing, combined with its opportunity to turn its on-premise business into a major growth engine, I think there is a good argument to be made that the company's valuation could rise considerably over a long-term horizon -- possibly making the estimates above somewhat conservative."", ""In other words, as cloud database management continues to be an important pillar of the overall AI narrative and digital transformation efforts at the enterprise level, Oracle's valuation multiples should eventually see some notable expansion and the company could one day reach trillion-dollar status."", 'But what investors must realize is that this transition is going to take time.

We have talked about the highest paying industries in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paid Jobs and Occupations in the US.', 'The landscape of high-paying jobs in the US is largely dominated by tech and healthcare industries. In 2021, the average salary for technology professionals in the US increase to a record high of $104,566. Despite this increase, nearly half of tech workers expressed feeling underpaid. It is interesting to note that web developers experienced the most substantial pay raise, with salaries up by over 21.3%, while IT management positions commanded the highest average pay at $151,983.', ""The tech industry's highest-growth positions included database administrators, technical support engineers, and data analysts. As companies transition to the cloud, roles such as software developers are expected to continue seeing salary increases which also indicates ongoing demand for specific skill sets."", 'As long as the healthcare industry is concerned, healthcare jobs in the US have been a major contributor to job gains, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, the healthcare sector added 70,000 jobs, making up nearly 20% of the total additions to the American workforce. This increase in hiring has been attributed to a shift towards a more permanent workforce in healthcare facilities, as hospitals move away from relying heavily on temporary staff, such as contract nurses, which were in high demand during the peak of the pandemic.', 'It is also worth mentioning that healthcare remains one of the highest paying industries in the US. According to Salary.com, the average salary for a General Surgeon is $432,400, making it one of the highest-paying roles within the healthcare sector in the US. An Anesthesiologist follows closely with an average salary of $426,800, while a Medical Director commands an average salary of $322,484.', 'Speaking of high salaries, US companies are observing a 33% increase in salaries for fully in-office roles that reached an average of $82,037 by March 2024, compared to $59,085 in 2023. This increase is essentially a push from employers to have their workforce back in physical offices. While hybrid and remote options persist, major corporations like Boeing and JPMorgan Chase are mandating full-time office attendance. The decision towards in-office work in the US, where 29% of paid workdays were still remote by January 2024, is driven by employers competing on pay rather than flexibility, according to ZipRecruiter.', 'Conversely, in the UK and Europe, where remote work is less prevalent, the in-person premium trend is expected to be weaker. A survey in the UK in October 2023 showed that only 43% of workers had returned to fully in-office settings. Despite the cost-cutting climate, some employers are willing to increase wage bills for full offices as they believe it will lead to improved business outcomes.', 'Nevertheless, compensation in the tech sector has been largely disappointing in recent times. For example, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) employees have received news of smaller-than-anticipated pay increases, with some even experiencing a decrease in their total compensation packages. This news came during the annual performance review period, typically when employees at Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) learn about adjustments to their salaries, bonuses, and equity grants. Historically, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been known for generous compensation packages, but this year, many employees found their raises smaller than in previous years.', 'Reports indicated that some employees received base pay increases lower than 3% which is way less than the 8% to 10% increases seen in the past. Even those with outstanding performance ratings saw their total compensation decrease, primarily due to minimal raises in base salary, stagnant bonuses, and reduced equity rewards.', 'On the other hand, on February 14, 2024, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit alleging gender-based pay discrimination which affected approximately 4,000 female employees in California. The case was filed in 2017 and claimed that Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) paid male employees in similar roles up to $13,000 more annually than their female counterparts. Despite the settlement, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) did not admit any wrongdoing.', 'The settlement not only involved a major monetary compensation but also included provisions for an independent expert to review Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)’s employment practices to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws.', 'We found the 30 highest paid jobs and occupations in the US after researching the highest-paying professions in the US, from Indeed and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Then we listed the frequently highest-paying jobs in ascending order based on their average salaries.

A: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. I think it's pretty much as you interpreted. It's largely related to doing a little bit better on the shipping delays that we had in Q4. Of course, we did a little bit better than that in terms of Q4 results in general. But even though we're not seeing any negative changes in the business. We also prefer to be a little bit cautious here until we get closer to the second half and have a little bit more visibility."", ""Q: And then maybe on the outlook for China. You pointed to continued challenges there in Q2. That's not exactly a surprise just given the way that things have unfolded this quarter. But it does sound like you expect some deceleration on what is an easier comp. I think the China comp gets 6 points easier next quarter. Is there something to that? And are you seeing any of the green shoots that have been discussed a little bit across the earnings cycle this quarter? A: I can take this, Dan. Look, we have been definitely pleased that we have seen a somewhat better result in Q1 than we had expected. That said, we still expect it to be quite weak. I mean, as Shawn said, we'll have more than 20% decline in China second quarter based on the very tough compares we see against Q2 last year and the years before where there has been quite heavy investment in China. There was significant spending during COVID and also some, of course, inventory buildup, et cetera."", ""Q: I was wondering if you could just reflect on the first quarter a little bit. You posted flat local currency growth, you were guiding to down 4% to 6%, about a point came from better capture of logistics. Where did the rest of the upside come from? Can you just walk us through that? A: Yes. Thanks, Jack. Hey, the rest of it, we -- despite being down 6%, excluding the shipping benefit, we're pleased we did better than expected. We kind of expected customers to start a little more cautiously this year. I think they did start cautiously, but we're glad that they didn't -- they weren't as cautious as maybe we were thinking at the beginning of the quarter."", ""Q: Great. And then do you mind just walking us through in terms of the guide for 2Q and the full year just by segment, what the expectations are? A: Yes, sure. So let me start by business area. So our Q2 guide for Lab is to be down low single digit and for the full year to be up low- to mid-single digit. Product inspection, I don't know if I could also maybe add, if you exclude the shipping delay for the full year, that would be flattish."", ""Q: Congrats on a good Q1 execution. Maybe Shawn, for you, you beat Q1 by 500 basis points, right, at the minimum relative to your expectations. So that's annualized 125 basis points which you've raised guidance by 50 basis points, so did anything changed around the back half assumptions that makes you perhaps want to be a little bit more cautious? A: No. Vijay, thanks for the question. No, I mean, we're not seeing -- I want to be clear, we're not seeing anything negative or new negative changes in the business. We just feel like it's still a little bit early in the year. We only have 1.5 months' worth of backlog, and we're just a little bit cautious here kind of going into the second quarter."", 'Q: Understood. And maybe Patrick, for you as a follow-up. Shawn mentioned visibility for back half and backlog, right? What is typical backlog for Mettler? When you say visibility, is that sort of being driven by funnel activity, customer conversations or are you hoping -- or do you have any expectations for China stimulus to play out in the back half? A: Thanks for the question, Vijay. Look, as Shawn just said, we have about 1.5 months of backlog. So we have a pretty fast turnover in most of our businesses. When we look at the second half, again, the comps will get much easier for us based on what we have seen last year. So that, of course, implies a positive growth for the second half.', 'For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Let me now turn the call over to Patrick.', 'Patrick Kaltenbach: Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Last night, we reported our first quarter financial results, the details of which are outlined for you on Page 3 of our presentation. Overall, our results in the first quarter were much better than anticipated across most product categories and geographies. As discussed last quarter, we also had a benefit this quarter from recovering delayed product shipments from the fourth quarter. However, we recovered more than expected and shipped nearly all of our delayed orders and are glad to have this disruption behind us. While our team executed well this quarter, underlying market demand is still soft, especially in China and there remains considerable uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment.', 'We continue to maintain a cautious outlook and we will -- and we still expect to return to sales growth in the second half of the year, largely due to easier comparisons. Otherwise, we remain focused on executing on our growth and productivity initiatives, so we will emerge stronger as our markets improve. Let me now turn the call over to Shawn to cover the financial results for the quarter and our guidance for this year and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business. Shawn?', 'Shawn Vadala: Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Sales in the quarter were $926 million, largely unchanged from prior year levels, both on a US dollar basis and in local currencies. Our sales in the quarter benefited by approximately 6% from recovering nearly all of our previously disclosed delayed product shipments from the fourth quarter of 2023, above our guidance of an approximate benefit of 5%. On Slide number 4, we show sales growth by region. Local currency sales grew 6% in Europe and 3% in the Americas and declined 8% in Asia/Rest of the World. Local currency sales in China declined 19% in the quarter. Excluding the benefit from recovering our fourth quarter shipping delays, we estimate our sales in Q1 declined about 6% with the Americas down approximately 1%, Europe down approximately 5%, and Asia/Rest of the World down approximately 12%, including a 21% sales decline in China.', 'On Slide number 5, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. For the quarter, laboratory sales increased 2% and industrial sales were flat with core -- with both core industrial and product inspection flattish. Food retail declined 9%. Service sales grew 6% in the quarter. Excluding the Q4 shipping delay benefit, we estimate laboratory product sales declined approximately 6%, industrial declined 3% with core industrial down 4%, and product inspection flattish, and food retail declined 15%. Let me now move to the rest of the P&L, which is summarized on Slide number 6. Gross margin was 59.2%, an increase of 30 basis points due to improved productivity, positive pricing, and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume and currency headwinds.', 'R&D amounted to $46.4 million in the quarter, unchanged in local currency over the prior period. SG&A amounted to $234.4 million, a 1% decrease in local currency compared to the prior year, and includes benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted operating profit amounted to $267.3 million in the quarter, approximately flat with the prior year amount. Unfavorable foreign currency was a headwind to adjusted operating profit of approximately 4%. Adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, which represents an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. A couple of final comments on the P&L. Amortization amounted to $18.2 million in the quarter, interest expense was $19.2 million and other income amounted to $0.3 million. Our effective tax rate was 19% in the quarter.', ""This rate is before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option exercises. Fully diluted shares amounted to $21.5 million, which is approximately a 3% decline from the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $8.89, a 2% increase over the prior year or plus 7% excluding unfavorable foreign currency. On a reported basis, EPS was $8.24 as compared to $8.47 in the prior year. Reported EPS in the quarter included $0.24 of purchase intangible amortization, $0.36 of restructuring costs, and a $0.05 tax headwind from the timing of option exercises. That covers the P&L and let me now comment on cash flow. In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $182.3 million, a 39% increase on a per share basis from the prior year levels due to favorable working capital, including lower cash incentive payments related to last year's performance."", 'Let me now turn to our guidance for the second quarter and the full year. As you review our guidance, please keep in mind the following factors. First, while we do not see any negative change in business conditions today, we continue to take a cautious approach with our forecast and expect our customers will be conservative with their investments in the second quarter. We also expect our sales in China to decline over 20% again in the second quarter before returning to growth in the second half against significantly easier year-ago comparisons. Additionally, there is uncertainty in the economy and geopolitical risks, which also has created volatility in foreign exchange rates. Lastly, as mentioned last year, we will face higher variable compensation this year relative to prior year levels.', 'Now turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect local currency sales to decline approximately 4%. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.90 to $9.05. Currency for the quarter at recent spot rates would be an approximately -- approximate 2% headwind to second quarter sales and adjusted EPS. For the full year 2024, we expect local currency sales to grow approximately 2%, which is up from our previous guidance of approximately 1% to 2% growth. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $39.90 to $40.40, which compares to our prior guidance of $39.60 to $40.30. This includes an expected headwind to sales of 1% and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 2% from unfavorable foreign exchange. Lastly, I would like to share a few other details on our 2024 guidance to help you as you update your models.', ""We expect total amortization, including purchased intangible amortization to be approximately $73 million. Purchased intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted EPS and is estimated at $26 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.95 per share. Interest expense is forecast at $82 million for the year and other income is estimated at approximately $2 million. We expect our tax rate before discrete items will remain at 19% in 2024. We expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $850 million, representing a conversion of approximately 100% of adjusted net income. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $850 million in 2024. That's it from my side, and I'll now turn it back to Patrick."", 'Patrick Kaltenbach: Thanks, Shawn. Let me start with some comments on our operating businesses, starting with Lab. As Shawn mentioned earlier, excluding the Q4 shipping delay benefits this quarter, local currency sales in our Laboratory business declined approximately 6% compared to last year. This was better than we anticipated, but we saw cautious spending patterns from our pharma and biopharma customers, especially in China. We have a very strong product portfolio and pipeline of new innovations that directly address our customer needs for solutions that enhance their productivity and ensure regulatory compliance. Combined with the enhancements we have made on our Spinnaker sales and marketing program. Our go-to-market approach is a significant competitive differentiator during this period of reduced end-market demand.', ""Our industrial sales for the quarter were also better than we had expected and declined about 3%, excluding the benefit of shipping delays. Our sales of core industrial products have performed better than we would have expected in a soft economic environment, benefiting from our upgraded portfolio of products that enable automation and digitalization in our customers' production and logistics facilities. We also continue to be optimistic about growth opportunities related to onshoring and nearshoring as customers aim to increase resiliency in their supply chains. Our product inspection business also had better-than-expected performance in a soft market environment with benefits from recent product introductions and strong service growth. Lastly, food retail sales declined in line with our expectations against significant project-driven sales growth in the first quarter of last year."", 'Now let me make some additional comments by geography. Starting in the Americas. Our sales declined slightly in the quarter, excluding the benefit from recovering of our shipping delays. We benefited from strong project-related growth in industrial, which was offset by a decline in lab and retail. As expected, our customers have been somewhat cautious starting the year, especially in pharma and biopharma, which we expect to improve as we face easier comparisons in the second half of the year. Retail also faced very difficult comparisons related to very strong growth in the prior year. Sales in Europe, excluding the estimated benefit from recovering our European logistics hub delays, declined about 5% and were largely in line with our expectations across each of our businesses.', ""We continue to see soft economic indicators across most of Europe and acknowledge the potential risk to the European economy and energy prices from the conflict in the Middle East. However, we had a very strong team and go-to-market approach that positions us very well to capture growth opportunities. Lastly, Asia/Rest of the World results were also slightly better than expected, although demand in China remains very weak relative to very strong growth over the past few years. We continue to target pockets of growth opportunities, including semiconductor and new energy industries, and our approach to the market has remained a significant competitive advantage against the competition. Those are all my comments on the businesses for the quarter, and I'd now like to share with you why we are so optimistic on the long-term growth opportunity for our company."", 'First, I have been in the life science and analytical tools industry for a long time and believe the exciting advancements our customers are bringing to the market will continue to support healthy market growth in our industry over the long term. We also see many new opportunities in fast-growing segments such as sustainable materials, semiconductors, and alternative energy. Our customers also continue to look to us to help them achieve their goals, including improving productivity and quality, while supporting their efforts in automation and digitalization. Our very broad and diverse portfolio of solutions is an important differentiator and we lead the industry with new innovations for our target markets. Innovation is at the heart of our culture and is essential to our continued success.', 'We are constantly coming out to market with new products and have accelerated our rate of innovation over the past few years. New products help stimulate replacement cycles, support market share gains, and enhance our value proposition that support our pricing. We are uniquely positioned to serve customers throughout the value chain from R&D through production and logistics. This also creates a tremendous opportunity for us to add automation and digitalization features to our products and drive productivity and provide insights throughout the value chain. Over the past three years, we have invested over $0.5 billion in research and development into three key areas. First, technology advancements to support new products and features that increase the value of our products.', ""Second, application and software development to complement our products. And third, design enhancements to simplify manufacturing and serviceability of our products. The significant investments we are making have been an important contributor to expanding our innovation leadership and market share gains. I'd like to share a few examples of innovations we have recently brought to market and why we are so excited about our future. I'll start with our biggest launch of the year, our entirely new and redesigned portfolio of standard and advanced level laboratory balances, which you may have seen featured in our annual report. We are the global market leader in laboratory weighing, but also have ample room to gain further market share that includes expanding our access to growth segments."", 'Our new range of balances address this opportunity with the best products for entry-level applications all the way up to advanced weighing requirements. They feature increased robustness, seamless data management, a harmonized user interface, and up to 30% better measurement and performance. Our design approach also improves sustainability, and using improved packaging and reducing their power consumption. Weighing is a critical step in the sample preparation process and our LabX software connects our higher-end balances to our broad portfolio of analytical instruments to help automate workflows and ensure secure and compliant data capture. This is a very important competitive advantage considering we provide about 40% of the instruments that are found in a typical quality control lab and we recently introduced several new analytical instruments with new automation and digitalization features.', 'For example, we are the global number two player in titration and last month, we launched two completely new Karl Fischer titrator models. Our new EVA titrators are ideal for efficiently determining the water content of challenging samples and our new control algorithm speeds up reaction rates and allows for faster analysis and cycle times. It also has an automated solvent exchange system that ensures safety by minimizing exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals. Importantly, our new titrators have full compatibility with our LabX software to enable automated seamless workflows with secure data management, all while complying with data integrity regulations. Hot segments have been an important driver of growth for analytical instruments and water determination through titration is an important part of lithium battery production.', ""Our Voice of Customer program, Jetstream uncovered a specific customer need in the market to be able to analyze multiple samples with only one titration instrument. To address this, our team developed a new automated sample prep solution, the InMotion Karl Fischer Six that is used with our titrator. With our InMotion Six, customers can process up to six samples fully automatically and unattended with only one titrator, addressing our customers' need for a cost-effective solution on a very small footprint. Automation has also been an important differentiator for our thermal analysis customers in fast-growing markets such as development of new materials, and we recently introduced a new thermal analysis instrument called the DSC 5+ with a fully automated sample changer."", ""This instrument also increases the efficiency of the entire workflow from sample handling to result assessment, generating reproducible results with less resources. Our Artificial Intelligence Wizard software automatically detects and evaluates many types of thermal effects, saving valuable time and providing consistent and reliable measurement results regardless of the user's level of experience. Our software also has a -- has different neural networks that are trained on dedicated data, so customers can download the most appropriate package for their experiment. Our core industrial business has been very successful in integrating advanced automation and connectivity features into its products and has focused its new product development on terminals and digital load cells that provide seamless integration into factory automation systems."", ""A great example of this is our Industry 360 terminal, which is an ultra-fast weight indicator for automated filling, dosing, and tank weighing applications across a variety of industries from biopharma to food manufacturing. The terminal connects our scales and weighing sensors and seamlessly integrates our pre-programmed ready-to-use weighing applications into a customer's programmable logic controllers for process control automation. It also seamlessly feeds data to customer IT systems and because of our unique ability to combine IT and operations technology communication on a single network, it saves customers integration and programming cost and time and eliminates the need for an additional gateway to the server or cloud. This product line has been very successful and new derivatives like our Industry 700 and Industry 400 have been very recently launched to further expand our portfolio."", 'We have also expanded our capabilities in pharma manufacturing IT systems, helping customers by having a simplified and standardized integration of our weighing solutions. These advanced terminals also connect to our new PHD low-profile hygienic floor scale family that offers unmatched hygiene and safety features. Our new scales are very well suited for industries like pharma where cleanliness is paramount. These scales offer a unique fully sealed design that reduces contamination risks and simplify cleaning procedures and also has a state-of-the-art digital load cell. We have had great success with the 2023 launch of this product and we believe this and other new core industrial products have been very important contributor to the relative resilience of this business over the past year.', 'We have also recently launched several new products across our product inspection business over the past year that are highly differentiated and bring considerable value to the customers. We expect these innovations, including our new series of X-ray inspection technology to help drive market-share gains, especially in the mid-market segment. We have an excellent pipeline of new -- of innovations of product inspection that will further build on our market leadership. Lastly, we are also pleased with our success of food retail business that -- they have seen with new product introductions like our FreshBase scales, which has an important -- which was an important contributor to the market share gains and strong sales growth last year. Additionally, our new FreshBase Plus AI scale with advanced image recognition technology is an exciting innovation we are looking forward to bringing to additional markets outside of China.', ""So that is a brief overview of a few new products we have launched over the past year. And we have many more to come this year as we have accelerated certain innovation investments to capture growth opportunities. These investments continue to provide a portfolio that is stronger than ever and continues to increase our value proposition and most importantly help our customers gain new insights, increase their productivity, and ensure regulatory compliance throughout their value chain.

That's an age-old debate in the dividend investing world that keeps surfacing intermittently. Analysts tend to lean toward dividend growth as it indicates a healthy financial situation, whereas excessively high yields might suggest underlying financial troubles. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has delivered strong returns in the past. In a blog post published in January 2019 titled “Exploring Dividend Growth Strategies for Market Downturns”, S&P’s Phillip Brzenk, global head of multi-asset indexes, analyzed how dividend growth strategies perform, particularly when the market experiences negative trends. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“Since year-end 1989, there have been six calendar years of negative performance for the S&P 500—and in all six years, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the equity benchmark by an average of 13.28%. In fact, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats produced a positive total return in three of those years.”', 'In addition to this, the performance of dividend aristocrats has shown a consistent upward trend in different market conditions when compared with high-yield stocks. According to data from Bloomberg, dividend aristocrats delivered a 12.50% return in falling interest rate periods and an 11.55% return in rising interest rate periods between February 2005 and December 2023. On the other hand, Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index returned 7.90% and 10.46% returns during falling and rising interest rate periods, respectively, underperforming dividend growth stocks.', 'Though dividend growth stocks are preferred over high-yield stocks, our research shows that a balance of both can offer advantages to investors, potentially maximizing risks while eliminating risks.

Shares still trade at a reasonably priced valuation, and the company's dividend is growing at a double-digit rate in the high teens."", ""There's a lot to like about American Express stock, starting with its growth profile."", ""The company's revenue rose 11% year over year in its first quarter and earnings per share soared 39%. Even more, management said in its first-quarter update that it expects full-year revenue to grow at a rate of between 9% to 11%, with earnings per share rising about 13% to 17%."", 'The integrated payments company, which largely caters to the premium segment of the credit card industry, has impressive momentum in its business.', '""We continued to drive strong customer engagement, and demand for our premium products remained robust,"" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri in the company\'s first-quarter earnings release. ""We added 12.2 million new proprietary cards in the year, bringing the total number of cards-in-force issued on our global network to over 140 million.""', 'Equally as important, American Express emphasized that its credit metrics ""remained strong"" during the quarter. Write-off and delinquency rates, management explained, continue to track below pre-pandemic levels.', 'Making the stock even more attractive is its dividend. Management announced earlier this year that it was raising its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70. This comes out to $2.80 annually, giving American Express a dividend yield of about 1.2%.', ""The company's most recent increase in its dividend puts the spotlight on the payout's recent impressive track record of growth. The company has increased its dividend at rates between 17% and 21% each year since 2022. Further, though American Express did pause its dividend increases during the COVID-19 pandemic years, it notably never put the dividend payment itself on hold. The company, therefore, boasts a long track record of consecutive dividend payments -- going all the way back to 1985."", 'Looking ahead, more dividend growth from American Express is almost inevitable. Not only is the underlying business growing nicely but the company has an extremely low payout ratio. Paying out just 20% of its earnings in dividend payments, there is significant room for dividend growth in the years ahead.', ""Overall, American Express looks like a very attractive long-term investment. Of course, there are always risks. For instance, American Express has a liability-sensitive business model since it provides the capital for its credit card users. The stock, therefore, could take a hit during a recession if it negatively impacts the spending and credit quality of its customers. For these reasons, it would be wise to keep any purchase of the stock small as a percentage of an investor's total portfolio."", 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

According to one of them, companies that control a market can lower the quality of their products with impunity.', ""However, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), a drugmaker with a monopoly in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, hasn't done that -- quite the contrary. Since it launched its first CF product some 12 years ago, the biotech hasn't stopped innovating and improving its lineup. And it still isn't done. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is making steady progress toward earning approval for a new CF medicine."", 'CF is a rare disease that disrupts the proper functioning of internal organs, including the lungs and the pancreas. Though standards of care existed before Vertex, the biotech developed the only medicines in the world that target the underlying genetic causes of the illness. Its success in the past 12 years directly results from this work, though many have tried to emulate it.', ""So far, no other drugmaker has successfully challenged Vertex Pharmaceuticals in this area. And while others still struggle to produce positive clinical trial results in CF, Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't have that problem."", 'In February, the biotech released data from several phase 3 studies for its next-gen CF therapy, vanza triple. The study pitted this newer product against Trikafta, which was itself a groundbreaking medicine capable of treating up to 90% of CF patients, approved in 2019.', ""During the trial, vanza triple showed non-inferiority against Trikafta in improving lung functions in CF patients. In layman's terms, the trial candidate did not perform worse than the compared drug (in this case, Trikafta) by more than a pre-specified amount. Furthermore, the new therapy was superior in reducing sweat chloride, the presence of which, in high levels, often indicates CF."", ""Here's the kicker: While Trikafta is taken twice a day, vanza triple boasts a convenient once-daily dosing. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently announced regulatory submissions for vanza triple in the U.S., and in Europe for patients six years and older, with more applications on the way."", ""Trikafta is currently responsible for practically all of Vertex's sales. In the first quarter, the company's revenue increased by 13% to $2.7 billion. Trikafta revenue accounted for 92% of that total. Vanza triple will likely attract many eligible patients and somewhat cannibalize Trikafta's sales; according to some estimates, it could generate sales of $1.26 billion by 2028. Since this product will address a share of the market Vertex Pharmaceuticals already owns, it wouldn't substantially improve its prospects."", 'But more importantly, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is once again flexing its innovative muscles and succeeding where others keep failing. The biotech is now expanding its areas of focus. It recently earned approval for Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy developed with CRISPR Therapeutics. It started a rolling submission in the U.S. for suzetrigine, a treatment for acute pain.', 'Vertex also kicked off a phase 3 study for inaxaplin to treat APOL-1 mediated kidney disease. This program looks particularly exciting. There are no approved therapies that treat the underlying causes of this disease. Yet Vertex Pharmaceuticals estimates that 100,000 patients suffer from it, more than the 92,000 CF patients in its target geographies.', ""Could Vertex Pharmaceuticals repeat the success it had in CF with inaxaplin? Maybe, but the company's prospects don't depend on a single product or pipeline candidate. The bottom line is Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a well-run, innovative biotech company that should continue delivering market-beating returns for a long time. The stock is an excellent investment for investors looking for a stable, but growing, business."", 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

Here are two top stocks to consider buying now that you can hold for at least a decade.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) hasn't been resting on its laurels. The ongoing success of its market-leading cystic fibrosis drug franchise has paved the way to a bright future as it continues to develop an impressive lineup of medicines targeting various rare, underserved diseases."", 'In the first quarter of 2024, the company reported total profits of $1.1 billion on revenue of $2.7 billion. Those two figures represented respective increases of 57% and 13% from the same quarter in 2023. Vertex closed out the three-month period with a hefty $10 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet.', ""Vertex continues to benefit from high demand for its cystic fibrosis drugs. These drugs are helping patients live better and longer because they target the underlying genetic factors that cause cystic fibrosis. That durable need for Vertex's medicines, additional label expansions to younger groups of cystic fibrosis patients, and a massive patient population continue to form a wide moat for this mainstay of Vertex's business."", ""Meanwhile, the company is looking to a new era of growth as it plans multiple new product launches before the end of the decade, each with significant blockbuster potential. It's in the process of launching its new gene editing therapy Casgevy, which it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics and which serves as a onetime functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia."", ""Vertex just completed regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU for its new triple combination cystic fibrosis therapy for patients aged six and up, which addresses 31 rare mutations that Vertex's current lineup of medicines do not."", 'Management has also estimated that over 6,000 patients who have stopped taking its existing drugs might be interested in this new treatment option. This is just a fraction of the total addressable market for its cystic fibrosis franchise that Vertex previously estimated at around 92,000 people in Europe, North America, and Australia alone.', ""Suzetrigine is another potential blockbuster for Vertex, as a non-opioid drug that addresses multiple acute pain ailments. Vertex has initiated its rolling new drug application submission for Suzetrigine to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for moderate-to-severe acute pain. It's about to start the phase 3 trial studying the drug as a treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy."", ""These are just a handful of the exciting updates about Vertex's pipeline. It also just announced that it plans to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences, a company that makes protein-based medicines for various immune disorders. The company's lead candidate, povetacicept, is being developed as a treatment for the underlying cause of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), which no commercialized drug currently addresses."", 'Vertex is already coming from a position of considerable strength with its market leadership in cystic fibrosis therapies that underpin a rock-solid balance sheet.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors.

The Company has commenced a modified ""Dutch Auction"" tender offer to repurchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $1.672 billion (the ""tender offer"").', '""This tender offer reflects our confidence in the future outlook of our business, the strength of our commercial product portfolio and our clinical development pipeline and Incyte’s long-term value. We believe the current valuation of Incyte stock makes repurchases of our stock an attractive investment and an opportunity to enhance long-term shareholder value,"" said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte.

Advisors LP (collectively, the ""Baker Entities""), to repurchase up to $328.0 million of the Company’s common stock. This would enable the Baker Entities to maintain their current ownership level of approximately 16.4 percent of Incyte’s outstanding common stock. The Baker Entities purchase will be at the same price per share as is determined and paid in the tender offer.', 'Modified ""Dutch Auction"" Tender Offer', 'Incyte is offering to purchase up to $1.672 billion in value of its common stock at a price not greater than $60.00 per share nor less than $52.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the tender offer documents that are being distributed to stockholders. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change the per share purchase price options and to increase or decrease the aggregate value of shares sought in the tender offer, subject to applicable law. In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), Incyte may purchase in the offer up to an additional 2 percent of its outstanding shares without amending or extending the tender offer. On May 10, 2024, the Nasdaq closing price of the common stock was $53.06 per share. The tender offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, at the end of the day, New York City time, on Monday, June 10, 2024, unless extended.', 'A modified Dutch Auction tender offer allows stockholders to indicate how much stock they wish to tender and at what price within the range described above. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, Incyte will determine the lowest price per share that will enable it to purchase $1.672 billion of common stock at such price, or a lower amount depending on the number of shares that are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn. All stock purchased in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price, even if a stockholder tendered at a lower price, so in some cases Incyte may purchase stock at a price above the price indicated by the stockholder tendering that stock. Incyte will not purchase stock below a stockholder’s indicated price. If the tender offer is fully subscribed, then $1.672 billion of common stock at the purchase price determined by Incyte will be purchased (subject to Incyte’s above-referenced ability to increase such numbers of shares), representing approximately 12.4 percent to 14.3 percent of outstanding common stock as of May 9, 2024, depending on the purchase price payable for those shares pursuant to the tender offer. Tenders of shares must be made prior to the expiration of the tender offer and may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration thereof.', 'If, at the final purchase price, shares representing more than $1.672 billion of common stock at the applicable purchase price (or such greater number of shares as Incyte may choose to purchase without amending or extending the offer) are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn, Incyte will purchase shares tendered at or below that price on a pro rata basis. The tender offer will not be conditioned on any minimum number of shares being tendered and will not be subject to a financing condition; however, the tender offer is subject to a number of other conditions described in the tender offer documents.', 'While Incyte’s Board of Directors has authorized the Company to make the tender offer, none of Incyte, its Board of Directors, the dealer manager or the information agent makes any recommendation to any stockholder as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering any shares or as to the price or prices at which stockholders may choose to tender their shares. Incyte has not authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Stockholders must decide whether to tender their shares and, if so, how many shares to tender and at what price or prices. In doing so, stockholders should carefully evaluate all of the information in the tender offer documents before making any decision with respect to the tender offer and should consult their own financial and tax advisors.', 'This press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of common stock.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:', '10% = US$663m ÷ US$6.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Estée Lauder Companies has a lower ROE than the average (14%) in the Personal Products industry classification."", ""That certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved.  Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""Estée Lauder Companies does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.18. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

This makes the dividend yield 2.1%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.', ' See our latest analysis for Union Pacific ', ""If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Union Pacific was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 37.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 40%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.38 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $5.20. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, Union Pacific has only grown its earnings per share at 5.0% per annum over the past five years. Growth of 5.0% may indicate that the company has limited investment opportunity so it is returning its earnings to shareholders instead. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future."", 'Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Union Pacific that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
